Many residents of Jackson, Miss., remain without running water three weeks after a winter storm hit the city.

The water outages in Jackson began Feb. 15 as a winter storm swept across the state. The storm brought devastating, bitter cold to the South and hit the region's critical infrastructure hard--highlighting major vulnerabilities in the area's power grid and water system.

Some water treatment plants in the city couldn't operate in the freezing temperatures that lingered for days. Because plants were shut down for so long, water pressure in the city dropped.

As of March 3, service had been restored in some areas, but a boil water notice remained in effect for many residents, according to city officials.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said March 1 in a Twitter post that the city has ""made some strides"" restoring water service, but more work needs to be done.

But the timeline of when full water service could be restored is unclear.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the plants are back online, but the water pressure needs to be at a consistent rate for it to reach the homes farthest from the treatment plants.

In the meantime, city officials and the National Guard are distributing non-potable water to people. That water can be used to flush toilets, but can be used for little else.

In the meantime, residents such as Wayne Johnson are traveling through the city filling milk jugs and other containers with water. Johnson told NPR his elderly neighbor has been without water since Feb. 16.

He said, ""She's elderly, she can't handle jugs of water so I'm catching water. Got coolers and jugs and everything else. I'm filling bathtubs up with water and everything else to flush and do what we can.""

Lumumba said the water system's failure has only served to highlight issues that have existed for decades. He said the city needs state and federal funding to help replace 100-year-old pipes.

He said, ""They have been described as peanut brittle when our crews jump into holes in order to repair them. Sometimes they'll repair one break, stay for a little while, and see another break happen mere yards away from the one that they just repaired.""","Like 'Peanut Brittle': Mississippi Water Crisis Highlights Infrastructure ProblemsEnlarge this image toggle caption Rogelio V.

1,"Mar 3, 2021",Jackson Free Press,Jackson’s Water Crisis Lingers into March,"Robert Sulton has lived in south Jackson since 2007, when he and his wife built their home just north of Byram. They had experienced power outages and boil-water notices before, but none as bad as the last two weeks of February 2021.

""I guess you take a lot for granted when you have water to just be able to turn on the faucet and see the water running or do whatever, but when you don't have it, I mean, it's a humbling experience,"" Sulton told the Jackson Free Press. ""It really is.""

Sulton was one of many south Jackson residents who would be without water for the better part of February, when a winter storm battered the state for days.

On the night of Feb. 11, temperatures in Jackson plummeted to freezing, and then they stayed that way. For the next nine days, Jackson stood still through bitter days and frozen nights. As the cold lingered, city infrastructure incurred increasingly alarming damage.

Left without water, Sulton explained his frustrations and hopes with the city. He has lived in and around Jackson since 1985, when he moved here to attend Jackson State University. He has moved around the area since then, but built his home in south Jackson in 2007, nearer to Byram but still within Jackson.

But Sulton's frustrations are not just about water.

Neglected South, West Jackson

Before the storm, Sulton and his entire neighborhood had to deal with the smell of sewage coming from what amounted to a drainage ditch that reeked like a sewage tap near their homes.

They breathed the putrid air from the fall of 2020 until recently before the winter storm hit, though Sulton is not sure if the problem might creep back up when temperatures rise.

He and his wife first lost most of their water pressure on Feb. 16, and power the next day. Their power outage lasted until Feb. 20, but as of March 2, they, like many Jackson residents, did not have working faucets or safe water.

Sulton counts himself lucky compared to some, because he is able to stay at a hotel when necessary. ""It's very frustrating, he said. Even with the ability to stay at hotels, their lives are disrupted.

""There's a lot of riding, there's a lot of driving back and forth,"" he said.

Still, Sulton has hope for Jackson.

""Jackson has so much potential,"" he said. ""I mean the entire city. I think a lot of times the leadership of the city gets pigeonholed into focusing on certain parts of the city, and I think the western and southern parts of the city get neglected. Those are the areas where you have the most people, and I think that this is putting a gigantic spotlight on that.

""It's kind of glaring that the area of the city with water is the area that the City has continually focused on and that's out north, and then the area that's been neglected is the areas that are suffering right now. So hopefully, hopefully, these spotlights will help to change some things.""

'I Owe You Honesty'

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba held numerous press events to relay the status of repairs in the city as they happened. ""I owe you honesty,"" Lumumba said on Feb. 18. ""I owe you the truth so that we can prepare for how we manage through this winter emergency.""

Even as the mayor explained how workers were clearing away tree limbs and repairing power lines, he could not give an estimate of when water might return to the city. ""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Lumumba said. ""Only to tell you that we are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover within the water system.""

As the days wore on, Lumumba and Jackson officials announced various locations for water giveaways, which are still ongoing as of press time. Non-potable water was available at fire stations around the city, and drinking water is distributed at various times and locations daily.

Even the New Orleans Pelicans basketball organization was sending two truckloads of water to Jackson after a tweet from Jackson author and superfan Angie Thomas.

""We understand our residents' frustration, I understand that most people don't care how a watch works,"" Lumumba said in a Feb. 22 press briefing. ""They just want to be able to tell time.""

Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who had endorsed Lumumba for his first term, took aim at the mayor's response, accusing his administration of being too slow to respond to the crisis and calling for faster action in distributing reserve water tankers. For his part, Lumumba defended his actions, calling the storm an ""act of God.""

'Hundred Year Old Pipes'

As the winter storm swept the country, it exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities in cities across the South.

Public Works Director Williams, who had worked with Jackson's infrastructure for 19 years before accepting his current leadership post, described the history and issues surrounding Jackson's and the country's, aging infrastructure in an interview with the Jackson Free Press on Feb. 28.

""The U.S. is not getting younger, it's getting older,"" Williams said. ""A lot of the infrastructure that was put in in the late 1800s, early 1900s. They have seen their life expectancy, but yet they're still utilizing those infrastructure assets now,"" Williams said. ""And so it's time to dedicate some resources toward upgrades.""

A 2013 water assessment concluded that Jackson did indeed have 100-year-old piping in many areas. ""Those pipes are now a lot older,"" Williams said. ""There's a lot of iron pipe in Jackson, and there's concrete pipe in Jackson, and they need to be upgraded.""

In addition to unreliable and, for now, unsafe city water mains, older residential piping may still harbor a more insidious contaminant—lead. The question of lead contamination in Jackson water remains year after year, arising especially when treated city water contains a certain chemistry capable of wearing away old lead joints in residential piping, as happened in 2016.

In that year, the alkaline levels raised concerns that treated city water may chemically melt the mineral coating on lead parts in older homes. This is the same type of alkalinity issue that arose in Flint, Mich., when that city switched water sources.

In Jackson, the majority of tested homes did not have actionable levels of lead, or more than 15 parts per billion. City officials did, however, warn that children and mothers-to-be should avoid drinking tap water until the City resolved the alkalinity issue.

Williams is not aware of any areas that still contain lead piping, but that could be due to insufficient sampling. ""There may be some isolated areas that we don't know about, but we do not know of any areas that do have lead piping or lead joints,"" he said.

Unless funding is increased for broader sampling, however, residents must make do with a do-it-yourself test kit. These kits are $15 to $20 and may be purchased from the Mississippi State Department of Health Public Health Laboratory by calling 601-576-7582 or from Micro-Methods Laboratories at 228-875-6420. The cost pays for the kit, shipping and lab results, which will take two to four weeks to return.

How to Pay for It?

Funding is the looming issue for Jackson's infrastructure upgrades. Jackson's water-treatment facilities, water-collection lines and sewer lines all require upgrades.

""I hope that after this winter storm, and we've seen the impact from Texas all the way to Mississippi and the number of residents that have suffered from a water outage, I think it shows how vulnerable our infrastructure system is and how important it is for us to have funding available to make these critical upgrades,"" Williams said Feb. 28.

""The question is, how are they going to do it? Where are they going to do it?""

As of yet, no discussions are happening between the City of Jackson and the State Legislature to resolve the water crisis, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann confirmed on March 1, indicating that it was the City's responsibility to ask for help. ""Any additional resources that we can get to help address our infrastructure problems I think it's a win-win for our citizens,"" Williams said.

Mayor Lumumba has repeatedly named $2 billion as the cost of repairing and upgrading Jackson's century-old infrastructure, but Williams says calculating an actual cost may be more difficult.

""That depends on where you would disperse those funds,"" he said. ""You've got to remember that you've got different infrastructure systems. You've got drainage issues throughout the city.

You still need funding for roads. And then you've got your utilities on water and sewer.

""So It's very hard to put an exact number on that because when you look at a city of Jackson's size and looking at all of those different infrastructure systems. You would have to look at them each independently and how you want to address them and then determine what kind of cost it would take in order to do all of them separately.""

Williams hopes federal funding will soon become a boon instead of a roadblock.

""We hope in this new administration that they will provide more infrastructure funding to the state and ultimately to municipalities like Jackson,"" he said.

""We need federal assistance in order to assist us, and then we hope that at some point a true infrastructure bill will be provided and the city will become an opportunity to benefit from some of that funding.""

For now, Jackson must wait for the all clear as repairs are completed, and the City awaits a negative test for water contamination.

JACKSON, Miss. – Two weeks into a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, after a series of winter storms, city officials say they do not know how many residents are still without water or when water will be restored.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Tuesday that there are still pockets of homes in south Jackson's high-elevation areas without water, but he could not share a total number of outages.

He said water pressure at the city's treatment plant was gradually being restored, but a firm date for restoration of the system remains elusive.

For more than two weeks, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.

Williams had said he was hopeful the system would be up to speed by Feb. 26, the weekend after the city first reported a water shortage on Feb. 17.

Instead, he said the prolonged freezing temperatures from winter storm systems crippled a system unequipped to deal with the temperature drop.

More than 100 water breaks reported

The system is still not putting out enough water pressure to service its more than 43,000 customers. That has been complicated by water main breaks across the city that have leaked water into city streets and yards. Since the city first reported a water shortage, more than 100 water breaks have been reported. As of Monday night, crews had completed 53 repairs, he said.

Williams said Tuesday that it's possible a large water main break that has not been reported is also siphoning water from the city's water supply.

""A hard number is difficult to track,"" Williams said. ""We would have to go door-to-door to know precisely where all the outages are.""

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has also been been hesitant to give a firm date for recovery of the water system.

The city has been tracking outages through reports from residents and its 311 hotline. The mayor's spokeswoman, Michelle Atoa said that as of Tuesday afternoon the hotline had received more than 1,500 water outage calls since Feb. 15, but she was unable to provide a hard number of residence outages or an estimate.

The mayor's office said in an email that it had crews out Tuesday in south Jackson neighborhoods and in higher elevated areas of the city where residents are still experiencing outages. The crews are testing pressure levels and releasing trapped air from hydrants that may be impeding flow.

Seven distribution sites for non-potable water remain open across the city, and the city is also delivering bottled water to elderly and homebound residents.

3,"Mar 13, 2021",NBC News,"A month without water: In Jackson, Mississippi, struggling residents fear next outage","JACKSON, Miss. — The power was out, the temperature was in the low 20s and the roads bordered on impassable when Vince Gordon lost water at his south Jackson home in mid-February.

His family hunkered down with a generator, and the reserve of water they’d bought in preparation for the winter storm. By the end of the week, the ice had thawed. But when they checked the faucet, nothing came out.

For much of the city, it stayed that way for three weeks. And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city’s water service had been restored, the crisis isn’t over.

At the Global Connection Learning Center, a day care serving 59 children, there’s still tape over the sinks to make sure children don’t use them, as much of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice. Staff members wash the toddlers’ hands and the center's dishes with bottled water instead. Nancy Sylvester, the center’s director, takes bibs and cot covers to her home in nearby Clinton to launder them.

At the height of the crisis, at least 40,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring Byram were estimated to have lost water service. While locals are no longer melting snow or collecting rainwater in buckets to have the ability to flush toilets, officials have not yet been able to prove that most of the city’s water is safe to drink. For many residents, frequenting water giveaways has become a part of their daily routine.

Life these days is about “just getting water and trying to make it work,” said south Jackson resident Alonzo Mabry, who has been scouring the city for free bottled water for his 94-year-old mother, who is bedridden.

Officials hope to begin lifting the boil-water notice by next week, but challenges remain. Absent an overhaul of what Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba has called “peanut brittle”-like infrastructure, and the hundreds of millions of dollars to make it happen, the threat of the next outage looms.

Although previous cold snaps have caused water main breaks, locals say this year’s outage is one of the worst in recent history. Danyelle Holmes, a field director with the Poor People’s Campaign and a Jackson resident, spent much of the past month helping distribute water in the city. She’d seen commercials by international charities showing families and young children filling up buckets and jugs with water. Now this was happening at home.

Holmes is not surprised that the infrastructure in a city where some of the pipes predate the Great Depression “went sour.”

Jackson is a city with an estimated $2 billion infrastructure problem — the cost of overdue water and sewer overhauls — and a $300 million annual budget. Twenty-five percent of residents in Jackson live below the poverty line. The city’s median income is just below $39,000. Although it’s Mississippi’s largest city, Jackson, where 82 percent of residents are Black, has struggled. Decades of white flight have whittled down the city’s economic footing.

“All of this happened to individuals at no fault of their own and yet they have to suffer,” she said.

For years, the city has struggled to collect overdue water bills from residents, while locals have reported receiving astronomical bills of $1,000 or more. In 2014, voters approved an additional 1 percent sales tax to make improvements. That’s brought the city $13 million to $15 million a year for improvements, but it still falls short.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday that his top priority is making sure residents have safe running water again. But he’s also spent time lobbying for funding from the state that could help prevent future crises.

“We’re not done yet,” he said.

The city’s latest chapter in a long history of infrastructure woes started Feb. 15, when a winter storm pummeled Mississippi and much of the South.

In Jackson, critical machinery froze at the city’s water plant. A precipitous drop in water pressure followed, further taxing the city’s water supply as residents kept their faucets dripping in an attempt to prevent pipes from freezing. The gradual return of pressure as temperatures warmed up proved too much for Jackson’s system to handle. Nearly 100 confirmed water breaks in the city followed, creating another setback in efforts to restore water supply.

A coalition of grassroots groups formed a rapid response team to supply water to residents. Organizers also provided cash assistance to locals who had missed work because of the storm or struggled to replace groceries that spoiled when the electricity went out.

Natt Offiah, a volunteer for the effort, monitored the group’s hotline. One woman who called over several days for help was incredulous when she learned the group wasn’t part of a government-led response. Pipes had burst in her home and she was desperate for assistance to stay in a hotel. As the group worked to collect donations to put her up, she told Offiah she’d never heard of a state or federal agency using methods like Cash App to deliver relief funds. She asked if they were a scam.

“I thought this was the government. Do you know if the state is doing anything?” she asked Offiah.

Almost a week would pass before the National Guard arrived to distribute water.

“Right now, we all we got,” Offiah told her, recalling that “her mood changed from anger to frustration to a bit of shock. The disappointment was pointed toward the lack of state response.”

Bailey Martin, a spokeswoman for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves’ office, said the governor had fulfilled several requests made by Hinds County, where Jackson is located, including for water delivery. Reeves, a Republican, signed an executive order on Feb. 23 to deploy the National Guard once local officials made the request, Martin said. Members arrived with four tanker trucks the next day.

She added that Reeves ""couldn't be more proud"" of the work the National Guard and the state's emergency management agency have done over the past 13 months.

Before the recent storm, many residents say a deep freeze in 2018 was a warning shot. Frigid temperatures caused a streak of water main breaks, leaving some locals without water for the week. The event also shut down the city’s schools for several days. Many of the district’s campuses lacked enough water pressure to flush toilets or heat up buildings.

That same month, the city council signaled their support for potential litigation against a private company charged with upgrading the city's water billing system, resulting in an eventual settlement in 2020. Jackson received about $60 million in funds, but steep expenses remain. The past few weeks have further exposed the fragility of the city’s water system.

As crews worked to restore service, Lumumba and the city’s legislative delegation began lobbying top officials in the state for a reprieve. Lumumba drafted a letter to the state’s Republican leadership and the congressional delegation, requesting $47 million in aid.

Another option, introduced by state Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, would allow the city to bring another tax increase before voters for repairs. But the legislation must pass both chambers and cross Reeves' desk before becoming law. As the April 4 end date of the legislative session approaches, it’s unclear if lawmakers will take action.

The city has submitted a damage assessment of $16 million in hopes of securing federal relief. Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, said officials anticipate sending a supplemental request as further costs are determined.

Williams expressed hope Thursday that funds from the latest Covid-19 relief package recently signed by President Joe Biden would trickle down to Jackson and provide a start.

In the meantime, some residents, like Holmes, aren’t waiting for a solution to be sketched out. Climate change that has pushed hotter summers and harsher winters in the region, she said, means the city’s system will be hit again. She’s already discussing with organizers how to prepare for the next one.

“We can never say, ‘we won’t see this day again,’” she said. “We know the next time we experience this, it will be worse.”","And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city’s water service had been restored, the crisis isn’t over.

As power and water outages rock the South, among the hard-hit cities is Jackson, Mississippi, where most residents face little to no water pressure.

""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover.""

""This becomes increasingly challenging"" due to the pandemic, Lumumba said, because so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the length of the cold snap in Jackson has taken a toll on the water production.

""Hopefully by this weekend you will start seeing some pressure build back up and water will slowly be restored,"" Williams said Thursday, adding that it's difficult to give a timeline because the weather impacts are ""unpredictable.""

""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Williams said. ""We're working around the clock.""

On Friday, Williams told reporters there was some progress in the city's water pressure, but it was still hard to predict when people will get their water back. Those who live closer to the city's two water plants should expect to have water sooner than those who live farther away, he said.

Water main breaks are another concern; as of Friday afternoon, there were 13 in the city, with more expected as the ice and snow melts, Williams said.

""We hope that it does not increase very much because that will delay some of the recovery process,"" he said.

A boil water notice was issued Thursday.

Jackson officials are offering water distribution at several sites Friday.

Besides the water emergency, between 18,000 to 19,000 customers in Jackson were without power Thursday, largely due to limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain, the mayor said.

Lumumba warned that roads are still topped with ice and urged caution while driving to get basic necessities.

""This is the time ... to help one another, especially our most vulnerable constituents,"" City Council President Aaron Banks said.

After a week of historic and disastrous snow, ice and cold in the South, the freezing temperatures will soon lift. A hard freeze warning is in effect in Mississippi Friday morning but temperatures are expected to rise this weekend.

An electrical fire at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant caused two service pumps to fail, resulting in a loss of water pressure for Jackson residents for several hours Friday morning.

The cause of the electrical fire, which was contained to a control panel in the operations room of the plant, is now under investigation, Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Armon said.

No one was injured in the fire.

Ward 6 Councilman Aaron Banks, who oversees south Jackson, said he was overwhelmed with calls from concerned residents over the water shortage. The city's monthlong water shortage that began about February 16 is still fresh on their minds, he said.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said at 1 p.m. Friday the plant was delivering about 70 pounds per square inch of pressure, which is below the 90 psi that is required for full water pressure. The danger zone is below 65 psi which is where the city was at Friday morning, causing residents to go without a shower and leaving a trickle of water from their faucets.

Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said the resulting water shortage is another reason why the city needs a backup system.

""We can't make it a couple of hours without the plant pressurizing the system,"" Stamps said. ""This is a resiliency issue that we need to tackle. We need some kind of backup for when something like this happens again.""

Friday's electrical fire comes after the plant lost power about two weeks ago, Williams said. The city is considering purchasing backup generators for both water treatment plants at a cost of $3 to $5 million if it receives water infrastructure funding it has requested. The generators would allow the pumps to function in the case of another power outage, although Williams said a generator would not have helped in Friday's fire.

The Jackson and Ridgeland fire departments responded to the call at about 3:30 a.m., Armon said. He said there was little to no structural damage from the fire. He noted electrical fires are usually caused by several factors, including old equipment, wear and tear, and an overload on the circuits.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba alluded to the outdated infrastructure and equipment at the plant at a press conference at City Hall, but said it was too early to make a connection to Friday's fire.

""I won't indicate that today's fire is based on its age, but I will say we've experienced a number of challenges at our water facilities,"" Lumumba said. ""We know that we have a number of areas that need to be repaired or upgraded, and so, we've seen this has become something we frequent far too often.""

The mayor said he is keeping the city under a state of emergency related to its water infrastructure because it is possible there will be additional issues at the plant until the city is able to fund repairs and upkeep.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil water notice. Williams said the water tanks at the plant need to be replenished before water samples can be taken. That could happen as early as Friday evening, he said.

A water outage in Jackson has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

How did it happen? Here's what to know:

Feb. 16: Winter weather and icy temperatures choked equipment at the city's water treatment plants, rendering water pressure inadequate. It caused nearly 43,000 water customers in Jackson to be placed under a boil-water advisory.

Sanitizing water without electricity: Mississippians without power might not be able to boil water, but they can disinfect it. Here's how.

Feb. 18: City of Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced the capital city did not have a definitive timeline for total water restoration. Public Works Director Charles Williams noted water main breaks popping up that were further complicating the process of getting water to residents. Water distribution sites began to lace the city, and fire stations made available non-potable water for residents.

Feb. 22: The state health department recorded 300,000 customers under boil water advisories across Mississippi.

Convenience and grocery stores across the city saw a surge in demand for bottled water as many residents did not have running of safe water. Their supplies began to run low. City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the city provided over 26,500 bottles of water and around 7,000 gallons of non-potable water.

Feb 23: Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd lent more help to Jackson water customers by securing tankers to provide non-potable water. He also activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.

Feb 24: City Officials say most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week. But they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays. Ten water distribution sites pop up around Jackson.

Feb. 25: Public Works Director Charles Williams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed the plants to pump out more water. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.

Residents reflect: 'We're just not built for this down here': Jackson water crisis is latest chapter in decades-long saga

March 1: Public Works Director Charles Williams said the city's water system was still stabilizing itself and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had since fallen. South Jackson residents continue to struggle with a lack of water and water pressure.

Up to 80 water main breaks were reported between the time the storm hit and March 1. City workers continue to mend the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials man water distribution sites throughout the city.

The Water System Business Administration announced it will offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.

Still no running water: 'A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough': Many South Jackson residents still have no running water

March 2: City officials say they do not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration. Williams, the public works director, explained south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.

March 3: Water intake filters full of clams, mussels, other fish and items force systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had recently seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.

Williams confirms more than 10,000 of the city's water customers did not have any water. The city's aging water infrastructure is the main reason for failure, he said.

March 4: Local media outlets get hold of an email Lumumba sent to Reeves on March 3. Lumumba requested about $47 million in emergency funding from the state and federal government to cover a wide range of projects relating to water system infrastructure.

8,"Mar 5, 2021",Jackson Free Press,"Official: Less Than 5,000 Customers Without Water in Jackson","JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Less than 5,000 water customers were still without service Friday afternoon in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson—a development a top official called “positive progress” for the city of 160,000, where some residents have been without water for three weeks.

“It's been a good day, and we want to continue this trend through the weekend,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said during a Friday news conference.

Williams said almost 42,000 city water customers have now had their water restored. He said he hopes to see service restored to most customers in Jackson by Monday.

Resident Nita Smith and her elderly mother were still without water Friday, marking three weeks since they first lost service.

Smith's mother has diabetes and doesn't drive. She's had to help her mother and the other elderly people on her street get access to water to clean themselves and flush toilets.

She's hopeful that with the progress the city has made in recent days, they'll see water service restored soon.

“I feel like the city of Jackson put its residents under a lot of unnecessary stress,” she said Friday. “It’s very scary to know that you don’t have any water.”

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, had been without water at two of his businesses for more than two weeks. Finally, one got water back Thursday. The other got it Friday.

“WE WILL OPEN SATURDAY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST!” he posted Friday on the Facebook page for Broad Street Bakery and Cafe. “After 17 days without water, we are thankful to announce we are finally reopening on Saturday morning.”

The water shortage in Jackson occurred after a winter storm passed through the region three weeks ago, freezing machinery at the water treatment plant. When it began to thaw, dozens of water mains broke.

The outage left people in the majority-Black city, where close to 30% of 160,000 residents live in poverty, scrambling to find water to flush toilets, bathe and drink. The National Guard was called in to assist at water distribution sites, where people waited for hours in lines of vehicles to fill buckets and bowls with water.

A key focus to recovery has been filling the system’s water tanks. Williams said earlier in the week that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into the treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

Williams said Friday the storage tanks were filling up. He said after 48 hours of consistent water flow, the city can start sampling the water to see about lifting the boil water notice, which has been in effect since Feb. 16.

City workers are still repairing water main breaks. Around 70 have been patched during the last three weeks, according to a news release.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said that the water crisis has been caused in part because of decades of neglect regarding the city's aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson's water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor impacting the city's ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base due to white flight. Jackson's tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools. The city was 60% white in 1970, according to U.S. census data. In 2021, it is more than 80% Black.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

On Wednesday, Lumumba penned a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asking for $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system.

“These improvements are critical to our efforts to ensure that our residents and businesses are not deprived of clean water again,” he wrote.","(AP) — Less than 5,000 water customers were still without service Friday afternoon in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson—a development a top official called “positive progress” for the city of 160,000, where some residents have been without water for three weeks.

City officials said Thursday Jackson's water system still faces numerous challenges from prolonged freezing temperatures and could not say for certain when water will be restored.

Live weather updates: Power outages skyrocket in Mississippi, many roads closed

Since Wednesday, residents across the city have been left with little to no water pressure due to issues with the city's water distribution system. The entire city remains under a boil water notice.

In light of the crisis, the city plans to distribute bottled water and non-potable water to residents at fire stations and city facilities as early as Thursday afternoon, although a specific time was unavailable.

""I owe you honesty. I owe you truth,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday at the city's Real Time Command Center. ""We do not have a definitive timeline on water restoration.""

Public Works Director Charles Williams said it is possible water will be restored by this weekend, but cautioned it is not a certainty given the cold snap.

""The weather system has created havoc on the water distribution system and also on our plants,"" Williams said. ""We knew cold temperatures were coming in but didn't factor the length of time it would be here.

""We're working through different scenarios and hopefully by this weekend it'll be restored. Unfortunately, It's difficult to give a time line.""

Transportation issues have delayed the delivery of chemicals to treat the water and the supply is getting low, officials added. Another factor tied to the shortage is that residents are staying at home during the cold snap and using more water than usual.

The mayor's office in a Wednesday night press release said it has been overwhelmed with calls from residents.

The office is asking for patience and to reserve calls to the following numbers for visible water leaks or urgent needs for assistance: 601-960-1777, 601-960-1781, 601-960-1778, 601-960-0379 or 601-960-1779.

Water distribution sites

Constituent Services Manager Keisha Sanders, who is heading up the bottled water distribution effort, said the city is finalizing delivery of the water with a vendor. Transportation to Jackson has been the biggest hitch holding the delivery up, she said.

When it is available, water will be distributed from the following locations:

Smith-Wills Stadium on Lakeland Drive

Metrocenter Mall

JPD Precinct One, 810 Cooper Rd.

Virgie P. Middleton Community Center, Flag Chapel Road

Jackson Police Officers Training Academy, 3000 St. Charles Road

Willowwood Community Center, 229 Lake Cove Dr.

City of Byram Fire Station

Non-potable water, which is unsafe to drink, will be distributed at fire stations across the city except for Station 20 on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Station 10 on Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Station 22 on Lakeshore Drive.

Between 17,000 to 18,000 residents lost power Wednesday night after a second winter storm system moved in and dropped freezing rain on tree limbs and power lines.

Entergy crews are currently cutting trees and working to restore the outages which occurred in pockets across the city, Lumumba said.

The mayor clarified there have been no rolling blackouts in Jackson as there have been in other cities, despite some claims on social media.

JACKSON, Miss. – A water outage in Jackson, Mississippi, has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil notice has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

Officials in the city of roughly 160,000 people said the water pressure was being restored after it was depleted by a winter storm that passed through the area three weeks ago. In some pockets of the city, largely among higher elevations, residents were still experiencing little to no water pressure as of Monday.

The water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a boil notice issued Feb. 16.

Testing revealed the water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance it may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city Thursday once water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

11,"Feb 19, 2021",The Weather Channel,7 Million Texans Without Clean Water Due To Winter Storms,"At a Glance Power outages dropped to their lowest number since Monday morning.

About 7 million people were under boil water notices.

The winter weather moved east Thursday.

Seven million Texans were under boil water advisories Thursday after a pair of deadly back-to-back winter storms brought record-low temperatures, snow and ice that knocked out power plants and caused pipes to freeze.

Many have been without both power and clean drinking water for days.

About 350,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity in Texas late Thursday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. While that's still a significant number, it's a major improvement over the 4 million outages reported Tuesday and the more than 2.5 million Wednesday night.

While power is back up for many, issues with municipal water supplies continue. More than 7 million people in Texas – or one-fourth of the population – were under boil water notices, according to The Associated Press.

""We were prepared, we thought,"" Austin resident Mariette Hummel told weather.com in an interview Wednesday. ""We had some wood, some starter logs – as much as we could get. We had some gallons of water and some food. But we were not prepared for days and days of no power and no heat.""

(MORE: Latest Winter Storm Forecast)

Hummel was hunkered down with her 7-year-old son. As of Wednesday afternoon, they'd been without power for 60 hours, and without water for over a day. They were hoping the snow they piled up in their bathtub would melt, but so far it was too cold in the house for that to happen.

""I’ve never seen anything like this,"" Hummel said. ""It’s staggering, to be honest. And we’re just trying to make it through.""

Photos circulated on social media of icicles that formed on a ceiling fan inside a home. Grocery stores, if they're open, have long lines and empty shelves. People waited in line for hours to fill propane tanks. Hospitals struggled in the face of outages and at least one major airport shut down.

At least 20 deaths are believed to be connected to the weather this week in Texas, in addition to at least 18 others in 11 different states.

Here's a look at some of the major impacts from the back-to-back storms, named Uri and Viola by The Weather Channel.

The Weather’s Deadly Toll

From carbon monoxide poisoning to falls to car crashes to exposure, more than three dozen deaths have been connected to the extreme winter weather, according to the AP.

One of the deaths in Texas happened Monday night when 23-year-old Kevin Ayala used a generator inside to try to keep the home warm for his wife and young son, KXAS-TV reported. At least two others have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Texas. Four people died in a house fire while their power was out, while others died from car crashes or exposure.

The Louisiana Department of Health reported three weather-related deaths. The latest was a 77-year-old man who drowned after he slipped and fell into a swimming pool in Calcasieu Parish. In Lafayette Parish, a 74-year-old woman died from exposure after she wandered away from her home and a 50-year-old man slipped on ice and hit his head.

A man was found dead Tuesday in a snowbank in northwest Indiana, according to the Porter County Sheriff's Office.

A 25-year-old woman was found dead in a mobile home with no electricity or heat in western Kentucky. Another person in Kentucky died of carbon monoxide poisoning, and a third was killed in a car crash.

Arkansas resident Jessie Roberts, 69, died as he attempted to save a calf stranded on an icy pond at his farm, the Logan County Sheriff's Office said.

In Illinois, one person was killed and another injured when an awning at an off-track betting site collapsed under the weight of snow, according to the Chicago Fire Department.

Other deaths included vehicle crashes in Tennessee and Missouri, a man who fell through ice in Oklahoma, a child who fell through ice in Tennessee, three people who died in a tornado Monday night in North Carolina and four who died from carbon monoxide poisoning over the weekend in Oregon.

Water Outages

Residents in Houston, Austin and several other cities were still under boil water advisories – if water was available at all – as of late Thursday afternoon.

The situation was affecting not just households and businesses but also schools, fire stations and health care facilities.

Hospitals in Austin, for example, were stressed by the outages.

""Because this is a statewide emergency situation that is also impacting other hospitals within the Austin area, no one hospital currently has the capacity to accept transport of a large number of patients,"" St. David's South Austin Medical Center CEO David Huffstutler said in a statement, according to the AP.

Advertisement St. David’s transferred some patients to different hospitals and discharged others after water pressure was lost Wednesday, according to KXAN-TV. Huffstutler told the station that the hospital was also losing heat because water feeds the facility’s boiler.

(MORE: Cold Weather Doesn't Mean Climate Change Isn't Happening)

Officials noted that it was hard to know exactly how many people were completely without water.

Austin Water Director Greg Meszaros estimated the number in his city was ""tens of thousands,"" according to KUT-Radio.

Residents were advised to make sure they know how to shut off their water in case pipes start leaking when it comes back on.

The water issues stem from frozen water lines, power outages that took water plants offline, and a large number of people leaving their faucets dripping. The boil water notices are necessary because whenever water pressure drops there is a chance that groundwater could get into the system, Meszaros said.

Houston's William P. Hobby Airport reopened Thursday morning after being shut down due to a lack of water.

Water outages plagued other states as well.

Louisiana was struggling with 36 water outages in 18 parishes Wednesday night, according to a news release from Gov. Jon Bel Edwards. More than 175 boil water notices were in effect in 39 parishes. In all, more than 1 million people were affected, the governor said.

Edwards sent a letter to the White House requesting an emergency declaration. The state is also grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, as well as still recovering from multiple hurricanes that hit the state last year. Five named storms made landfall in Louisiana, and three of them made NOAA's list of 2021 billion-dollar disasters.

Power Outages

More than 800,000 homes and businesses were still without power in eight states, according to poweroutage.us.

Besides Texas, the states with the most outages as of about 6 p.m. EST Thursday were Mississippi with more than 135,000; Louisiana with about 100,000; Oregon with 89,000; Kentucky with 70,000; and West Virginia with about 60,000. Widespread outages were also still being reported in Virginia, Alabama and Ohio.

In some areas, power was restored after snow and ice earlier in the week, only to be knocked out again.

Many of the outages, especially in Texas, were the result of frozen equipment at power plants and increased demand that forced rotating power outages to keep the grid from shutting down completely. Officials there said the outages that remained Thursday evening were the result of ice and tree damage.

Other Impacts

While the first storm, Uri, is no longer, Winter Storm Viola has dumped several inches of snow in parts of the mid-Atlantic and East and caused ice accumulations in Virginia and North Carolina Thursday.

The governors of North Carolina and Oklahoma have requested federal emergency declarations.

The snow and ice weakened structures and led to hazardous driving conditions.

The top deck of a parking garage collapsed Thursday monring in Lexington, Kentucky, WKYT-TV reported.

In Tennesssee, 12 people were rescued from boats after a dock on the Cumberland River collapsed under the weight of ice and snow, the Nashville Fire Department said in a news release.

The 100-yard dock was already in the water when crews arrived. Boat and dive crews found 12 people in vessels that were sinking and/or taking water. All were safely rescued.

Two airports in Jackson, Mississippi, are shut down due to ice. The Jackson Municipal Airport Authority said Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport and Hawkins field will remain closed until at least Friday.

Air travel also continued to be impacted at several major destinations, according to FlightAware. At least 689 flights are canceled today at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, more than 200 each at Baltimore/Washington and Washington Dulles, and more than 100 at LaGuardia.

Schools in several districts in the Washington, D.C., area canceled classes Thursday, including Anne Arundel, Arlington, Berkeley and Charles counties.

The CDC said the weather is causing delays in the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Some states have shut down vaccination sites and testing centers.

12,"Feb 19, 2021",Philadelphia Inquirer,Texas winter storm: Power outages dwindle but water crisis lingers,"AUSTIN, Texas — Southern cities slammed by winter storms that l eft millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Busted water pipes ruptured by record-low temperatures created shortages of clean drinking water, shut down the Memphis airport on Friday and left hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.

In Texas, 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — were under orders to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at in an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Restaurants that can’t do so or don’t have bottled water were ordered to close. And water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights.

In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.

» READ MORE: After up to 10 inches of snow in the Philly area; sleet, freezing drizzle, and icy roads persisted into the night

“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.

Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a have hours after he arrived.

“We need water, the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have,” Davis said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week, forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.

Texas electrical grid operators said Friday that transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up home — buckling the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.

Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power. About 70,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 70 people, including people struggling to get warm and a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning.”

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Friday afternoon, more than 1,300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.

More than 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director, Greg Maszaros, implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”

In Dallas, David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.

“It’s pretty much first come, first served,” said Lopez, as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”

Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals, but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled, spokeswoman Gale Smith said.

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled water and bagged ice for all consumption and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building — causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skink lizard.

More than 192,000 Louisiana residents -- some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura -- had no water service Friday, according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.

In the community of Hackberry, near Lake Charles, Louisiana, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.","A man died at in an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

14,"Feb 23, 2021",WJTV,Jackson mayor responds to water outage criticism,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba held a news conference on Tuesday to give an update on the city’s response to low water pressure after last week’s winter storms.

The mayor said the water crisis was an “act of God” and not a failure of his administration or any individual. Lumumba also spoke out against what he called misinformation from Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

“We’ve done everything we could to secure tankers and was doing that before his rant. He talked about the tanker that was in South Jackson but failed to mention that it was the administration that is paying for that tanker. It is the administration that had the agreement with the tanker,” said Lumumba. “We’re leaving from council meetings distributing water to everybody across the city.”

Stokes is expected to address the mayor’s remarks during a news conference on Wednesday.

Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3. The tanker is located at 3200 Bailey Avenue, and it will be available from 11:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 23.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams said there were up to 28 water main breaks in the city. So far, 10 breaks have been repaired. He expects the water issues to be resolved by the end of the week.

Neighbors in South Jackson tend to get hit the hardest when the city has water issues. On TV Road, there is a booster station that used to be filled with water from 2014 to 2017. Now, it’s empty. Dr. Williams said it cannot be used until it reaches health standards.

“Not right now. We’re still in a compliance issue with the State Health Department, and until we can satisfy those compliance issues, we will not be able to use that booster station,” he stated.

There’s no timeframe on when the compliance issues at the booster station will be fixed.

Leaders said the volume of calls to 311 continues to overwhelm the system. They’re asking neighbors to reserve calls for visible water leaks and urgent needs for assistance. In addition to 311, neighbors can also call 601-960-1111 or 601-960-1778.

The Water Sewer Business Administration lobby will be temporarily closed starting February 23 until water is restored to the building. Customers will have multiple options to be able to pay bills.","Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3.

During a news conference Monday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the city's water system is still in the process of stabilizing itself. Pressure was near optimum levels on Sunday, but that has since fallen, Williams said.

Residents in south Jackson and some western pockets of the city still have little to no service as of Monday. Williams said he's aware people are suffering, but wanted to stress that crews are working as hard as they can to get water flowing to those areas.

""We understand the frustration, we understand the complaints,"" he said. ""We did not expect this to happen, but we're dealing with the aftermath of it.""

There is still no definitive timeline on when service will be fully restored, Williams said.

City officials could also not confirm how many residents remain without water in the city. Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said that because Jackson is on a legacy water system, it cannot pinpoint where outages are and how many customers are affected in that area.

""We only know there are outages because people call them in,"" she said.

Residents on Jackson's water system are still under a boil water advisory and are asked to conserve water when possible until full service is restored throughout the city.

Water distribution sites in Jackson

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Sunday.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.:

Forest Hill High School – 2607 Raymond Road, Jackson

Raines Elementary School – 156 N. Flag Chapel Road, Jackson

Callaway High School – 601 Beasley Road, Jackson

Provine High School – 2400 Robinson St., Jackson

New Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church – 140 Maple St., Jackson

Davis Road Park – 5901 Terry Road, Byram

Walton Elementary School – 3200 Bailey Ave., Jackson

The city is also continuing to deliver bottled water to residents who are elderly, disabled or homebound.

Although bottled water is also being offered at some locations, when that water is available varies by day.

Atoa said several city departments are involved in water pickup and delivery to sites. The heavy machinery used to move pallets of water require qualified personnel to operate, so city workers are being asked to help when possible, she said.

""The bottled water is a little bit more of a moving target compared to the non-potable water,"" Atoa said. ""That's why we're not putting out specific times, because it relies on so many different logistics.""

Bottled water was available at the New Mt. Zion, Forrest Hill High School, Provine High School and Davis Road Park locations by midday Monday. Atoa said the water will be available until supplies are gone.

On Monday, the New Orleans Pelicans basketball team announced they will be sending two shipments of bottled water to the city of Jackson. Distribution will be handled by city officials, according to the release.

From a team official: Pelicans “are donating 2 shipments of bottled water to the residents of Jackson, MS due to the ongoing water crisis. The two truckloads will be delivered within 24 hours and distribution of the cases of bottled water will be handled by the city of Jackson.” https://t.co/UOgLgb6z4Y — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) March 1, 2021

(JACKSON, MS) – The City of Jackson is issuing the following updates for Saturday, February 27, 2021, related to the ongoing water outages and recovery efforts being made as a result of recent winter weather:

WATER PRESSURE

We had a very good day on Friday, but today the City’s water distribution system struggled to maintain consistent pressure. Pressure levels fluctuated throughout the day reaching a psi in the high 70s, but failed to maintain a consistent enough pressure to allow sustainable flow throughout the city.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP. Today’s reading is up from 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

We are investigating potential causes, testing solutions and looking to see if there are any new leaks in the system. We are hoping to have a better day tomorrow and see some sustainable flows throughout the city.

Overall, progress has been made from where we were and we want to remain encouraged. We know that many have seen their water restored. However, there continues to be pockets throughout the city, particularly in South Jackson and other areas of higher elevation that continue to struggle. This will unfortunately continue to be the situation until we can get our tanks to maintain a certain level of water and pressure throughout the system to be consistent.

The City’s Water Maintenance Department has completed a number of repairs to water main breaks/leaks and continues to dwindle the list down. A comprehensive list of confirmed, unconfirmed, and repaired water main breaks/leaks is at the end of this release. Please report any water main breaks to 311.

The system-wide precautionary boil water notice is still in effect.

PLEASE CONSERVE WATER during this water outage crisis. Limit water usage to the necessities. Conserving water will allow fellow Jacksonians to get back online faster.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

WATER DISTRIBUTION

NON-POTABLE (FLUSHING) WATER will be available at the following locations on Sunday, February 28th from 9am to 2pm. Residents should bring containers.

17,"Feb 22, 2021",WSWS,"Jackson, Mississippi’s public water system collapses after winter storm’s deep freeze","City officials in Jackson, Mississippi reported late last week that water service had been knocked out indefinitely for most of the city after a devastating winter storm shut down power and froze water lines, resulting in a drop in water pressure last week.

Icy weather conditions created power outages last week for much of the South, including many areas of Texas where freezing temperatures and lack of power have resulted in dozens of deaths. Of the many cities across the Southern US devastated by freezing temperatures last week, Jackson, Mississippi’s capital and largest city with 160,000 residents, is among the worst hit.

Water main breaks constitute a major cause for concern, with Jackson experiencing 13 breaks in less than a week. Pressure drops and outages and boil water advisories were rampant across the state as the region’s old and poorly maintained infrastructure struggled to function under adverse weather conditions. Many of the city’s water mains and pipes have not been replaced in decades, with some piping being over 100 years old.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told reporters on Thursday, “We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.

“This becomes increasingly challenging due to the pandemic,” Lumumba said. He attempted to blame the outage on COVID-19 restrictions and the closure of schools, claiming, “so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.”

However, severe winter weather has caused a strain on Jackson’s infrastructure in the recent past, and it is well known that a significant investment in the city’s water system is overdue.

During a period of freezing cold temperatures in 2014-15, then Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency in an attempt to secure federal funding to update city water mains and roads. Back in 2015 it was estimated by city officials that somewhere between $750 million to $1 billion would be needed to fully replace or repair the city’s water mains and roads. Mayor Yarber filed a request for a paltry $2.5 million in repairs as the city’s water system crumbled.

“Our infrastructure is not prepared to handle this,” Lumumba admitted on Thursday. Many people have been without water since Monday. Residents have resorted to gathering snow to melt to create enough water to flush their toilets.

The city set up stations at fire houses, some schools, a mall and other sporadic locations to hand out bottles and jugs of water to people able to go out in the cold and wait, a difficult task for the region’s elderly and infirm residents.

Icy roads have prevented water treatment crews from receiving delivery of much needed chemicals to ensure the water being pumped into the city tanks is safe for use. As it stands, there remains a citywide boil water advisory, with residents who have water flowing from their taps instructed to boil their water before use to ensure potability.

As of Thursday, at least 221,000 homes across Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi were still without power. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards stated on Thursday that there were at least one million residents under a boil water advisory, as well as another 245,000 facing water outages entirely.

Betsy Sawyer, a resident of Vidalia in the northeast of Louisiana, spoke to the Associated Press (AP) about having to deal with power and water outages in her area. “We knew that the water was going to be shut off so we filled the bathtub up with water,” she explained. “Everybody’s scrambling, just doing their best.” Sawyer said she had very low water pressure and was keeping warm using the burners on her stove.

Desperate residents in Louisiana and Mississippi waited for hours in order to claim water handouts at various city government sites. “A lot of people have been giving up—they’re tired of waiting,” Paul Lee Davis told the AP, as he waited in line at a distribution site in Jackson. “I’ve been here so long, I figure I might as well wait it out. We need water. The stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have.”

Nicole Beard, a resident of Hackberry, Louisiana, told the AP how her hot water pipe burst and days later the water main burst, cutting off water to her area completely. Beard, who had to leave her home last year after it was destroyed by Hurricane Laura, explained that many in her community have still not fully recovered from that devastating storm six months ago. “People are still just struggling over here,” she said.","Water main breaks constitute a major cause for concern, with Jackson experiencing 13 breaks in less than a week.

WATER PRESSURE

Today we are maintaining pressure levels around 80 psi. We are seeing gains in our storage tanks and continue to see progress. We will have to cut back on flow overnight tonight in order to perform some maintenance. Some fluctuation in pressure may occur.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP.

Eddie Staten pushed a grocery cart nearly a mile to the Mississippi College School of Law on Sunday for one reason — to find clean water.

Staten is one of the thousands of people in Jackson who were affected by the massive water outage after two winter storms swept through Mississippi in mid-February. Nearly three weeks later, pockets of the city still have no service.

He's one of the luckier ones — his water has returned. But Staten said his pressure is low and his toilet still doesn't flush. Andsometimes when he turns the faucet on, the water comes out brown.

""We don't drink (tap water) because we don't trust it,"" Staten said. ""Everybody said it's contaminated and not to drink it.""

The latest on Jackson's water crisis: Officials say progress being made as residents still without water

Staten and others like him are the reason Jeffery Land, a Memphis, Tennessee, attorney, organized members of the Leo Bearman, Sr. American Inn of Courts — an organization of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals — to come together to bring more than 1,900 cases of bottled water to Jackson.

When the storms hit, Land said he was also under a boil water advisory, but his problems resolved after a few days. He said he's never heard of an outage lasting nearly as long as the one in Jackson and felt compelled to help.

""I saw the news story and figured I needed to do something,"" he said.

Land said after talking with others in the organization, he spoke with his father, Jeff Land, and began coordinating how to bring water to the Charles Clark American Inn of Courts in Jackson.

Jeff Land said the organization acquired the water in a matter of days and a local trucking company — Milan Supply Chain Solutions — offered to transport it.

""I sent a text to the CEO, Michael McLarty, ... and he called me three minutes later and said it's a done deal,"" he said.

Land was able to set up a distribution site in the parking lot of the Mississippi College School of Law on East Griffith Street because the college hosts the Jackson branch. Only 30 minutes after distribution started, organizers estimated 50 cars had already come through to get water.

Land isn't the only person to bring outside help to Jackson.The New Orleans Pelicans basketball team donated two truckloads of water on Monday, which were distributed by the city. The athletics department at the University of Mississippi, in partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, also hosted a water drive during its recent series of baseball games against Belmont to contribute to the cause.

District 4 Chancery Court Judge Crystal Wise Martin, who was at the site Sunday with her family to help with distribution, said it felt good to see people willing to come together to help Jackson when it needed it the most.

""I'm just so warm that people are coming out ... to help people,"" she said. ""That's what life is really all about.""

Dig Deeper: Jackson mayor pens letter to officials requesting millions in relief as water crisis unfolds

During a news conference Friday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said pressure at the plant was improving and only pockets in south Jackson were still without service. Testing of the city's well water system to see if the boil advisory can be lifted began Friday. The surface water system will be tested when pressure levels stay stable for at least 48 hours, officials said.

20,"Feb 24, 2021",WJTV,Water giveaways across Jackson,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Another day in Jackson’s water outage crisis continues to leave many with no running water, but there were many opportunities to get some bottled water, as well as water for household use.

The city of Jackson provided pallets upon pallets of bottled water at the VA Field on Officer Thomas Catchings Drive in Jackson for those that need it.

Keyshia Sanders with the city of Jackson says improvement has been made to the water plant and they hope to se the demand for water decrease.

Among those in line for water at the VA Field was Valerie Green. She says she has gone from site to site for water and this was the first location she’s been able to get some.

As a cancer survivor, this water crisis has been tough for Green. She says this experience has put her health in jeopardy but, she stayed positive knowing the city is doing the best they can.

The brother of Kappa Alpha Phi Fraternity Inc, and New Jerusalem Missionary Baptist Church on Raymond Road also held bottled water giveaways.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is a brother of Kappa Alpha Phi, and helped as well.

The city of Jackson anticipate additional bottled water deliveries and will announce drinking water distribution locations as they become available.

21,"Feb 24, 2021",ABC News,"Tanker trucks, National Guard dispatched to Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis","The water is not expected to be completely restored until the end of the week.

The governor of Mississippi said he's dispatching the National Guard and more tanker trucks to the state's capital city to help bring an end to a water crisis that emerged following severe winter storms that crippled the community's aging infrastructure.

Many residents of Jackson, a city of more than 160,000 people, have been struggling for over a week to secure enough water to handle basic needs, officials said.

As he waited in line at a local high school to get water from a tanker truck, Alfred Anderson Jr. summed up the feelings that he said many Jackson taxpayers have: ""This is pitiful and a shame.""

""We pay all this money ... and we have got to come out here, most of these people, and wait on to try to get stuff to flush your toilets and, you know, do your hygiene stuff and whatever,"" Anderson told ABC affiliate station WAPT in Jackson.

Casandra Woody, another Jackson resident waiting in the same line for water, said the situation ""is sad.""

""I'm just fed up,"" Woody told WAPT as she watched residents fill up as many containers that could fit in their vehicles.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

""We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix,"" Reeves said in a Tuesday night Twitter post. ""I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow (Wednesday). We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!""

Reeves noted that Jackson is one of many Mississippi cities still recovering from electrical and water emergencies.

Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday that water should be fully restored by the end of this week. But Williams said that as water pressure has been gradually increased a new problem has arisen -- busted water mains across the community. He said in recent days, city work crews have responded to fix at least 20 water main breaks.

""We had to buy some equipment in order to get where we are right now,"" Williams said. ""A lot of our equipment froze up because we could not get above 32 (degrees).""

The city's water treatment plant was knocked offline when back-to-back winter storms swept through the South last week bringing snow and below-freezing temperatures causing widespread power outages.

Williams said that at one point last week, pressure in the city's water system fell to 32 pounds per square inch. On Tuesday, he said the water pressure in the system was up to 67 PSI and that he hopes workers can get the pressure up to 80 to 85 PSI by the end of Wednesday.

Residents have been asked to boil their water before drinking and the city is establishing more locations where residents can go to get clean water.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has been the target of criticism from his constituents and city council members for his handling of the water crisis and for not getting the state moving fast enough to help fix the situation.

But Lumumba said the crisis was an ""act of God"" that exposed the city's crumbling infrastructure that he said has been neglected for decades.

Reeves agreed, saying at a news conference on Tuesday that the challenges to Jackson's water system ""were born over literally 30, 40, 50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.""

""That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we're going to fix in the next six to eight hours,"" Reeves said.","Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

Suneva Burkhalter said the water issues have been a challenge for her and her four children. She’s spent the past two weeks driving around the metro trying to find water necessities.

“This was a move to better ourselves. You know? This was move to better ourselves. So just coming here and having to deal with this, it gets me down,” she said.

Burkhalter moved her family from California two years ago hoping to create a better life, but the extended water outage has been a financial strain. She said her family uses nearly two cases of water a day. Burkhalter said the crisis has cost her roughly $1,000 and counting.

Burkhalter said if it was not for her mom, she does not know what she would have done. She hopes the water outage will end soon and hopes no one has to experience this again.","(WJTV) – Nearly two and a half weeks without water has been tough on many Jackson families.

There are over 20 water main breaks around the city of Jackson, causing many restaurants to have to keep their doors locked.

Since Tuesday, Broadstreet Baking Company, Bravo! Italian Kitchen, and Sal & Mookie’s | New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint have been without water.

Owner of all three restaurants, Jeff Good says, when they are able to open back up, they won’t be able to open with a full-service menu because they’ll be starting from scratch. All the food they have, has been either donated, thrown away, or spoiled.

About 3 miles away from Broadstreet Bakery, is Dumbo’s on Dulling. The owner, Paul Adair says they will be back open for business on Tuesday, Feb.23.

No, they still don’t have running water, but they found a solution. Adair bought a 275-gallon water tank. Filled it up in Madison County. Bought a pump and began pumping water into the restaurant.

Paul Adair says it’s been a bit of a financial blow with ordering Porta potty‘s, hand washing stations, the tank and trailer, but it beats not being open for weeks.

Patients are still being asked from the City of Jackson as there is still no exact timeframe as to when this water problem will be fixed, although they’re hoping it will be up and running by the end of the week.","(WJTV) – Frustration is rising in Jackson as residents and businesses continues to go without water.

Statewide, all utilities showed 28,366 energy customers were without power across the state at 4:25 p.m. Sunday, down from about 71,000 at 11 a.m. Saturday, according to data from PowerOutage.US. That included 4,304 in Hinds County, 49 in Rankin County and 229 in Madison County.

As of 4:40 p.m. Sunday, there were 10,894 Entergy customers without power, according to Entergy's power outage map, down from about 34,000 Saturday morning. Entergy services customers in 45 of Mississippi’s 82 counties.

Most Entergy electricity customers in Mississippi should have services restored by the beginning of next week, Entergy Mississippi President and CEO Haley Fisackerly said during a virtual press conference Friday.

More than 2,000 linemen and other personnel have been enlisted to help restore power in Mississippi, including workers from Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Canada.

As power is restored across the state, Fisackerly cautioned customers to slowly phase in use to avoid overloading the system. He suggested turning off major appliances ahead of power being turned back on.

""I know when those lights come back on, you're going to be ready to clean up that house and wash those dishes in your dishwasher, or wash your clothes,"" he said. ""Do that in stages. That could create problems back on the grid but also it's not good for your home to ... overload your breakers.""

29,"Feb 27, 2021",The Daily Beast,Frustrated Jackson Locals Are Nearing Two Weeks With No Water,"For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

For professional chef Enrika Williams, who lives in south Jackson with four other family members, it was a scramble when news began circulating around Valentine’s Day of an unexpected cold front where temperatures dropped into the teens.

Worried her pipes might freeze, quick-thinking Williams filled up her bathtub in case of such an event. Unfortunately for her and thousands of others, the unseasonably frigid weather caused the city’s outdated water equipment­–which can’t handle wintery conditions–to freeze and water lines to burst.

The result was dire, leading the city to issue a boil-water advisory and set up distribution sites for flushing water and bottled drinking water, with hundreds waiting in line with empty buckets for hours.

Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home. She bought water wherever she could, shelling out $100 on bottled water to cook and clean with.

Nearby family members who happened to have water opened up their home so Williams, her mother, two siblings, and niece could wash their clothes and take a shower.

For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

While Williams finally has water again, albeit trickling, she voiced her dissatisfaction with the city’s everchanging timeframe of when the water would be running again.

“The thing that became frustrating was the tone of accountability just wasn’t there,” Williams told The Daily Beast. “There was no plan that we could see. The press conferences were redundant. If you don’t know when it’s coming back, what is being done to help us?”

“There wasn’t anyone at the forefront who gave a damn, so to speak,” she added. “It makes you feel a lot of things. You just expect better.”

In Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new. Six years ago the city approved a 1 percent sales tax increase with the goal of updating all of its aging infrastructure, but the $15 million it generates annually is only a fraction of the $2 billion Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the city will need. Long before the current crisis hit, one popular local t-shirt read “Welcome to Boil Water Alert, Mississippi.”

What’s different this time, residents say, is the sheer scale—the entire city is either without water or under a boil water alert.

“ It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives. ” — Laurie Bertram Roberts

More than a few residents have noted that the crisis has hit south and west Jackson hardest while leaving northeast Jackson, the one predominantly white corner of this 80 percent Black capital city, relatively unscathed. Over the past several days, Laurie Bertram Roberts, who runs the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, has used the fund to distribute more than 130 cases of water to residents, with plans to deliver another 80 tomorrow.

“Part of the problem is that it’s everywhere,” Roberts said. “Usually when we have an outage it’s in one neighborhood, so people are used to running over to their friends’ house or their auntie’s house to take a shower or fill up some jugs. Usually, you can grab your buckets and find some place to fill them, whatever. But when it’s the whole damn city? Where are the Black people supposed to go? It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives.”

Jackson, which has a population of around 160,000, has a 26.9 percent poverty rate. Williams explained that a lot of people don’t have the resources to go out and buy additional water to cook and bathe with.

“People can’t afford that,” she said. “Water is a basic necessity and it just brought a lot of frustration, anger, and disappointment.”

“We aren’t out of the woods yet. There’s still a lot of people without water.”

While Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday night that he would “restore clean water” and send in the National Guard and tanker trucks with non-potable water in effort to relieve the issue, conditions still hadn’t improved by Saturday.

Fed-up locals flooded the city’s Facebook page to demand answers.

“Day 12 and not even a drip at my house,” Dwight Pugh wrote. “NEVER have we had disrupted this long.”

“It’s clear that the city government doesn’t have the resources or the ability to manage things, and they’re getting worse, rather than better,” John Zer added.

“It’s been two weeks and I know families with infants who don’t have water. The city needs help,” Jamario Townsend chimed in. “I’m thankful my water is trickling out enough to flush my toilet but dang. This just needs to be fixed at this point. It just needs to be fixed.”

Many directed their anger towards Democratic Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who had pleaded with his constituents to have “patience” while admitting there was “no definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.”

“ This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents. ” — Mayor Chokwe Lumumba

Accused of being too slow to reach out to Reeves for assistance, Lumumba claimed the Republican governor wouldn’t return any of his phone calls. Reeves’ camp quickly fired back that the governor had no missed calls from Lumumba.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, “The challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different. This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents.”

“Our systems were never meant to endure days of ice storms and sub-zero temperatures coupled by road conditions that prevented the delivery of critical supplies,” he added. “It has been a difficult few weeks. Our recovery efforts continue. We are not there yet, but we are doing everything we can to restore water to Jackson residents.”

Reeves seems to agree, saying earlier in the week that Jackson’s water systems problems date back to “50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.”

“That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we’re going to fix in the next six to eight hours,” he added.","For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

30,1 month ago,WBUR,"The Jackson, Mississippi Water Crisis And America's Crumbling Water System","""And the city itself, because, like so many cities in the U.S., because of flight, and disinvestment and losing the tax base. And in this case, losing 40,000 residents, taking us from 200,000 to 160,000. But we still have a huge land mass of city with these outdated pipes under them. So we can't pay, we can't afford to keep it up. ... It's a systemic breakdown of federal, state and local municipal areas being able to work together to solve problems together on basic things like infrastructure.""

Donna Ladd : “To use words that my reporter Nick Judin used, it's a complex system collapse. And when we say that, it's not just the technological part of the system. It's the fact that we've known this for years, it's coming in one way or another. I mean, we know it. There was a big 2013 study that warned about all of these things. So we know the conditions of them. But there's a systemic breakdown in the willingness to actually do something about it.

For a month, residents of Jackson, Mississippi went without clean running water. The city's mayor says the problem's decades in the making. That makes Jackson a lesson for the entire country. We talk America's crumbling water system.

What has the city of Jackson done over the past couple of decades to attend to this known problem?

Donna Ladd: “I think the best way to break it down is to say staunching the bleeding, Band-Aid approach as far as the city itself is concerned. I mean, I can't ... sit here and blame a city that is as beleaguered as our city has been for not having the resources to be able to overhaul the water system.

""Some of the numbers that we've come up with, the least amount that they need is $600 million. And then, as you said earlier, it keeps climbing from there. I mean, if the money's not here, the money's not here. So what that means is that the state should be at the same table with the city, side by side. This is the capital city.

“You know, the state is no stronger than its capital city. That's absurd. And so they should be side by side with the city saying, OK, how are we going to work together to get federal help? What is it that we can do? How can we help? But the opposite happens. You know, one of the things our governor said just recently was, Well, you know, Jackson residents should pay their water bill, so they should go collect the water bill.

""Well, there's a whole issue around faulty billing that we've been through. But beyond that, it's like the city tried to get the state, and the state legislature passed legislation to allow payment plans for the water bill. And the governor vetoed it last year. And so that's like working against us, and so the money doesn't come in. But the water billing money is not enough to pay for what we're talking about here.

""And we have to work with the federal government, as we've discovered. A lot of the disinvestment and helping municipal areas across the country came during the '80s and particularly the Reagan era. Which was kind of pulling back on financial assistance, for environmental improvements, those kinds of things. And that is one of those perfect storm moments where it got so much worse afterwards as far as not being able to pay for things. And so when you've got everybody working against each other, or ignoring each other, then it's a terrible situation.""

We keep using this phrase 'crumbling.' Is that a fair description of some of these water systems?

Aaron Packman: ""Most of the infrastructure we have in the eastern half of the United States is quite old. Just for point of comparison, I live in Chicago. We're still using the water intakes from Lake Michigan that were built in the 1960s. And in places like Philadelphia, the water infrastructure goes back 300 years. So clearly infrastructure that age needs a lot of maintenance to work properly. And it's very hard to do, because most of the pipes are underground and inaccessible. So we definitely have an issue with its aging, deteriorating water infrastructure in a lot of the country.”

Where should early targets be for the federal government if it's going to pump a whole lot of money into infrastructure?

Catherine Coleman-Flowers: “First of all, those people that never got the infrastructure should get it first. So, I mean, in this conversation we were talking about municipalities when most of the United States is rural. And most of them are not in municipalities. So should they still be denied access to infrastructure, especially water and wastewater infrastructure? And we're seeing in some places, I'm actually doing a project right now with The Guardian where we are documenting wastewater problems throughout the United States, it's not just a one situation. It's not just Jackson, Mississippi. It's not just even Detroit, which is having a lot of issues and water shut offs.

""And if we shut off the water, you shut off sanitation. And I think the other thing that we have to do is make sure that the policy makers, if we're going to have solutions, we cannot separate wastewater from water. Because a lot of people in their mind, because they can flush the toilets, they assume that everybody else in the U.S. can do the same thing. That's the reason why we were able to do a study to show that there was hookworm in Lowndes County. And it's probably in other areas, too. We just haven't looked for it yet. So that's the first thing we need to do, give it to places that don't have it.

""We also need to identify where those places are. There are no accurate numbers on how many people do not have wastewater sanitation, because that was taken off the census in the 1990s. So if we're going to make decisions based on what numbers we have, we're still going to leave a lot of people behind. And a lot of these people are in rural communities, or they are poor people or people of color. And we have to unpack and unfold that.

""And I think we can't talk about infrastructure, and where the dollars are going or where they have gone, unless we deal with the social justice issues around those decisions. Because to people who are not like me, they see it just as simply a political decision. But socially, it has an impact on people that look like me. And we need to make sure that our voices are heard and that part of the solution is getting those dollars to those communities that have been left behind.”

Aaron Packman: ""This is a rare opportunity, because you don't usually have these problems get elevated to the presidential level and a commitment to make an investment. So I would advocate for modernization of our wastewater treatment facilities, a lot of which used 50-year-old plus technology. And also fixing some of the hard problems with the water distribution system and also the wastewater system, the things that are less accessible, that often get ignored and are not fully maintained. So this will be expensive, but it will make a big difference.""

31,"Mar 18, 2021",MSNBC News,Without Water in Jackson,"About this episode:

It’s been a month since an historic winter storm hit Jackson, Mississippi, leaving tens of thousands of residents without clean water, or without any water at all. Most of those residents were Black. Four weeks later, much of the capital city still has to boil water to drink.

Eighty-two percent of the residents in Jackson are Black and nearly a third live in poverty. Over the past several decades, the city has not had enough money to fix its dilapidated water system.

State lawmakers, whose leadership has always been white, are debating how to address the water crisis before the end of the legislative session in just a few weeks; historically, state leaders have insisted that Jackson’s water problems are the city’s fault, and the city’s to fix.

Many residents, including Jackson’s mayor, say race and racism play a big part in the struggle over the decades-long water crisis in Jackson. If the city were majority-white, they say, this problem would have been fixed a long time ago.

Host Trymaine Lee speaks with West Jackson resident Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable and an advocate for Black women and girls in the state.

And Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba discusses the problem from his vantage point as the man in charge of the water crisis and the chief advocate for more money from the state to fix the crumbling system.

Interstate, highway closures and advisories

Authorities are warning against any travel unless necessary and road conditions remain dangerous. The following closures and advisories are in place as of 7 a.m. Wednesday.

Closure: I-2

Thousands remain without power

The number of pawer outages across the state is declining, but thousands are still without. As of 6 a.m. Wednesday, roughly 18,700 customers were without power. On Monday, Poweroutage.us reported about 55,000 customers were without power.

The hardest-hit counties lie in a northeasterly line from Pike County to Kemper County. Counties in the northwestern part of the state have experienced significant numbers of outages as well during the storm.

Some state health departments, vaccine sites closed Wednesday

The Mississippi State Department of Health has announced that only a few county health departments, WIC centers and offices in south Mississippi will be open Wednesday as wintry weather continues in the state.

Locations will be open in the following counties:

Forrest

George

Greene

Hancock

Harrison

Jackson

Jones

Lamar

Pearl River

Perry

Stone

Wayne

In addition, most of the state's drive-thru COVID-19 vaccination sites will also be closed Wednesday, except for those in Harrison, Jackson, Forrest and Jones counties. Anyone with an appointment at other sites will have their shot automatically rescheduled. The health department will contact affected residents by phone, text or email.

City of Jackson offices remain closed, trash collection suspended Wednesday

The city of Jackson has announced all administrative offices will remain closed Wednesday due to inclement weather. All employees who have been working remotely will continue to do so.

Trash collection throughout central Mississippi will also be suspended Wednesday. Waste management officials said service will resume when roadways are deemed safe to travel.

EB I-20 in Rankin County closed due to disabled vehicles

The Mississippi Department of Transportation is warning drivers to avoid eastbound Interstate 20 in Rankin County near the Pearson Road exit due to disabled vehicles.

Officials from the department said the closure will be in place until further notice.

Road crews have been working since late Monday night to treat highways in the area. But there have been several accidents in the region and roads in several areas have been closed due to poor conditions.

Road conditions are expected to worsen due to a new storm system expected Wednesday.

City of Jackson issues boil water advisory

The city of Jackson has issued a boil water advisory until further notice for roughly 43,000 customers after freezing temperatures have affected water production.

According to a news release issued Tuesday afternoon, the record cold temperatures that have gripped the region have affected equipment at the city's water treatment plants and they can no longer maintain adequate water pressure. Some residents may experience low to no pressure when using faucets or appliances until the issue is resolved.

The city advises that all water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute before use for the following:

cooking or baking

making ice cubes

taking medication

brushing teeth

washing food

mixing baby formula or food

mixing juices or drinks

feeding pets

washing dishes

City officials said residents will be notified when the boil advisory has been lifted.

Water main breaks

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams has said the city is preparing for an expected high volume of water main breaks. He encouraged the public to report any water main breaks or low water pressure by calling 311.

Hazardous travel conditions expected for days in Mississippi

Hazardous travel conditions have been an issue since the winter storm moved in on Sunday and according to the Mississippi Department of Transportation, conditions won't improve much for days to come.

""We are treating right now, as much as we can, all of our interstates,"" Jas N. Smith, MDOT deputy director of Public Affairs, said Tuesday. ""We're using salt and snow plows to clear the roads.""

But even with salt, snow plows and crews working 12-hour shifts, the department can't get ahead of what it's being dealt.

""We're expecting another wave of winter weather with subfreezing temperatures and possibly frozen precipitation,"" Smith said. ""We could see roads refreezing and possibly covered with ice again.

""It's a pretty unprecedented event. We have Mother Nature working against us. We'll be starting all over again.""

Weather-related incidents mounting, MHP says

Roads and bridges across most of Mississippi are covered in ice and snow, creating a dangerous situation for motorists and leaving some roads impassible.

According to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, state troopers have worked 695 weather-related calls between Sunday and 6 a.m. Tuesday morning.

As of 2/16, 6AM CST, MHP has responded to 695 WX related service calls since the #WinterStorm2021 event began on 2/14 #CourtesyServiceSafety#VirtuteEtArmispic.twitter.com/O7VQRqAxyQ — MS Highway Patrol (@MSHwyPatrol) February 16, 2021

Jackson airport closures extended

The city of Jackson officially lifted its boil water advisory Monday morning after a fire at one of the city's water treatment plants shut it down just months after an outage left residents without water for weeks.

The city had been under a notice since Friday when an electrical fire at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility knocked out power to the plant. The fire shut off power to two of the plant's pumps.

Residents across the city were without water for several hours before work crews were able to restore power and replenish the tanks.

City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said in an email on Sunday that the city has delivered two consecutive days of water samples to the health department.

The notice applies to about 43,000 customers on the city's surface water system.

38,"Mar 24, 2021",Mississippi Today,Why Jackson’s water system is broken,"Janna Avalon, a 72-year-old retired newspaper editor, lived out the mid-February ice storm and weeks-long water outage just feet from South Jackson’s empty water tower.

The one million-gallon tank, one of several across the city, is meant to store water at a high elevation, utilizing gravity to pressurize the delivery system, especially during service interruptions.

But contingency plans are a myth in a system as chronically broken as Jackson’s.

So for the better part of the last month, Avalon and her husband Billy heaved buckets of water they retrieved from government tankers, kind neighbors or rainfall into their home to flush their toilet or wash dishes.

Most Jacksonians lost running water altogether after back-to-back winter storms the week of Feb. 14 stunned unprepared utilities across the Deep South, and the Avalons were some of the roughly 43,000 people whose taps remained dry for more than two weeks. City officials were still telling most residents, 82% of whom are Black, to boil their water a month later.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government … when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered, it’s a profound betrayal of trust.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

In the Avalons’ spacious backyard — beyond a wooden playset, garden and plum trees, plastic flamingos and decorative stone statues — the water tower adds its own charm. Avalon said it reflects colors in the evening sky, prolonging sunsets.

“It’s got all these great little attributes,” Avalon said, “except water.”

Avalon grew up in Jackson and has lived in her home, where she raised her five children, for 28 years. Despite ongoing utility hiccups, she’s intent on staying. She asks why she should have to move — and contribute to the city’s population decline of 20% since 1980 — to access basic human services. Why city and state government officials can’t or won’t improve conditions where she already lives. Why her water bills are unreliable, why nobody reads her water meter, and why there is a “huge city water tower in our backyard and there’s no water in it.”

The questions seem simple, but the answers are complex, and the dysfunction is causing a rift between Jacksonians and their leaders.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government,” said Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. “It comes into your house. You take it into your body. We put our children in it, and we prepare food with it. And when that fails — when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered — it’s a profound betrayal of trust. And it shakes you to your core.”

Many Jacksonians lacked access to clean drinking water long before the most recent storm. In fact, on a good day, officials advise pregnant people and children under five not to drink from the tap, a phenomenon that’s been the case for the last five years.

“And most people in Jackson don’t even know,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, told Mississippi Today during the recent outage. “The city and the state have done nothing to provide water to those populations. This whole time they should have been providing water for pregnant people and children under five. This whole time.”

And yet, when Jackson water customers do receive a bill (because consistent and accurate billing has also been a problem), they’re sometimes paying exorbitant amounts for water that’s unsafe to drink.

Every city water bill notifies customers of the hazard of high lead levels first found in Jackson’s tap water in 2016, caused by recurring faulty water treatment techniques that remain unaddressed.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city’s water system presented “imminent and substantial endangerment” to its customers and could contain E. Coli.

Water outages and the presence of harmful contaminants when the water does reach the tap are two different scenarios with unique sets of threats, but they both stem from decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance within a dysfunctional and outdated water treatment and delivery system.

And the risks of scarce or dirty water exist more often in the homes of families who are already burdened by the ongoing pandemic, low wages, stagnant wealth, a lack of quality health care and racism.

The city is faced with two colliding but distinct funding problems: One, the city’s infrastructure is only getting older and past administrations did not plan for inevitable future capital investments, as is true in many aging cities. Two, the loss of customer base and pervasive billing troubles have left the water department without a feasible revenue model for regular operations and maintenance.

“This is like a triple or quadruple whammy, what’s going on,” said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at D.C.-based Center for Community Progress. “One layer is the fact that older cities — completely leaving aside race, poverty, all that — are at a disadvantage to young cities.”

“Then you get the second layer,” Mallach continued. “You have this whole phenomenon which has been going on really since the 1950s, where older cities, central cities, have essentially been abandoned by large parts of the middle class, especially the white middle class, for the suburbs.”

Winter storms in past years — 1989, 1994, 2010, 2014 and most recently 2018 — have tested the city’s outdated water delivery system and caused widespread water main breaks and outages. Each time, the city has scrambled to make band-aid repairs, only to wait until the next catastrophe. Jackson isn’t alone in taking this approach, said Teodoro, the Wisconsin professor.

“The nature of local politics is that city governments will tend to neglect utilities until they break because they’re literally buried,” he said. “One of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe. But the price is very easy for them to observe.”

Not even EPA orders — including a decade-old consent decree over the city’s wastewater system that continues to release raw sewage into the Pearl River — have resulted in much meaningful action. City water and sewer systems are not like corporations, Teodoro said; the authorities can’t just take their license away. And imposing large fines only punishes the taxpayers they are supposed to be protecting. “In the end, there’s very little you can do,” Teodoro said of regulators.

“They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund

This year, Jackson officials said, issues were particularly pronounced at the water treatment plants, which are not enclosed and protected from the elements like plants typically are up north.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams told the media that the screens through which water from the reservoir is filtered had frozen, rendering the plant incapable of taking in water, causing pressure to drop across the system. Operators didn’t discover the issue until the weekend after the storms. They also encountered malfunctioning raw water pumps.

Also, the 10 million gallon basins where filtered reservoir water is stored before it is chemically treated contained two feet of sludge due to an overdose in chemicals that occured over time when water wasn’t coming in — a possible human error, Williams said. The city took two basins offline to clean them the week after the storm and cleaned the third a couple weeks later.

In addition to needed equipment upgrades, the city is sorely lacking the personnel needed to operate the plant in its current condition. City officials rely on these operators to notify them of an event, such as sludge build up, that they need to address. Jackson employs three high-level operators at each of its water treatment plants, when each facility really needs six of these top officials, Williams told Mississippi Today. In 2018, there were 60 unfilled positions in Public Works, Clarion Ledger reported.

“You have to maintain what you have until you’re able to make improvements,” Williams said. “But once again, you have to have funding.”

Two generations of white and wealth flight out of Jackson has reduced the built-in revenue that officials say the water system needs just to maintain full operations, including hiring personnel — let alone to make a dent in an estimated $1 billion worth of needed upgrades.

The city’s bungled attempt to revamp its water meter and billing system through a $90 million contract with German-based manufacturer Siemens only worsened the water department’s cash flow — not to mention public confidence — while any outside investment in the capital city has come at a crawl.

“And we all know why,” Roberts, the activist, said. “Nobody wants to invest in Jackson because of who runs Jackson and who lives in Jackson. Because white folks don’t dominate here anymore. They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.”

With a population that’s 82% African American, Jackson is the single Blackest large city in the nation. Roughly 1-in-4 residents live in poverty, and in some west and south Jackson communities, the hardest hit by water outages, the average household pulls an income of $25,000 and as low as $15,000 in some pockets.

The capital city has lost roughly 40,000 residents since the population peaked at about 200,000 in 1980, after an initial wave of white residents left to avoid putting their children in integrated schools. Half of the decline occurred in the last two decades as more middle-class Black families moved, and the city’s white population continued to drop from 52% in 1980 to 28% in 2000 to 17% in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

As the customer base declines, the system might clean and pump out less water, but the same infrastructure remains under the surface of Jackson’s 111 square miles, an area geographically larger than Seattle, Baltimore or Cincinnati. Parts of Jackson’s 1,500 miles of water mains are over 100 years old.

Of course, pipes under streets in front of abandoned properties — about 4,000 by one 2019 count — still require maintenance.

At the same time, family resources are diminishing with inflation. Household buying power fell just slightly in the 1980s and was relatively stable through the 1990s. But since 2000, the annual median household income in Jackson has dropped about $6,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars, a roughly 15% decrease, according to a Mississippi Today analysis of Census data.

“We are a city with very high levels of poverty, and it’s difficult for us to raise the rates enough to do large scale replacement type projects and not make it unaffordable to live in the city of Jackson,” said former city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

Yet the cost of Jackson’s poor quality water is still passed on to families who don’t trust the tap and purchase bottled water — which can cost a family of four $50-$100 a month — to drink instead.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

The city raised water rates in 2013, but the Siemens deal penned the same year came with an onslaught of problems, including the installation of faulty water meters and meters that measured water in gallons instead of the correct cubic feet. This made any benefits of the rate increase virtually impossible to see.

The results have been nonsensical. Over the past several years, the city has mailed exorbitant bills to some customers and none to others. Sometimes, the charges weren’t based on how much water a household used and other times, city officials advised residents to “pay what they think they owe.” Past officials said the city lacked the manpower and expertise in the billing department to manually rectify the account issues with any speed.

In trying to protect people during the persistent billing blunders, the city has at times instituted no-shutoff policies, which demonstrate compassion but haven’t helped to compel payment.

Today, more than 8,000 customers, or nearly one-sixth of the city’s customer base, still aren’t receiving bills. Nearly 16,000 customers owe more than $100 or are more than 90 days past due, a city spokesperson told Mississippi Today. Jackson water customers owe a total of $90.3 million.

As a result, the city continues to miss out on tens of millions of water revenues. In 2016, when officials first uncovered the issue, the city’s actual water sewer collections during the previous year was a startling 32% less than projected — a roughly $26 million shortfall.

It’s a vicious cycle: revenue shortfalls make it harder for the city to purchase upgrades or hire the personnel needed to properly manage the billing system; the billing inaccuracies and sloppy accounting encourage a culture of nonpayment; the unpaid bills just further tank the revenue.

Frustration only grows as residents are expected to pay for subpar service within a utility that’s already largely taken for granted.

The city received just under $60 million out of last year’s $90 million Siemens settlement, about $33 million of which is restricted in reserves or bond covenants. Another $12.6 million went to repay the general fund, leaving about $14 million for emergency sewer repairs and a new billing system.

Lawyers got the rest — a little more than $30 million.

The story of Jackson’s failing infrastructure, national experts say, could just as easily describe the scenario in other major cities like Detroit, Toledo or Kansas City, whose leaders have had to look outside their own budgets to solve major crises.

A city rests within a state, after all, and decisions made at the state level and the impact those decisions have on the economy and public services affect what a city is able to accomplish.

“It’s really disingenuous to look at the politics and policies of any one American city in isolation from the state context in which it exists,” Teodoro said.

The residents who left Jackson in the late 20th century fled to surrounding suburbs such as Rankin County, the wealthier Republican bastion that produced many of Mississippi’s most powerful politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves.

Less than a year ago, Reeves vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided relief to poor Jacksonians with past due water bills and propped up the city’s bond rating, a proposal he suggested perpetuated a “‘free money’ concept,” Clarion Ledger reported.

A similar bill, which would apply to all municipalities, is making its way through the Legislature this session. Lawmakers also killed a bill to assist Jackson with infrastructure bonds, but it still has a chance to pass legislation that would allow the city to propose its own sales tax increase to pay for water system improvements.

Meanwhile, Speaker Philip Gunn, another top lawmaker who lives in a Jackson suburb, spent the session trying to pass tax reform that would have actually increased the tax burden on the bottom 60% of the state’s income earners, according to one study, while significantly cutting the taxes of the richest residents.

The city is also still fighting the state’s 2016 attempt to wrest control of Jackson’s airport. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during a recent mayoral debate that during a conversation with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the state Senate leader who lives in the white pocket of northeast Jackson, the lieutenant governor asked the mayor to “give me my airport” in exchange for infrastructure funding.

This ongoing tension is the backdrop for the city’s current crisis.

Academics who have studied government water systems recommend they regionalize in order to spread costs among struggling cities and more affluent suburbs. There’s just one recurring hitch to securing such an agreement: “Racism makes all of this so much harder,” Teodoro said.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.”

The history of racial conflict, Teodoro explained, creates a scenario where Black residents of the city fear losing control of their services to the same people who have systematically oppressed them. And white residents of the suburbs, who chalk the city’s problems up to incompetence, don’t feel responsible to help.

In the Jackson metro, not only is regionalization a tough sell, there are examples of the opposite happening. West Rankin Utility Authority recently splintered off to build its own wastewater treatment facility to become independent from Jackson’s Savannah Street Wastewater Treatment Plant.

It’s twofold: Systemic racism is an unmistakable underlying cause for Jackson’s stripped resources, and while it may be clouded by a mutual distrust today, racism continues to prevent future investment.

For Avalon, a white woman, understanding the decline of her majority-Black community is as easy as pointing to the state’s refusal to fully fund education or expand Medicaid.

“Racism is everywhere,” Avalon said. “We need to recognize what we’re talking about. If my kid goes to public school that’s not up to par, why? We’re all paying taxes.”

The storage tank on Avalon’s street wasn’t full of water, Williams explained, because as the system loses pressure on an ongoing basis, not just during storms, the tower is constantly drained to make up for the deficiencies. He said he didn’t know if that tank had ever been full.

South Jackson often bears the brunt of water crises because the area is one of the furthest away from the treatment plant, so water takes longer to travel there. What little water would have been inside the tower at the time of the storm was used up immediately by some of the roughly 70,000 people who live in South Jackson.

That’s a convenient explanation for Avalon, who says her community is always last to receive attention on a variety of issues. “We’ve been putting up with that stuff all my life in south Jackson,” she said.

Jackson City Councilman De’Keither Stamps pushed the council to ask the state for $60 million, in addition to an initial $47 million proposal, to build new water storage towers in South Jackson and Byram to build up capacity in those areas.

“You shouldn’t have to live your life in fear of the plant going down,” Stamps said. “You should have enough capacity within a short distance from your house to maintain yourself.”

On March 1, just as water was starting to trickle out of her tap, Avalon stood on her back porch as it rained and looked out at the empty water reservoir that engulfs the skyline. City contractors had just come out a few years ago to repaint its dingy exterior, she recalled. Some 100 feet up, a large black fowl crouched on top of the massive steel structure stamped with the City of Jackson seal.

“If they’re vultures, gosh, that’s a terrible omen,” she said with a chuckle.

Water pressure in the Avalon home fell again in the following days as city officials discovered the facility’s intake filters were clogged with clams, mussels, tree branches and other items and had to take the systems offline. The Avalons had to shut off their water again the following weekend because of a broken pipe on their property. They’ll expect outages to continue.

“It keeps coming back and slapping us in the face, and we can’t do anything about it,” Avalon said.

Days after an uncharacteristic freeze saw snow pile up and ice cover roads across the Mid-South, multiple regions were grappling with the dangerous and, at times, deadly results of Sunday's storm — while bracing for additional precipitation the National Weather Service expected to accumulate in some areas by Thursday morning.

Louisiana and Mississippi were contending with power outages and electricity shortages, with residents in both states bearing the added burden of water utility issues.

Tennessee's two largest cities hadn't been dealt a similar level of power problems, though like Louisiana, the state has record weather-related deaths.

For select portions of Mid-South states, in the southern parts of Alabama and Louisiana, the extreme weather had relented. Or, the precipitation had at least paused, as was the case in northwest Arkansas. Elsewhere in the Mid-South, though, residents largely awaited the third round of winter weather expected to commence Wednesday.

Mississippi

From power outages and boil notices to expected water main breaks and highway closures, central Mississippi residents were contending with a host of storm-related issues — while bracing for additional freezing rain and sleet predicted through Thursday morning.

Closures included the majority of the state's vaccination sites, large stretches of interstates and highways and the Jackson airport. Drivers were urged to stay off roadways and only travel when absolutely necessary. Officials expected roads to remain hazardous until the weekend, as sub-freezing temperatures prevent ice melt or cause melted precipitation to refreeze into black ice along roads and bridges.

By early Wednesday morning, roughly 18,700 customers were without power in Mississippi, according to Poweroutage.us. The hardest-hit counties lie in a northeasterly line from Pike County to Kemper County. Counties in the northwestern part of the state have experienced significant numbers of outages as well during the storm.

In Jackson, nearly 43,000 water customers were under a boil water advisory after equipment at the city's water treatment plants was affected by the record cold, according to a press release. The city was also preparing for an expected high volume of water main breaks according to Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams.

A sudden heavy bout of snow and frozen rain makes visibility low on MS Hwy. 463 in Madison, Miss., with temperatures barely hovering at 20 degrees Fahrenheit Monday morning, Feb. 15, 2021. According to the National Weather Service in Jackson, Miss., a winter storm warning continues for all counties. Mississippi Emergency Management Agency warns almost all of the state is expected to endure temperatures below 10 degrees Tuesday morning except in parts of the southeast.

West and Middle Tennessee

In West Tennessee, three Shelby County deaths that could have been caused by hypothermia were under investigation as the Memphis area braced for more snow Wednesday. Vaccination sites in the county are closed through Saturday. Amid the dangerous conditions schools, area schools have either closed or are holding classes virtually.

In Middle Tennessee, the bulk of the snow was expected overnight, said NWS Meteorologist Caroline Adcock.

""We're definitely going to get a dump late Wednesday night,"" Adcock said. Travel, she said, may become difficult on Thursday.

Three to four inches of snow were possible in Nashville and two to three inches were expected in other areas including Clarksville and Columbia.

Meteorologists don't expect snow to start melting in middle Tennessee until the weekend.

Alabama

Northwest Alabama remained under the National Weather Service's winter storm warning until Thursday morning. ""Snow and sleet accumulations up to 2 inches with locally higher amounts and freezing rain accumulations up to a tenth of an inch will be possible,"" the NWS Birmingham office cautioned residents of northwest counties.

But ""little impact"" from the ongoing storm was expected elsewhere in the state Wednesday, according to the NWS. High temperatures in the 40s were expected near Tuscaloosa and in the 50s near Montgomery, where the sun is back out for residents, with a chance of rain, rather than snow, later in the day.

Arkansas

Snowfall had also largely subsided in the northwest corner of Arkansas as of Wednesday. But between two to eight inches of snow was expected elsewhere across the state by Thursday morning, with the Little Rock region hit heaviest. Residents of eastern Arkansas, near Memphis, could expect between three to six inches, according to the NWS forecast.

Even without additional snowfall, where temperatures remain below freezing, vigilance is still required, said meteorologist Joe Sellers. ""The roads are still snow-covered, snow-packed, so they're going to be slick.""

Blowing snow makes for dangerous travel and buildings burdened by the weight of too much snow can be compromised, the NWS Little Rock office wrote in a winter storm advisory Wednesday effect throughout the state until Thursday.

Louisiana

As a ""last resort"" effort ahead of a second freeze predicted to hit northern Louisiana Wednesday, power grids in the state instituted rolling blackouts in an effort to lessen electricity shortages.

Gov. John Bel Edwards said he briefed President Joe Biden on Louisiana's weather emergency Tuesday.

""I spoke with President Biden about our ongoing challenges in Louisiana because of this severe weather, including my concerns about Louisianans facing power outages in such cold temperatures.""

In Shreveport, the winter storm forced the closure of City Court and the cancellation of elective procedures at hospitals in the area, where the chance of snow and sleet is 100% — though it may amount to less than an inch. Although a high near 29 is expected, wind chill values will be as low as 10.

All Bossier schools and centers will remain closed for the rest of the week, including virtual classes.

Later in the day, some central Louisiana customers were told they'd need to boil their water because of low pressure plaguing the system.

40,3 weeks ago,CBS News,"Race, politics, and the crumbling water infrastructure in Mississippi's capital city","Last February, as back-to-back winter storms buried the deep south in snow and ice, some residents in Jackson, Mississippi, found themselves facing an additional hardship. They had no water running water for weeks.

Ronnie Crudup, a bishop at New Horizon Church in the city, said he was without water for 18 days.

""This [winter storm] was one of the worst in the central part of Mississippi, we don't get a lot of cold weather, and so that made us very, very susceptible,"" Crudup told 60 Minutes+ correspondent Wesley Lowery. ""I had never experienced a point where I saw no water come out of the pipes.""

But even without the winter weather, Crudup said, the city's water infrastructure constantly fails its residents.

""If you drive through the city, you're going to see all this water coming up… because the infrastructure is old and decrepit,"" Crudup said. ""It has not been maintained well.""

60 Minutes+'s Lowery reports this week on the confluence of race and politics underlying Jackson's deteriorating water system, which is badly in need of an overhaul.

""White flight"" in the 70s and 80s created a vicious cycle that saw businesses close in Jackson, prompting cuts in city services due to a lack of tax revenue. Over that time, Jackson went from being 60% White to nearly 60% Black. Now, more than 80% of the city's 160,000 inhabitants are Black.

State officials have developed a reportedly rocky relationship with the city, leading to a lack of investment from the state legislature. Bishop Ronnie Crudup thinks that the city's new racial makeup is likely a factor in its strained relationship with the state.

""You would want your capital city hopefully to be a shining star. You know, sometimes the State and the city legislation and all those folks, they're anti-Jackson, okay?"" Crudup said. ""Once Jackson became predominantly Black, it had Black leadership-- then it seemed to be a level of tension between the state government and Jackson that may not have been there, okay? That may not be true, but that's sure how I and a number of other folks perceive it….""

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who at 34 was elected the youngest leader in city history, seemed to agree.

""I think that we would be less than honest with ourselves if we did not… just directly confront the issues of race that we have in Mississippi and in the United States,"" Lumumba said.

Meanwhile, city residents are forced to deal with water outages and advisories to boil their water before cooking, washing their hands or brushing their teeth. The city's public works department can't keep up with the leaks across the city's hundreds of miles of pipes that are, in some cases, brittle to the touch.

41,"Feb 20, 2021",NBC News,President Biden declares major disaster for much of Texas following severe winter storm,"President Joe Biden declared a major disaster for much of Texas as the state reels from a severe winter storm that left millions of people without power amid freezing temperatures.

Biden's action makes federal funding available to communities across 77 counties, including hard-hit Harris County, where Houston is located. Additional disaster designations may be made after further damage assessments, the White House said Saturday morning in a statement.

“I thank President Biden for his assistance as we respond to impacts of winter weather across our state,” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement. “While this partial approval is an important first step, Texas will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure all eligible Texans have access to the relief they need.”

Chief Nim Kidd of the Texas Division of Emergency Management said Saturday afternoon that the state's goal is to eventually add all 254 counties under the major disaster declaration.

""Most Texans do not winterize their homes. It would be counterproductive in the hot months that we have, so we know there are a lot of broken pipes out there,"" Kidd said during a press conference, adding that bottled water distribution is currently a key priority.

Out of more than 295,000 outages in the United States on Saturday, Texas accounted for more than 20 percent of them with 60,074 outages, according to the tracking site poweroutage.us.

At least two lawsuits have already been filed against the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees 90 percent of the state’s electricity, in an attempt to hold the power grid operator accountable for catastrophic outages this week.

The latest lawsuit, which was filed Friday in Nueces County, blames ERCOT for ignoring decades-old safety warnings, among other failures, the Dallas Morning News reported. It's likely that the case will test ERCOT’s claim to sovereign immunity, a legal shield that guards government entities from claims. The protection is currently under review by the Texas Supreme Court.

The latest on the storm:

Boil water notices remain in effect across 189 counties after more than 1,300 public water systems have reported disruptions in service due to the weather, affecting more than 15.1 million people, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality said in a statement Saturday.

At least 22 people in Texas have died in connection to the winter storm, 11 of them in weather-related car accidents and at least five others died due to cold exposure. About 1,000 roads are still affected by the severe weather, Kidd said.

The Texas National Guard has been deployed across the state to conduct welfare checks and assist local authorities in helping those in need find a local warming station, according to Abbott. On Friday night, guardsmen delivered 28,000 water bottles to Austin for Texans still without access to drinking water.

Texas has received a total of 5.5 million bottles of water and 2.1 million of those have already been distributed, Kidd said. Officials expected to deliver 1 million bottles of water Saturday.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has helped raise $4 million for relief efforts as of Saturday night for Texans in need, she said in a tweet after a day of distributing aid alongside Rep. Sylvia Garcia and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats who represent Houston.

More than 15 million people were under orders Saturday to boil tap water in the wake of the punishing winter weather that began a week ago and has paralyzed the state, caused frozen and burst water mains and residential pipes, and created chaos for water treatment facilities, according to a spokesperson for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Frozen pipes hampered the Killeen Fire Department's efforts to get an overnight blaze at the Hilton Garden Inn under control, officials said. All of the hotel's 102 rooms were occupied when the Hilton's automatic sprinkler system failed, the department said. Seven agencies assisted in bringing the fire under control just after midnight, and authorities only reported minor injuries.

Biden said Friday he plans to visit Texas next week if it doesn't create ""a burden.""

On Saturday, Biden tweeted that the federal government has already ""sent generators, blankets, water, and other critical supplies to Texas.""

His major disaster declaration unlocks grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster, the White House said in Saturday's statement.

It also includes federal aid for eligible local government offices and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency protective measures and hazard mitigation measures statewide.

“The funds provided under the Major Disaster Declaration may provide crucial assistance to Texans as they begin to repair their homes and address property damage,” Abbott said.

Acting FEMA Administrator Robert Fenton named Jerry Thomas as the federal coordinating officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas.

Kidd said about 700 Texans have already registered to receive federal aid. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said winter storm survivors can apply for assistance online and encouraged those who can to file claims with their insurance.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has helped raise $4 million for relief efforts as of Saturday night for Texans in need, she said in a tweet after a day of distributing aid alongside Rep. Sylvia Garcia and Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrats who represent Houston.

""I think this shows that New York stands with you, but the whole country stands with you,"" Ocasio-Cortez said during a press conference Saturday morning.

The three lawmakers distributed supplies to help the millions of Texans lacking basic necessities in the wake of the record-breaking winter storm that has left at least 46 dead in 10 states, the majority in Texas.

""Texans do not want to go through this again. They want accountability. They want to know why the system failed and quite frankly, almost broke,"" Garcia said Saturday morning.

The winter storm has also left parts of other states without power: Mississippi reported more than 55,000 outages Saturday afternoon while Louisiana is grappling more than 36,000 outages, according to poweroutage.us.

In Tennessee, the Memphis International Airport reopened its passenger terminal at 3 p.m. local time after officials were forced to temporarily close it and cancel all flights because of water pressure issues on Friday.","President Joe Biden declared a major disaster for much of Texas as the state reels from a severe winter storm that left millions of people without power amid freezing temperatures.

A second winter storm moving through Mississippi Thursday left thousands without power, and continued to affect travel and an array of services.

The cold weather is to continue into Friday. High temperatures will range from the lower 30s in northern Mississippi to the mid-40s in southern Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service in Jackson. However, some sunshine is expected to break through the clouds Friday.

""We're going with a hard freeze warning across most of the area again, generally along the northwest of the Natchez Trace tonight,"" Mike Edmonston, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson, said Thursday.

Edmonston added that all winter precipitation is expected to be over by Thursday evening for most of the state.

While there may be some thawing today there is a possibility of refreezing that can occur tonight and tomorrow morning, resulting in black ice on the roads. Temperatures will be dangerously cold. With the melting ice, be on the lookout for downed power lines and fallen trees. pic.twitter.com/2trokGH50q — msema (@MSEMA) February 18, 2021

Jackson area temperature forecast

Thursday: High, mid 30s, low, 22 overnight

Friday: High, mid-upper 30s, low, 18 overnight

Saturday: High, 40s, low, 30 overnight

Edmonston said the freezing temperatures Thursday and Friday night could lead to black ice, making it dangerous for drivers who might think the roadways are dry.

Sunday's temperatures in Mississippi will be in 50s

Edmonston said Sunday's high will be in the mid to upper 50s for most of the state, with the possible exception of Northwestern Mississippi.

Another cold front is expected to come through the state Sunday night, brining with it a chance for light rain. The northwest portion of the state could see a wintery mix, Edmonston said.

Power outages impact over 178,000

Early Thursday morning, the number of power outages was almost 200,000 throughout Mississippi. At 1:30 p.m., Poweroutage.us reported at least 137,090 power outages across Mississippi.

Entergy officials in a news release Thursday morning said nearly 90,000 customers were without power at 7:30 a.m. The company had more than 1,300 workers trying to restore power to homes and businesses, according to the release.

At 1:30 p.m., Entergy's outage map showed 71,974 customers without power. Southern Pine Electric showed 18,997 outages.

Officials continue to ask customers to conserve energy to prevent further power outages and included several tips on how to help limit energy usage.

Lower the thermostat to 68 degrees

Unplug electronic devices and turning off lights when not in use

Open blinds, drapes and curtains to let sunshine into the home

Delayg laundry, washing dishes and non-essential uses of electricity

Wash clothes in cold water

Taking a quick shower instead of a bath

Cook foods at the lowest possible setting

Don't allow warm air to escape the home

Mississippi Homeland Security tweeted Wednesday power outages can make some foods unsafe to eat.

The Center for Disease Control suggests to throw away any perishable food items that have not been refrigerated properly due to power outages, as well as any food with an unusual smell, color or texture.

WATER PRESSURE

Today the City’s pressure is still fluctuating between 70 to 80 psi. We have made gains in the recovery and more residents are being restored with water. This is a fluid process as the system continues to gain pressure. Each day more residents should be seeing their water restored.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP. Today’s reading is up from 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

The City Water Maintenance Department is still battling water main breaks, and making progress on the repairs. Please see the list below of confirmed, unconfirmed, and completed water main breaks. The City encourages residents to report any water main breaks to 311. A complete list of water main breaks is at the end of this release.

48,"Feb 21, 2021",ABC News,Boil water advisory lifted in Houston as Texas recovers from winter storms,"Millions of Texans have had their water restored in the past 48 hours.

Houston has lifted its boil water advisory as much of Texas' utility services recover from back-to-back winter storms.

The boil water advisory in Houston had been in place since Wednesday but has been lifted after water quality testing submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality confirmed that tap water meets all regulatory standards and is safe to drink, according to a press release from the city.

""The historic freezing temperatures in Houston last week caused water pressure to drop throughout the city,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement. ""I appreciate everyone's patience as Houston Water crews worked nonstop to restore the pressure and gain the TCEQ's approval to lift the boil water notice.""

Nearly 3 million bottles of water have been distributed in Houston since Wednesday, Turner said.

The freezing temperatures and snow from the storm knocked out power grids, ruptured water mains and rendered water treatment plants unworkable.

On Friday, more than 14.4 million people in Texas, about half of the state's population, were affected by weather-related disruptions to water service. More than 1,100 public water supply systems reported disruptions in service on Friday morning, according to a spokesperson for the TCEQ.

More than 5 million people have come off boil water advisories in the last 48 hours, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in a press conference Sunday afternoon. It is unclear how many Texas residents are still under a boil-water advisory. Busted pipes remain an issue, and the state is bringing in more plumbers to speed up the recovery, Abbott said.

""We want to make sure that the state is stepping up to do everything that we can to help people in their homes who are trying to repair busted pipes,"" he said.

About 30,000 Texas residents are still without power, but all power should be restored by Monday, Abbott said.

Of the 76 people who died as a result of the inclement weather last week, half of them resided in Texas, The Associated Press reported.

President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Texas to allow federal aid to flow into the state.

“Most of my city is not going to be affected but what is affected, I know I got a call from holiday inn they’re pretty upset because they don’t have no water on the second floor at all,” said Byram mayor Richard White.

The mayor broke down the area of Byram using the well-water and surface water. He said everything west of the interstate except the apartments in Byram is the surface water area that comes from the reservoir.

“Everybody on surface water would be the apartments, Holiday Inn and everything on the interstate 55 and everything down to Jackson industrial is going to be boil water starting right now,” he said.

Currently, Byram gets its surface water from Jackson. Mayor White is pushing for the city to get control of its own water.

“This is just another opportunity for us to have our own water and that’s what I will be pursuing, I think that is something that’s needs to be done,” he said.","(WJTV) – Some businesses were affected by the city-wide water outage, including the Holiday Inn Express near I-55 South in Byram.

54,"Feb 16, 2021",WJTV,Your pipes are frozen. Now what?,"OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — Many homes across the country are keeping their faucets running to prevent pipes from freezing, but what happens if you fail to prevent them from locking up?

Plumbers say there are some things you can try to fix the issue, but even for them, pinpointing and addressing the freeze is difficult.

“I’ve gotten the most frozen pipe calls I’ve ever had, and I’ve been plumbing for 27 years,” said Jason Walmsley, with Trinity Plumbing in Oklahoma City. “I’ve never seen it like this.”

Depending on where your pipes are located, Walmsley said you might be able to thaw them out yourself.

“If it’s just the hot side, it’s usually the water lines in the water heater closet are frozen, especially in the garage,” he said. “If it’s the whole house, I’ve seen some water service lines under ground that are frozen, and if that’s the case you have to wait for it to warm up, unfortunately.”

Walmsley said as long as you don’t leave them unattended, you can try space heaters or even blow dryers, although the latter are less effective. Just make sure to open up the cabinets and turn on the faucet so if it thaws, water can flow through.

“In my experience, most of the time, the small electric heaters and stuff like that don’t work, especially with how cold it is now,” he said, referencing the cold snap that has brought freezing temperatures and power outages across several states in the South and across the plains states.

Even with his tools, solving the puzzle is tough.

“You look at one area, if it’s nothing, you move and just keep going and going,” Walmsley said.

Even heavy-duty construction-grade insulation may not be enough protection in communities facing temperatures 30 or 40 degrees below normal. If you do look to add insulation, you will want to wait until frozen pipes thaw before wrapping them up.

The best prevention is running your faucets more than a drip, even if that means wasting water around your house.

“I know it sounds crazy and may waste a lot of water, but in my mind, that’s cheaper than your pipe freezing and busting,” he said.","OKLAHOMA CITY (KFOR) — Many homes across the country are keeping their faucets running to prevent pipes from freezing, but what happens if you fail to prevent them from locking up?

While the Mississippi city of Jackson works to fully restore water, various community organizations have been filling in the gaps with relief. Mutual aid is a new term for some, but providing it is an old practice in many Black communities.

“As a southern Black girl, who grew up in rural Mississippi, mutual aid has always existed in my life,” Calandra Davis, an organizer with the Jackson chapter of Black Youth Project 100 (BYP 100), told NewsOne. Davis said community institutions have always provided aid in times of need. “The churches [and families] in my community always provided mutual aid,” she added.

Providing support to communities in Jackson and across the state, the Mississippi Rapid Response & Relief Coalition is a statewide coalition, including rural partners. Member organizations include the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, the People’s Advocacy Institute, the Milestone Cooperative, Mississippi M.O.V.E., Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition, BYP 100 and Sarah’s Touch.

Davis said the organizations took on various roles in the storm’s aftermath, each finding its own lane.

“Some people were preparing and delivering food,” Davis explained. “Others were helping to find water and get it out to people.”

She said BYP 100 helped get money into the hands and pockets of people who lost income.

“We also secured hotels for folks who were without power and water,” Davis shared.

Members of the coalition were engaged in community outreach work even before the current water crisis.

“We take a holistic approach,” Sharon Brown, founder and executive director of the Council of Sisterhood, a philanthropic organization, said. “[Our] work didn’t shift, it became harder because we couldn’t get the supplies that we needed to provide for the people in the community.”

Brown said she founded the Council of Sisterhood in 2013 with her sister Valerie Brown.

“We started the organization because we saw the needs of our community not being met because of systemic racism,” Brown explained. She said that her organization has provided everything from clothing to food and even money to help pay utility bills.

“The village is only as strong as the members,” said Brown. “And so if you have one family hurting, then the whole community hurts and suffers.”

The current crisis comes as communities continue to deal with COVID-19. Mississippi is one of two states that recently lifted pandemic restrictions put in place to protect public health and safety.

The disregard for Black lives has been clear even before the pandemic, but existing through the layered crisis has been a real eye-opener for some people.

“We’re really just seeing environmental issues and racism paired together,” Davis said. “And [there are] no real systemic solutions are being offered.”

Rukia Lumumba agreed with Davis and framed the current crisis as a part of a larger challenge.

“Over the last few years, we’ve just been seeing the weather changes become more significant,” Lumumba said in an interview with NewsOne. “And it has consistently harmed our communities, more so than any other community.”

Lumumba is the founder and executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, an organization she envisioned alongside her father, the late Mayor Chokwe Lumumba. She is also the older sister of Jackson’s current mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. At its core, the People’s Advocacy Institute is a community capacity-building and training organization. Lumumba and her team, along with partner organizations, work to uplift impacted communities.

While the city has set up local distribution sites, Lumumba sees the grassroots relief effort as people stepping up to do what needs to be done. She said once the roads were safe, some people drove as long as two hours to find water.

As a part of the Rapid Response and Relief Coalition, Lumumba and the People’s Advocacy Institute fielded requests for food or hotel assistance, water distribution and even money.

“We’ve seen a decline in people asking for hotels,” Lumumba explained. “But now we’ve seen an increase in people asking for financial assistance to cover everything that they lost.”

From pipe repairs and fixing other related damage to buying groceries, people have incurred additional expenses because of the winter weather and water outage.

She said the groups have provided support in Jackson and the greater Hind County area as well as several rural communities from the Mississippi Delta to communities in central and northern Mississippi.

“The collective effort is critical to our sustainability,” said Lumumba. “Our livelihood [and] our ability to survive is intertwined with our ability to work together.”

Lumumba recounted the first week of the winter storm that left highways closed and services disrupted all over.

“Prior to this, anytime there were any major weather changes, our water system was in jeopardy of shutting down in certain areas of town,” explained Lumumba.

She said this impacted South and West Jackson more than any other areas, noting these are predominantly Black and poor areas of the city.

When asked about the state response, Lumumba described the governor’s attitude and approach as a part of a long-held disregard the state’s white elected officials have for both the city’s Black leadership and residents. At one point late last month, the governor made a comment about the state taking over Jackson’s water system.

“What really needs to be done is major infrastructure investment on the federal and state level,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder and Executive Director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, said last week on MSNBC show “The Reid Out.” She challenged claims that the governor could not reach Mayor Lumumba, as Jackson is the Mississippi state capitol placing the governor in close proximity to city government officials handling a crisis.

“But that’s how little the priority is,” Roberts continued. “And it’s not just Jackson, the Mississippi Delta is without water right now.”

Looking forward, Lumumba said the coalition is thinking about how to operationalize how they do rapid response.

“What we’re trying to do now is think about how we create these rapid response hubs,” she shared. “We know that there are going to be more and more storms and changing weather conditions that shift how we’re currently living. There is no guarantee that we are not going to be able to live the way [we do].”

Brown said climate change is real and needs to be a factor considered in whatever next steps are taken.

“And this will not be the first crisis, but one of many crises,” she said. “Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the nation, but at the end of the day, it’s a group of folks that really love and care genuinely about what happens with our community…we represent, and we stand in love.”

Davis compared the current moment to other times of awakening that brought people into organizing. She said some people had “an aha moment” after the killing of Trayvon Martin or last summer with the killing of George Floyd.

“For some folks in rural Mississippi and Jackson it is going to be the ice storm and water crisis,” said Davis. “I believe [this crisis] will cause people to collectively come together [and] use their power to make some structural changes to what has been happening in the city for decades now.”

58,"Feb 19, 2021",,City Distributes Safe Water in Jackson As Winter Storm Effects Continue,"The City of Jackson is distributing safe drinking water at six locations throughout Jackson today. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced yesterday that the water is now available at specific times depending on the location. Metrocenter Mall is a major distribution point for both drinking and flushing water.

Non-potable water for flushing is also now available at almost all fire stations throughout Jackson. Residents need only bring a container to fill. Exceptions to available fire stations are Station 20 on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Station 10 on Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Station 22 on Lakeshore Drive.

Boil-Water Notice In Effect

The mayor also addressed Jackson’s boil-water notice, which is still in effect. “We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,” Lumumba said. “Only to tell you that we are continuing to pump into the tanks, and we are continuing to try to recover within the water system.”

Jackson’s city-wide boil-water notice remains in effect as cold weather hinders the city’s ability to maintain water pressure.

Gov. Tate Reeves also commented on Jackson’s water issues at a Wednesday press briefing. “For all intents and purposes, we are without water in downtown Jackson,” the governor said.

City buildings remain shuttered today as bitter cold continues to hamper water and power in Jackson. A City of Jackson press release, updated yesterday, reads: “City Hall and all other City office buildings will remain closed due to weather conditions on Thursday, February 18, 2021. All City of Jackson employees that have been working remotely should continue to do so.”

Reeves gave a winter storm update in his Wednesday afternoon press briefing. “What we’re seeing happening now is a continuation, a new front, but a continuation of some really challenging times here in our state,” he said.

Reeves also thanked those working to keep essential services going in the state. “There are a lot of men and women that are putting themselves in harm’s way and we want to thank them,” he said.

“Our linemen from our rural electric co-ops to our men and women that are working at TVA and Entergy and Mississippi Power. Those men and women are out in this weather helping protect us, and we want to thank them, along with our first-responders and our health-care heroes and so many other people.”

The governor warned of possible continued snowfall and ice accumulation, which can continue to limit power and water services around the state, as well as make travel hazardous. “Our roads are very challenging right now,” Reeves said.

Garbage collection and JTRAN, Jackson’s public transportation system, will remain unavailable until road conditions improve.

Power Outages Continue

The mayor also gave an update about the winter storm’s effects on the city yesterday. “Entergy has estimated that they have experienced between 18,000 to 19,000 customers that have a power outage at this time,” he said. “These power outages are largely due to large limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain over the last day.”

Tree-cutters must first remove the fallen limbs before Entergy can work to restore power across the city.

Entergy reported 90,000 customers without power in the state yesterday, and while that number is down to around 55,000 today, the weather is still hampering repairs. “Although our workers restored service for thousands of customers yesterday, the wintry conditions created new outages throughout the day. The pace of restoration should increase today as the weather improves and temperatures rise,” this morning’s press release from Entergy stated.

The Public Services Commission regulates power rates in Mississippi so costs are estimated at the beginning of the year, which means customers will not see their bill change mid-year due to any particular storm or energy shortage. However, cold weather can increase bills by making heating systems use more power.

Entergy Senior Lead Communications Specialist Mara Hartmann spoke to the Jackson Free Press about what people can do to relieve some of the pressure on their home heating systems. “Heating and cooling make up the biggest portion of anyone’s bills,” she said.

“If you’ve got an electric water heater, then you can get one of those real inexpensive blankets from a home improvement store that you just wrap it around there and tape it on, and it helps keep the water hotter, longer,” she said.

“We also urge people to use weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows, roll up a towel, stick it underneath a door that goes outside,” she said. “Seal around anywhere you can feel cold air coming in.”

Entergy offers programs for anyone struggling to pay their electric bill, which can be found here.

63,"Feb 19, 2021",ABC News,Cities slammed by winter storms face new crisis: No water,"States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another

AUSTIN, Texas -- States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Broken water pipes brought on by record-low temperatures have created a shortage of clean drinking water, shut down airports and left hospitals scrambling.

Texas authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water due to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

And in Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 was without water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to drive to set locations to pick it up – leaving elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway, located on a hill, is a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, is running out of his heart medication, with enough to get him through Sunday, because she hasn’t been able to make it to the pharmacy to refill it.

“It would be nice to have some type of answers,” she said. “People are in dire need here. We need urgent help.”

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after ice and snow storms swept through early in the week, forcing utilities from Minnesota to Texas to implement rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids.

Texas’ grid operators said Friday that the system has returned to normal for the first time since a storm knocked out power to more than 4 million customers. Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, says the grid again has enough capacity to provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered an investigation into the failure in the energy capital of the U.S., while ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages early Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 59 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond. A growing number of people have perished trying to keep warm.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Abbott urged Texas residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect the system as the ground began to warm and pipes thaw.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state’s water outages were in north Louisiana and in the southwest city of Lake Charles, which still was struggling to recover from Hurricane Laura. He said bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to hardest-hit areas and would be focused on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers.

Edwards said he was grateful that warmer weather was forecasted across Louisiana by Saturday.

“I expect that over the next several days, we will make repairs to the water systems and get things functioning as close to normal as possible,” the governor said in a live event with the Washington Post.

In a statement released Monday afternoon, Entergy asked customers to reduce energy usage as much as possible from 5 to 9 p.m.

Haley Fisackerly, president and CEO of Entergy Mississippi, said demand for power in the region has dramatically increased over the past two days due to the extreme cold the area is experiencing.

Crabtree lives in northwest Waco near the Hillcrest Elementary School and said she has been without power since early Monday morning. She was encouraged when the power came back on Monday night. But her hopes were dashed when it went off 2 hours later and has been off ever since.

“I hadn’t gone to bed yet, and I was so happy when it came back on,” she said. “But it went off and it hasn’t come back on yet and they say it’s supposed to snow a lot tonight.”

Crabtree’s son lives nearby and has been coming by to check on her. She said she went out to get the mail Monday, slipped and fell and has not been out since.

“I decided I didn’t need to do that anymore,” she said.

Her son’s home has power, but he also has three pit bulls that do not get along with her three dogs, and she will not leave them home alone, she said.

Crabtree also is worried about the 150 multiple varieties of tropical fish she has, including six larger ones in a 90-gallon aquarium that are accustomed to water temperatures between 78 and 80 degrees.","Carol Crabtree, 78, moved to Waco a couple of years ago and said she might as well have stayed in Wichita, Kansas, if these are the types of winters Waco will continue to experience.

68,"Feb 16, 2021",CNN,Officials slam grid operator as dark comes and millions remain without power,"(CNN) With approximately 1.2 million residents in the Houston area without power, a Texas official slammed the company that runs the electric grid, saying: ""The bottom line this evening is, we're in for another long night.""

The National Weather Service office in Houston was predicting rain and freezing rain Tuesday night with temperatures in the 20s.

Harris County Judge Lena Hidalgo said it has been a natural disaster and a man-made one as well. She was one of several officials from the state calling for answers from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a grid operator that controls about 90% of the state's electric load.

""Every night since this started, we've seen less generation, not more,"" Hidalgo said. ""So, let me give it to you straight based on the visibility I have -- whether you have power or not right now, there is a possibility of power outages even beyond the length of this weather.""

About 3.3 million homes and businesses were without power in Texas on Tuesday evening as a result of freezing temperatures and a deadly winter storm that swept into the state early this week. The entire state saw temperatures below freezing during at least parts of Monday and Tuesday, and utilities have been knocked out or frozen over by the bitter cold -- leaving many without primary means of heating their homes.

ERCOT said it expected to restore electricity service to some customers Tuesday afternoon, but ""the amount we restore will depend on how much generation is actually able to come online.""

ERCOT CEO Bill Magness said his company averted a total disaster.

""I think from the perspective of the grid collapsing, I think what has happened here is a response that kept the grid from collapsing, that kept us from going into a blackout condition,"" he said. ""Now the difficulties that this has imposed on the citizens of Texas, everybody in the state, have been enormous.""

Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and the Texas speaker of the house were among those calling for a look into how ERCOT dealt with the storm.

Abbott said he wants an investigation and swift reform of the system.

""The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""Far too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather. This is unacceptable.""

Responding to the governor, Magness said the company sees the need for an investigation.

""Electricity is an essential service,"" said Magness. ""As we do the event analysis after this is over, once we get through the emergency and we get customers back on, we want to participate in that, we want to learn lessons, because if, you know, there's mistakes that we can be correcting, you want to find them, and we want to put the processes in to correct them.""

Galveston County Judge Mark Henry said ERCOT officials were less than forthcoming with information ahead of the deadly storm that has left much of his county battling power outages and freezing temperatures.

""We were told Sunday afternoon in a message that there'll be rolling blackouts, about up to an hour off, and then up to three to four hours on,"" he said. ""That was fine. That didn't happen. The power went off, it stayed off. We had no rolling blackouts at all in this county.""

He said county officials would have made different decisions, including calling for people to evacuate, if they had been told the power was going to stay off.

Three die in carbon monoxide incidents

Frigid temperatures and widespread power outages plagued swaths of Texas for the third straight day Tuesday, sending numerous residents to vehicles, fireplaces and shelters in desperate search of warmth.

In the town of Nevada outside Dallas, Clint Cash said he's resorted to living in his car parked in an open area outside his home, which had largely been without power since Sunday evening when temperatures dipped into the teens

""I'm wearing several layers of clothes to keep my body warm"" and using heat from his vehicle, Cash, 44, told CNN affiliate KTVT on Monday

The cold is believed to have contributed to at least three deaths in the Houston area alone, police said. That includes a woman and a girl who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a car was running in the garage at their home to create heat because the power was out, Houston police said Tuesday morning

Another person died in Fort Worth from a carbon monoxide incident, according to fire officials there.

The Harris County fire marshal's office, meanwhile, has reports that more than 50 people have suffered carbon monoxide poisoning relating to heating issues during the cold spell, Hidalgo said.

Treacherous weather conditions have led to more than 550 car crashes in the area since Sunday, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said.

""Our roadways are still very icy. Please avoid traveling unless absolutely necessary,"" Acevedo said on Twitter

Huge electricity demand

Officials have said some utilities' ability to generate the power has been frozen -- including natural gas and coal generators. said intentional, rolling power blackouts will happen in parts of the state to balance huge demand with struggling supply

Temperatures are expected to be below freezing throughout Tuesday in roughly the state's northern half, and they may just reach above it in Houston and San Antonio, according to a National Weather Service forecast

While snow has fallen across much of Texas, more snow and ice are expected for much of the state through Wednesday as part of a larger storm system

Up to 6 more inches of snow could fall in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, while freezing rain is forecast for Austin, San Antonio and Houston.

""We're looking at some more rain and sleet tonight,"" San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said. ""This could be the worst night as far as temperature.""

Hood said his department has had a rough week with the storm, ""We had 2,608 calls for service yesterday. We did about four times the number of calls we do on a normal day.""

A truck braves the frozen roads in Houston on Monday, February 15.

Relying on fireplaces and generators

Barbara Martinez had a mission Tuesday that she wouldn't normally undertake: find more wood for the fireplace that has become her home's main source of heat in freezing weather.

Her home in the Houston suburb of Jersey Village has been largely without power since Sunday at 3 a.m., she told CNN.

She, her elderly parents, and her two dogs have been huddled together in one room with a fireplace.

""We have several layers of clothing and it's cold,"" Martinez said. ""We've been using our cars to charge up phones, and (the) signal here is nearly impossible to use.""

""We hope the power comes back soon because we are running out of firewood,"" she said. ""My goal today is to find more firewood.""

Barbara Martinez's father sits in front of the fireplace at her home in a Houston suburb.

In the Fort Worth suburb of Watauga, Elijah Dorminy's family has depended on their generator to make it through the deadly cold -- and he fears that soon even that won't be an option.

Dorminy, his wife and their four children were worried what will happen when they need to refill their generator with gas again. Only one gas station still had fuel in Watauga, Dorminy told CNN on Monday evening.

""Pray for us, this is going to be rough,"" he told CNN.

Water shut off in Abilene, and cell phone service interrupted outside Houston

The city of Abilene said it was forced to shut off water service Monday evening because of a power outage at three water treatment plants.

The city of about 120,000 people is about a 150-mile drive west of Fort Worth.

Power has since been restored to one water plant and crews are working toward the goal of restoring service to most of the city by day's end Tuesday, officials said

When service is restored, a boil water notice will be in effect, and customers should bring water to a vigorous boil for at least two minutes before consumption, according to the statement.

""Texans with electricity are asked to conserve as much as possible in an effort to relieve the demand on the state's power grid and help restore service,"" the city said.

Covid-19 vaccines and appointments at risk

The storm has complicated Covid-19 vaccinations, causing appointments to be postponed and threatening supplies.

No first-dose vaccines were being shipped to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District on Monday and Tuesday because of winter weather, according to a news release.

San Antonio postponed vaccine appointments scheduled for the Alamodome stadium until Saturday, according to a news release from the city.

""With the current icy conditions expected to remain until at least tomorrow, we want to ensure the safety of the public. We also want to remind the public who may be concerned about the small delay for their second dose, that we are still within CDC guidelines to ensure the vaccine will still work with no issues,"" the release stated.

After power was lost at the Harris County Public Health building and backup generators failed, officials had to race to allocate and save 8,400 vaccines before they spoiled, Hidalgo, the county judge, said Monday.

Harris County officials settled on Houston's Ben Taub, Lyndon B. Johnson and Houston Methodist Hospitals, as well as Rice University and the Harris County Jail as the locations to receive the vaccine overnight, Hidalgo said.","Hide Caption 10 of 55 Photos: Winter storms wreaking havoc in the US Snow falls in New York's Times Square on Thursday.

70,"Feb 19, 2021",WJTV,"Power, water outages reported in Vicksburg on Friday","VICKSBURG, Miss. (WJTV) – Temperatures are rising in Vicksburg and Warren County, but so are frustrations as people go into day two of no running with water or power.

Water main breaks have been found and all are sealed off but even that has not brought water back to the homes and businesses of many people including hotels off Clay Street.

Mayor George Flaggs said the water treatment plant is back up and running at capacity which would pump nine million gallons a day through the city.

But people are being asked to conserve water even when it is turned back on so the main tanks and towers can fill up. For some, the pace is not moving fast enough.

Families around the city left their own homes to stay with family or spent nights at City hotels just to simply take a bath, brush their teeth or use the toilet.

Mayor Flaggs explained the bitter cold temperatures could have also freezed valves or pipes causing the longer wait times which property owners have to check.

“What has happened is the pressure is up to the complex valve but on the other side there’s some frozen pipes. And because of that they can’t get service for pressure or water. If they’ll drain and open that valve just a little bit then before the days over they should have water,” said Mayor Flaggs.

Over 5,700 homes and businesses in Warren County are still without power.

Mayor Flaggs explained more Entergy crews have arrived, but the threat of branches taking out lines is not over as ice weighs down trees and power could be out until at least Saturday.

Later on Friday, the mayor said Entergy Mississippi assigned 12 additional crews to Vicksburg to assist in restoring power.","(WJTV) – Temperatures are rising in Vicksburg and Warren County, but so are frustrations as people go into day two of no running with water or power.

74,"Feb 18, 2021",,"Under Boil-Water Orders, Texas Water Supply Is Strained","Under Boil-Water Orders, Texas Water Supply Is Strained

As power outages begin to ease in Texas, utility problems still remain. High demand continues to stress hundreds of local water systems as millions of Texans are now under orders to boil water.

AILSA CHANG, HOST:

As power returns to some Texas residents, many face problems with water service and safety. As member station KERA's Bret Jaspers reports from Dallas, millions of people are under boil water notices, and thousands have no water at all.

BRET JASPERS, BYLINE: Carolina Jackson lives in the city of Fort Worth. She's one of the people living under a boil water notice.

CAROLINA JACKSON: Once I found out, I was like, oh, great. I don't know how much we've already consumed, so hopefully we don't get sick. But so far, so good.

JASPERS: It's not just Fort Worth. Parts of cities across the state, including in Houston, Austin and San Antonio, are under boil orders. LouAnn Campbell is a spokeswoman with the city of Tyler.

LOUANN CAMPBELL: The water pressure is below levels that are required by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, TCEQ, and that water pressure maintains optimal safety for the water. So we can't meet that pressure.

JASPERS: If the pressure drops too low, it raises the risk for contamination, which is why the water needs to be boiled. Tyler's problem originated with a power outage at a pumping plant. The power is now returned there. But lost power isn't the only thing causing low pressure. Around the state, there's been a big increase in demand from customers.

Denise Hickey is with the North Texas Municipal Water District.

DENISE HICKEY: We're having problems delivering the water to the cities as fast as the cities are using it.

JASPERS: Hickey's agency serves about 80 cities in North Texas. She says during a typical winter day, they deliver 250 million gallons of water. On Tuesday, they delivered over 350 million gallons.

HICKEY: That's a hundred million gallons more just in one day. So that was over what our normal is.

JASPERS: The cause of the high demand is anything from more people at home, to burst pipes and water main breaks. As infrastructure at water systems and homes unfreezes, there can be cracks and other damage, further jeopardizing service. Local officials are urging residents to conserve.

Victoria Nakamura is with the city of Denton.

VICTORIA NAKAMURA: At this point, we're just emphasizing any form of conservation. We're grateful for that and we're thankful for that.

JASPERS: And some cities are even asking people to not follow the time-honored advice for avoiding a burst pipe - trickling the faucet. Luis Pino of Fort Worth is keeping his water flowing for now.

LUIS PINO: I know my water bill is going to be hell next month, but, you know, it's going to cost me more if I shut them and then, all of a sudden, everything freezes.

JASPERS: And temperatures will stay near or below freezing until Friday.

76,"Feb 19, 2021",Waco Tribune-Herald,"Waco winter update: Waco mayor issues water conservation order; laundry, car wash businesses closed","Today, the Mayor and City Manager of the City of Waco took steps to ensure protection of our water system as we recover from the winter storm of the past week. These steps are necessary because our water supply remains critically low.

While rising temperatures are welcomed for residents and businesses, rising temperatures will thaw water pipes and reveal new leaks which must be valved off and repaired. From a water system standpoint, these new leaks will drain the water system further.

While we do not expect shutting off the water throughout the entire city, a community-wide boil water notice is imminent if demand doesn’t change. This demand is being caused by leaks around the city and high usage. The City of Waco is pumping twice our normal daily usage and the system’s storage is sitting at a critically low capacity.

If the system conditions worsen, some areas may not have water at all, depending on water system pressures and elevation. If system conditions worsen further, the fire department could not have adequate water for firefighting. Our staff continues to develop alternative methods of fire protection, but water is the critical resource to protect property in the event of a fire.

***To help preserve our water system storage, action is required.***

Mayor Meek has signed an emergency declaration which takes the following actions regarding the water system:

--- All cleaning/dyeing and laundry plants, commercial laundry (self-serve commercial), and automobile car washing establishments in the City are required to cease all operations and activities until noon on Monday, February 22, 2021.

--- All other commercial and residential customers are urged to reduce water consumption and to not hoard water. Each person is urged to keep water use to not more than one gallon per person per day, and not more than one gallon per day for cooking for the household.

City Manager Bradley Ford, acting under his authority within the City’s Water Conservation Plan, has issued an order requiring the City’s top industrial water users to submit and obtain approval of a water consumption plan prior to conducting any business. City of Waco Water Utility staff will contact these users immediately. These water consumption plans will be submitted to the City’s Water Utility Services Department for prompt evaluation and response. Approvals will be granted by City Manager Ford. City Manager Ford has also directed each of the cities who purchase water from the City of Waco to require water consumption plans for their top industrial users.

In recognition of the impacts to local residents and businesses from this storm, Mayor Meek’s emergency declaration waives permit and inspection fees for the repair of damages caused by the winter storm. Permits and inspections are still required.","From a water system standpoint, these new leaks will drain the water system further.

77,"Feb 16, 2021",Houston Chronicle,Plumbers 'haven't seen the worst of it yet' as cold weather bursts pipes across Texas,"Long after Houston thaws from its historical winter storm, many people whose pipes have frozen and burst likely will face extended waits for repairs as plumbers across the region report unprecedented demand.

Pipes have been bursting across Texas since Sunday night, creating a nightmare scenario for plumbers, who said the storm has had far-reaching impacts — unlike anything they’ve seen before. As power outages continue, frozen and broken pipes are hitting many people with a double whammy — no running water. Getting pipes repaired will be a challenge in the coming days, even after temperatures rise.

“We expect to be booked for two to three months,” said Vince Horvath, a master plumber at Best Plumbing, a company that services commercial properties such as apartment complexes.

Plumbers are seeing flooding from burst pipes in basements, drenched ceilings collapse from attic water lines and wet walls, said Horvath.

“We haven’t seen the worst of it yet,” he added.

Pearland-based Epic Plumbing received more than 200 calls by noon Tuesday, according to manager April Maly. Right now the wait time for service is about two days.

“Our phones have been ringing off the hook since yesterday,” she said. “A lot of people who’ve called have said that we’re the only ones answering right now.”

Kelli Victorian, marketing manager for Village Plumbing and Air, said her team had received 300 calls by 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, crashing the phone system.

Tom Pierce of Tom Pierce Plumbing said Tuesday morning he was working 55 calls and was too tied up to talk.

Vicki Mendez, office manager of Chavez Plumbing on the Northside, said her crews were busy turning off water at the street to try to prevent damage when frozen pipes thaw and adding insulation under pier and beam houses with pipes that hadn’t frozen solid yet.

Erika Chew, office manager of Houston Plumbers, said she’s been getting about double the number of calls the company normally receives.

“Houston wasn’t prepared for this,” she said. “(Freezing pipes) don’t ever happen here.”

In areas that commonly experience cold weather, pipes are wrapped in material to prevent freezing, said Maly. Another challenge at the moment is fixing PVC pipes, because it’s too cold for the glue required to dry.

The damage plumbers are seeing this week far exceeds what they responded to during the freeze of January 2018, said Horvath.

“After that freeze, we were still repairing back flows into June and July,” he said.

Not much can be done until after the weather warms, Maly said.

“You can try to use a heat lamp to warm the area around the frozen pipes,” she said, adding that method may not be successful and those who don’t have power don’t have that option.

Pipes can burst once they thaw or while they are still frozen, said Maly.

“Either one is a hard fix,” she said.

On top of the cost of fixing the pipes, the damage from the water to building and personal property can be more costly, Horvath added.

Mike Morris contributed to this report.

78,"Feb 16, 2021",Houston Chronicle,"With supply still too low, Centerpoint tries new strategy: Spread the Houston outages around","With electricity supply still far too low to restore service to all customers, CenterPoint Energy has adopted a new strategy, an executive said Tuesday afternoon: spreading outages around.

The change is aimed at restoring power for some customers who have been without it for almost 48 hours by shifting sustained outages to those who have so far had service, said Jason Ryan, the utility’s senior vice president for regulatory affairs.

“We’ve been focusing on the customers who have been bearing the burden of this event from the beginning starting about 1:30 a.m. (Monday), and working through the list to transfer those outages who haven’t yet,” Ryan said at a news conference.

These new shutoffs, Ryan cautioned, are not the rolling blackouts that the utility had hoped to provide. Instead of brief blackouts lasting 15 minutes to an hour, the utility said customers who suddenly lose power should not expect the lights to come back on for 24 hours.

Some 1.2 million CenterPoint customers are in the dark as of Tuesday evening, about the same figure as a day earlier. Less than 5 percent of the outages were caused by the winter storm that swept through the region early Monday.

Ryan blamed the balance on a decrease in generation by power plants. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s energy grid operator, said this was due to frigid temperatures decreasing the capacity of Texas power plants.

Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo urged ERCOT not to make overly rosy predictions about when power may be restored to more than 4 million customers across the state.

She said Houston-area residents should prepare to make do without electricity for several more days, even after temperatures warm, because power plants may need more time to rebound.

“Whether you have power or not right now, there’s possibility for power outages beyond the length of this weather,” Hidalgo said.

CenterPoint pledged to provide an update to the public each morning until full service is restored, Ryan said.

Power outages only made those situations worse, officials said.""If you don't have any power, you're not even warming your homes at all, so the houses are just standing there with no power, pipes are going to freeze .... just like mine did,"" he said. ""My pipes froze, and when the power came back [Tuesday] afternoon, my pipes burst. It's happening to everyone. This is a storm with no respect for persons.""In Galveston, water supply levels were holding steady Thursday morning, but they weren't increasing, city officials said.""We will keep the water service on as long as possible, though intermittent disruptions may be necessary as we attempt to stabilize the water supply due to major water line breaks across the island,"" said public information officer Marissa Barnett.Pump stations on 30th Street and the airport were running, but officials said they were aware of many areas of the city that were still experiencing issues.Boil orders across the state could last longer than usual due to the unprecedented number of water supplies that were compromised by outages and pressure issues, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Executive Director Toby Baker. Baker says testing will have to be conducted to ensure water is safe before the orders can be lifted.There are only 135 labs in the state that do that sampling, he said.","Some images showing the damage from the extreme cold to our water supply systems.

WAYNE, W.Va. — Challenges continued to mount Saturday for thousands of workers trying to gain the upper hand on power outages in a six-county region in West Virginia hard hit in separate ice storms during the past two weeks.

Appalachian Power Company reported more than 40,000 customers remained without power Saturday afternoon in Cabell, Wayne, Lincoln, Putnam, Jackson and Mason counties. More than 9,000 customers had service restored Friday.

The power company has more than 3,200 workers on the job. Many of them are staying in portable housing at the Huntington Mall parking lot which has turned into a small city.

Crews have found more than 1,500 locations where repairs are required, 550 power poles that need replaced and roughly 2,400 spans of wire that need to be put back up.

Repair work is difficult and more problems are continually identified, but progress is being made each day,” Appalachian Power said in Saturday afternoon’s report. “As an example, workers have replaced the same pole in Wayne County three times because more trees keep falling on it.”

Ice storms hit on Feb. 11 and then again on Feb. 15. It’s believed more than 6,000 customers have been without power since the initial storm.

Appalachian Power still hopes to have all service restored to customers in Putnam, Lincoln, Mason and Jackson counties along with the Milton area in Cabell County by 10 p.m. Monday. The estimate is 10 p.m. Tuesday for Wayne and Cabell counties.

The restoration assistance continued to receive assistance from National Guard units and state police troopers Saturday.

The Guard has three chainsaw teams clearing roads and property and other teams using Light Medium Tactical Vehicles to make welfare checks on some cutoff residents in Wayne County.

Troopers are also helping with clearing efforts and welfare checks.

Various crews from the state Division of Highways began working on the storm-impacted areas shortly after the first ice storm.

(WCBI) – Starkville city officials were hoping the worst was behind them but Starkville Utilities says Thursday brought the most major issues of the winter storms so far.

Starkville resident Wallace Killcrease woke up to find the tree that used to stand in his front yard lying on the corner of W. Main and Raymond Streets and Starkville Utility crews already on the scene.

“I heard chain saws, and when I went to heard chain sales, that sort of gotten my attention.”

Wallace says the entire street was still without power as of 1 p.m. after the tree came down at around 3 in the morning.

But crews were back on scene to fix that minutes later.

“I don’t have a number but we’ve had hundreds of these called in,” said Starkville Utilities General Manager Terry Kemp. “But most of them have been identified with one or two significant trees on circuits that we had.”

Kemp said Killcrease’s tree fell across one of the primary circuits that feeds the downtown Starkville area. He said another tree also fell on a circuit feeding the Northeast section of the city.

This was all after Kemp’s team started the day responding to a water main break on 182 and Jackson Street. While Kemp says he doesn’t think the weather was main reason for the break, he did say the ice and freezing temperatures made replacing the 10-inch section of pipe more challenging.

“The weather does add an element to have in any type of emergency restoration,” Kemp said. “If we talk about water you know the conditions out here having to deal with those makes it really hard on some of the employees.”

Starkville Police were out on the roads assisting the utility crews by searching for incidents where trees or power lines had fallen on the road.

“Officers are out marking fallen wires, trees, anything that could be hazardous, especially as you go to the evening hour,” said Police Chief Mark Ballard.

Ballard said his officers found over 30 events with debris in the road by Thursday afternoon. The city agencies worked together battling the elements to make sure the citizens of Starkville stayed safe and warm.

“We had some outages associated with ice and tree limbs that have come down but as of right now, most of our customers are back online,” Kemp said.","(WCBI) – Starkville city officials were hoping the worst was behind them but Starkville Utilities says Thursday brought the most major issues of the winter storms so far.

Jackson will remain in Amarillo for the duration of this historic weather emergency as he deals with rolling power outages and frozen water pipes like many residents of TX-13.

See Jackson’s full statement below.

“My office is tracking information coming from The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and Governor Abbott,” Jackson said. “I urge Texans to stay home, conserve energy, and utilize only trusted information sources during the ongoing winter weather conditions and power outages. I would like to thank our state leaders, Texas National Guardsmen, FEMA, and countless power company employees for working around the clock to respond to the unprecedented weather challenges we are facing.”

Here’s what we know:

ERCOT’s latest update: “ERCOT is restoring load as fast as we can in a stable manner. Generating units across fuel types continue to struggle with frigid temperatures.”

The Texas Division of Emergency Management’s situation reports can be found here. Latest details include: Governor Abbott has deployed the National Guard across Texas to conduct welfare checks and to assist local authorities in transitioning Texans in need to one of the 135 local warming centers across Texas.

Call 2-1-1 or use this online tool to find the warming shelter closest to you.

Per KFDX, the City of Wichita Falls has set up a temporary relief station at MPEC for those without power or water.

Only travel if absolutely necessary. If you come across inoperable traffic lights use extreme caution and treat intersections as if they’re governed by stop signs.

Be aware that frozen pipes could burst this week. Helpful tips can be found here.

Atmos Energy:","WICHITA FALLS (KFDX/KJTL) — Congressman Ronny Jackson released a statement Tuesday in response to winter storms resulting in energy shortage in Texas.
Jackson will remain in Amarillo for the duration of this historic weather emergency as he deals with rolling power outages and frozen water pipes like many residents of TX-13.
“My office is tracking information coming from The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), the Public Utility Commission of Texas, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and Governor Abbott,” Jackson said.
“I urge Texans to stay home, conserve energy, and utilize only trusted information sources during the ongoing winter weather conditions and power outages.
This number includes outages caused by weather and outages caused by the ERCOT directive to begin rotating power outages."
94,1 month ago,Texas Monthly,Forty-seven Days Without Running Water After the Winter Storm—and Counting,"For many Texans, the winter storm and the failure of the Texas grid has begun to recede from day-to-day consciousness, becoming something of a bad dream that has been happily left behind. But in the white, three-bedroom home on Berry Street in Houston’s Third Ward, where Ricarro Middleton lives with his four young children, fianceé, and sister, the nightmare is impossible to move on from because it hasn’t ended.

The Middletons’ pipes froze, and eventually burst, during the storm, and for the past six weeks the family hasn’t had running water. Their toilet works only from time to time, and faucets in the home offer little more than a drip. They subsist on bottled water for drinking, cleaning, cooking, and, occasionally, bathing. Middleton, who lost his job during the pandemic and remains on a limited budget, estimates that every week he spends about $50 on water and $250 on hotel rooms so his family can take hot showers. In an effort to save as much money as possible, he rations his children’s water usage, making sure nobody drinks more than six 16.9-ounce bottles per day. “My kids ask me every day, ‘Daddy, is the water coming back?’” Middleton, said, shaking his head. “I say, ‘Yeah it’s coming back, we just have to wait.’ As a dad, it’s hard when you feel like you’re lying to your kids.”

The truth is that the 34-year-old father has no idea when water will be restored. Many neighbors living in a dozen or so households on surrounding blocks in the heart of Houston’s historically Black Third Ward are also without it. This week, Texas Monthly met with five of them, all of whom continue to battle the aftereffects of February’s storm, including broken pipes and water-damaged rooms, black mold, badly needed home repairs that might cost thousands of dollars, power outages—and now threats of eviction. The residents all have something else in common: a landlord, J. Brad Batteau, who, they say, refuses to fix their homes in a timely manner. They now find themselves in an increasingly bitter dispute—involving allegations by Batteau that his tenants have committed arson on his property—that Houston mayor Sylvester Turner has gotten involved in.

Some tenants say Batteau, who has run for city council multiple times, isn’t a “bad guy,” but that he’s unable to manage the dozen or so homes that he owns in the area. But other residents have lost all trust in him and believe he’s unwilling to spend the money required to maintain his properties. Humi Jackson, a program coordinator with the Black United Fund of Texas, a nonprofit that does philanthropic work in Black communities, has been working closely with Batteau’s tenants to get their homes fixed. She said the landlord has refused to pay for repairs, claiming that his tenants are responsible for them while also refusing to sign off on the contractors they have attempted to hire. A copy of the tenants’ lease agreement obtained by Texas Monthly states that “major maintenance and repairs” are the landlord’s responsibility.

Reached by phone, Batteau justified the lack of repairs, saying all who had gone long periods without water were behind on their rent, and denied that he had stopped anyone from hiring plumbers. He too had been without water for a while and said he felt personal responsibility for fixing others’ pipes, some of which he did repair. But he said he didn’t have the money to pay for fixing all of them because residences he owns had sustained as many as fifteen broken pipes each, many tenants were behind on rent, and his home burned down in the middle of March.

He then alleged that tenants had ignited the blaze but, as of press time, did not provide evidence for his claim. Asked about Batteau’s allegations, Jackson said the landlord is engaged in an audacious campaign to avoid his legal responsibility to fix his tenants’ homes.

The dispute has now risen to the attention of Houston officials. Councilwoman Carolyn Evans-Shabazz, whose district includes Third Ward, and Mayor Turner have been in touch with Batteau in recent days and have urged him to hire contractors to complete the repairs, but he has refused because of fears that he would not be able to pay them back and liens would be placed on his properties. Evans-Shabbazz is coordinating with several nonprofits to provide the residents with food, rental assistance, and water while negotiations with Batteau continue. “You have children, small children—somebody had a five-month-old baby in one of these homes—as well as elderly people,” she said. “I just don’t understand how you can treat people that way.”

“I know he’s run for public office several times and this is what you do?” she added, moments after she received a text saying that Batteau was now threatening to evict tenants. (Batteau later confirmed he was considering evicting every tenant of his who was behind on rent, which he said was all but one.)“This is an indication that you’re no public servant at all.”

As the dispute proceeds, some of the tenants would like to relocate within Third Ward, where they have lived for decades. But the neighborhood is gentrifying, and affordable housing has become difficult to find, so many find themselves stuck. “Third Ward is the heart and soul of Houston,” Jackson said, “but these residents aren’t feeling like that at the moment.”

A week after the winter storm and the failure of the Texas grid, some 14 million Texans went without access to safe drinking water, and 350,000 had no running water at all, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Widespread pipe problems—one in four homes in Houston had damaged water systems—meant that some had to wait weeks for a plumber’s visit. But many in the residences Batteau owned have gone, or went, without running water far longer than most in the city.

In one of Batteau’s residences, three elderly Houstonians packed into a $300 per-month dimly lit one-room apartment, no bigger than many walk-in closets. One, a 72-year-old woman who uses a wheelchair and identified herself as “Mrs. Sarah,” said she’d been relying on bottled water since the February storm. Unable to walk, she’d been receiving water donations from friends like Flip, an elderly homeless man who lives underneath a nearby bridge and was now visiting her. Both were thirsty. Jackson promised to return with water later that afternoon.

Many of Batteau’s tenants said if Texans knew about the reality of their circumstances, they’d have a hard time believing it was unfolding in the nation’s fourth-largest metropolis, surrounded by museums, universities, and wealthy neighbors. “A 72-year-old lady in a wheelchair should never be without water,” Flip said. “What if she catches herself on fire with a cigarette and doesn’t even have a glass of water to put it out? This is a damn shame, y’all.”

A few blocks away, across the street from Batteau’s charred residence, I met Shannon Sublette, the director of a senior care facility in the neighborhood. She had been without water for forty days before Batteau repaired some of the many burst pipes in her three-bedroom gray clapboard home, which she shares with relatives. Before water was restored, every time one of the residents wanted to drink or flush the toilet, two young relatives were forced to turn on the main water valve near the street and then place a plastic bin in a crawl space beneath the home, where they were able to collect water from a broken pipe.

In a bathroom near the back of the house, water from a broken pipe was seeping through the floor. Down the hallway, inside Sublette’s bedroom, the overpowering stench of mold caused our eyes to water. Sublette opened a closet door revealing a damp, basketball sized hole in the drywall, where, she said, Batteau had tried to fix a broken pipe before giving up. She was terrified rats and opossums might crawl into the home through the hole. Sublette and her relatives have begun spending as much time as possible sitting on a handful of metal folding chairs outside the home, where they have access to fresh air. “We stay outside all day and we stay out until we have to go inside at night,” she said, noting that hot weather and hurricane season are on the way. “Inside, I start coughing and sneezing and have trouble with my skin, and now I’m on allergy medicine just so I can survive inside my bedroom.”

Around the neighborhood, residents shared similar stories. One man with a newborn and three other children, Austin Stevens, said he’d blown through his savings paying for bottled water to drink and wash his baby’s bottle with. “Who wants to give a baby a dirty bottle to drink from?” Another man, Freddie J. Alexander, a 47-year-old father of two, who lives with his sister, her children, and an elderly aunt, had resorted to praying that the city will step in. “When a landlord puts his tenants in an environment where they’re forced to bathe with bottled water, that is what you call a hostile environment,” he said.

For many of the residents in Batteau’s homes, this was not the first time living in Houston that they’d gone weeks without power and water. Sublette had lost almost everything in Harvey’s floodwaters in 2017. Middleton survived for several weeks without power during Hurricane Ike in 2008. Despite that painful history, this disaster felt different to both of them. “It’s like we don’t matter,” Middleton said. “Everyone else is living their lives again and it feels like the city has forgotten about us.”","The Middletons’ pipes froze, and eventually burst, during the storm, and for the past six weeks the family hasn’t had running water.

Since the power went out on Monday night, one family has been rationing oxygen tanks for their five-month-old son in their Killeen, Texas, home.

Angel Garcia says her son was born at 26 weeks and he requires supplemental oxygen. He only came home three weeks ago.

“We have an oxygen machine that converts room air, but since we’ve had no power, we’ve had to use our cylinders,” Garcia told CNN by phone on Wednesday evening. “Those went out and they only deliver those once a month. We’re not able to plug in his pulse oximeter to check on his oxygen. We’re keeping a constant eye on him to see how he’s doing.”

Her son, Christopher, was born with premature lungs. Garcia, a nurse, is watching him constantly, she said.

Garcia, her two children and her husband are trying to stay warm in their home. They made a makeshift heater out of a pot raised up on bricks above some candles. They are boiling bottled water because they don’t have water pressure at home.

The family was running out of wood, so they started burning their 3-year-old daughter’s baby blocks in the fireplace, she said. She shared a photo of her daughter, Jordan, watching the fire as her toys burned.

“A lot of people don’t know the severity of what’s going on. People are tearing down their fences to burn,” Garcia said in between tears. “We started burning my daughter’s little wooden blocks because it was just too cold.”

She says she hopes that people realize how bad the situation is in a state where people are not accustomed to this type of cold weather.

“Not everyone has gas but we waited in line about an hour and finally we were able to get some gas,” Garcia said. “There’s pretty much nowhere to go. Everyone in Texas is in the same boat. If they have electricity, there’s no water. If they have water, there’s no electricity.”","Courtesy Angel GarciaSince the power went out on Monday night, one family has been rationing oxygen tanks for their five-month-old son in their Killeen, Texas, home.

On Wednesday, the City of San Antonio launched an Emergency Resource Call Center and website to assist residents impacted by the storm. To access it, residents can call 311 and select option 5, call 210-207-6000 or visit the website. The call center will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.

The Texas Division of Emergency Management is asking Texans — residents and businesses — to report damage from the recent winter event, which will help the state receive financial support from the federal government.

Homeowners with insurance should make a claim with their insurance carrier. For those without insurance or if additional assistance is needed, a claim can be filed with the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Individual Households Program. To file a claim, call 800-621-3362 or visit disasterassistance.gov. Applicants must have a social security number to apply.

Businesses and rental properties that suffered damages can also apply for the Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Assistance Program, which provides low interest loans. For more information, visit the government agency's website or call 800-659-2295.

The SAWS Community Pipe Repair Fund is another avenue for individuals who don't qualify for FEMA's program. SAWS will prioritize emergency pipe repair that risks causing harm to life, health or safety of the occupants. To be eligible, applicants cannot qualify for FEMA assistance and their home value can't exceed $140,000, or have an annual income at or below 140 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, which is equal to $18,032 for an individual or $37,100 for a family.

To apply, visit the SAWS website or call 210-233-3499.

Here are more details about insurance and storm damage.

5:51 p.m. Texas Democrats went on the offensive Friday, saying years of neglect and corporate deference by Republican state leaders directly led to a week of deadly power outages.

3:47 p.m. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas on Friday declared this week’s state of emergency over during a press conference and apologized for the misery Texans have suffered.

“I want to acknowledge the immense human suffering we saw,” ERCOT President and CEO Bill Magness said. “When people lose power, there are heartbreaking consequences.”

Power has been restored to almost all CenterPoint Energy customers in Texas nearly a week after the winter storm left millions in the dark, the regulated utility company said Friday.

Fewer than 7,000 customers who still don't have power were expected to be reconnected by the end of Friday, the company said. CenterPoint, the regulated utility that transmits power to the Houston region, has more than 1.39 million customers. The last reconnections should be completed by the end of the day, the company said.

2:52 p.m. The Houston Food Bank will remain in ""disaster mode"" for days as residents confront food challenges following this week's storm, power outages and water problems.

After the winter storm iced roads and kept millions holed up without water and power, Texas officials anticipate major food shortages in the days and weeks to come, prompting the Houston Food Bank to kick start mass food giveaways that are already ramping up through the weekend.

“The food bank and all the partners we work with, we’re almost like the last resort,” said Brian Greene, CEO of the Houston Food Bank. “It can, for a lot of households, be the difference between getting by and tragedy.”

2:05 p.m. Domestic violence shelters in Texas are struggling to meet the immediate basic needs of survivors during the state’s winter crisis and fear the long-term impacts of the natural disaster will result in another spike in rates of abuse.

On top of prolonged periods without heat and power, many shelter facilities have flooded due to broken pipes, according to the Texas Council on Family Violence. All of the 40 organizations the council has been in touch with have limited food and water supplies as grocery store shelves are empty and water boil orders have been issued across the state. Hundreds of survivors were evacuated from facilities this week.

“The sad part about this is that domestic violence doesn’t stop during this,” said Gloria Terry, CEO of the nonprofit.

1:55 p.m. Late last year, Gov. Greg Abbott’s hand-picked utility regulators decided they no longer wanted to work with a nonprofit organization they had hired to monitor and help Texas enforce the state’s electric reliability standards.

The multi-year contract between the Public Utility Commission and the obscure monitoring organization, the Texas Reliability Entity, was trashed. Over the next months, right up until the crippling storm that plunged millions of Texans into the dark and cold, the state agency overseeing the power industry operated without an independent monitor to make sure energy companies followed state protocols, which include weatherization guidelines.

The decision to end the contract didn’t cause the historic grid failures, but critics say the utility commission’s move to strip away a regulatory layer was just the latest example of the consistently light touch Texas politicians have used to oversee the complex industry that generates and distributes power.

11:10 a.m. At least 4,900 people have called Houston officials to report burst pipes this week, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

""That number is probably even higher than that,"" Turner said.

Water pressure continues to increase throughout Houston as crews worked through the night, Turner said. The city-wide average pressure increased to 32 to 34 PSI on Friday morning, although some spots remained below 20 PSI.

The boil water notice remains in place and the city's goal is to lift the notice by Monday after clearing state environmental regulations.

It will take longer for water to reach full pressure for residents who live above the ground floor, said director of public works Carol Haddock.

""We are making steady, sustainable progress,"" Haddock said. ""We're taking this very deliberate action to make sure we can achieve getting out and staying out of the boil water notice.""

Anyone who sees water coming from an unoccupied home or building should report it to the city.

10:40 a.m. The devastating winter storm that hit Texas this week may delay vaccine administration by at least a week, said Julie Swann, an expert in vaccine supply chains and logistics at North Carolina State University.

“When you have a major disruption — a natural disaster like a hurricane, or a big storm with lots of ice and snow — lots of pieces of any supply chain may be disrupted,” Swann said.

8:05 p.m. Sunday’s snowfall blanketed the yard of Cristian Pavon Pineda’s home in Conroe as the 11-year-old frolicked about, covered by a red hoodie.

Less than 24 hours later, his mom would find the sixth grader lifeless in his bed — a suspected victim of hypothermia from freezing temperatures in a home that suffered a power loss.

It was his “first time (seeing snow). That’s why he was excited outside,” said Maria Elisa Pineda, adding she filmed him on her phone as he played, snapping photos. “Everything was well. He was happy that day. He was not at all sick.”

6:10 p.m. Sen. Ted Cruz says the plan for his Cancun getaway -- as much of Houston was left in the frigid dark -- was to stay through the weekend.

""I have to admit, it was --,"" Cruz said, pausing during a mea culpa news conference at his River Oaks home. ""The last week has been tough on a lot of folks.""

He said he had power at his inner-loop home longer than most and that the electricity cut out as friends came over for dinner. It stayed out for two days, he continued. By the second day, the Cruz family was ""clustered around the fireplace as the only source of heat.""

His daughters suggested the family take a trip to somewhere warmer. Which is how Cruz and family landed a flight to Mexico.

""I started having second thoughts almost the moment I sat down on the plane,"" he said.

5:36 p.m. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo on Thursday warned residents that the threat of this week’s cold snap has not quite subsided. With another night of freezing temperatures straining the power grid, blackouts remain possible.

“We have to be cautious; it’s not mission accomplished right now,” Hidalgo said at a news conference.

With many in the region with low or no water pressure, she urged residents to drain their pipes to prevent damage in the event of a freeze. County facilities will be closed again on Friday because of insufficient water pressure.

4:07 p.m. FEMA said a fake phone number is circulating online sharing false information that the agency is paying for hotels for disaster relief.

""The best information on legitimate sources of help in your area will come from local officials & @TDEM,"" the agency said in a tweet.

FEMA said it is providing generators and fuel to support critical sites like hospitals and water facilities. It is also distributing 729,000 liters of water and more than 50,000 cotton blankets.

3:53 p.m. Residents are finding ways to cope with freezing temperatures as power outages continue to affect the area. Sleeping in their cars, doubling up with neighbors, or heading to one of the county warming centers are just some of the ways people are trying to survive during the winter storm.

Maria D’Angelo, 87, has lived in Houston for around 20 years and has never seen anything like this. When her power went out on Tuesday she traveled north to Spring to stay with a friend, but soon her friend’s power went out again Tuesday night. D’Angelo needs oxygen for a chronic lung disease and her portable machine only lasts about two hours. After calling 911 she ended up at the temporary shelter set up at the Church Project in The Woodlands.

3:38 p.m. Gov. Greg Abbott is adding two more emergency items to the legislative session, he said during a news briefing. These include mandating winterization of generators and power system equipment and securing funding needed to ensure that winterization occurs, he said.

Separately, another official said during the briefing that roughly 13 million Texans remain under a boil water notice after water systems across the state were impacted in the winter storm.

3:09 p.m. Following Mayor Turner's announcement about city-wide water distribution sites, the Chronicle has asked each council member’s office for details about the distributions. Some locations have been announced but many officials still are coordinating and trying to confirm details, which are subject to change. Council members said each district is getting three pallets of water. Reporter Dylan McGuinness provides more details and available information about distribution locations here.

2:50 p.m. Even as power restorations continue and water pressure begins to improve, both systems remain ""fragile,"" said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo. People should continue to conserve both of these resources, she said. Ahead of tonight's hard freeze, do not drip faucets but prepare for plummeting temperatures by shutting off the water supply to your home, draining and insulating pipes.

The overnight freeze could increase demand on the power grid, although it's unclear what impact that may have on the system.

""Be mentally prepared for the possibility that there may be other challenges for tonight, but what I'm told is it's likely that we’ll be okay,"" Hidalgo said.

Road conditions have improved, so people can drive to the store to re-stock on supplies this afternoon if necessary, Hidalgo said. The county has received reports of price-gouging on items like food, water, fuel and warm shelter, she added. Residents should report any incidents to authorities.

The city is working to distribute water to other vulnerable populations, including senior citizens and those sheltering for warmth at Gallery Furniture. Each district council member is working to set up a water distribution site by 2 p.m. Thursday, Turner said. No addresses were provided.

The Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities has partnered with CrowdSource Rescue, a Texas disaster response nonprofit, to deliver bottled water to people with disabilities who don't have access to reliable transportation. People can sign up to help or receive help at this link.

Turner said he is coordinating with several philanthropic and corporate leaders to create a fund that would assist people without insurance, seniors and people whose homes sustained water-related damage to pipes and ceilings as many of those people ask, ""How do I move forward?""

""We want to do everything we can to pull together as a city to help provide you with the support and assistance to repair your home,"" he said. ""This is what we do in our city, this is how we make sure we don't leave anyone behind, and that we recognize people are already under a great deal of stress and strain.""

12:12 p.m. U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was feeling the heat Thursday as photos circulated online showing the Texas Republican traveling to Cancún while millions in his home state were left in the cold without power and water, reports Benjamin Wermund.

11:42 a.m. The water pressure has improved across Houston, said Mayor Sylvester Turner, although residents should continue to conserve water as officials try to build up and stabilize pressure. Pressure has improved as crews brought on more generators to augment the power source. Hospitals and jails reported improved water supply by Wednesday night and Thursday morning, Turner said.

The boil water notice will likely remain in place until Monday because water samples must be tested for environmental quality even after pressure returns to functional levels, Turner said. Bacteria can seep into pipes when pressure drops.

11:12 a.m. A man was found dead early Thursday in a north Harris County parking lot. The Harris County Sheriff's Office said there were no signs of trauma and they believe the death was related to the cold weather.

Including this death, at least 13 people have died in weather-related incidents across the Houston area this week, including crashes, fires and carbon monoxide poisoning.

Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the agency's homeless outreach team is assisting people experiencing homelessness with getting into shelter.

""This weather is not just cold, it’s deadly,"" he said.

10:58 a.m. Firefighters responded to an all-time record number of calls in the last three days, according to the Houston Professional Fire Fighters Association. Calls for fire and EMS clocked in at 2,186 on Monday, 3,299 on Tuesday and 2,793 on Wednesday, the organization reported.

Some water was restored, but numerous residents remain without running water. Officials warned that intermittent disruptions or isolated shut-offs may occur as crews work to make repairs. Residents should conserve water, limit shower times and avoid letting faucets run. A boil water notice remains in place.

""Thank you for your resilience and patience,"" officials said. ""We assure you we are working around the clock to secure water service.""

The city gave no estimated time of restoration.

8:52 a.m. Significant progress was made overnight in state-wide power restorations, although some people remain without power and more rolling outages are possible, ERCOT said in a statement.

""We’re to the point in the load restoration where we are allowing transmission owners to bring back any load they can related to this load shed event,"" said senior director of system operations Dan Woodfin. ""We will keep working around the clock until every single customer has their power back on.""

Those who remain in the dark most likely live in areas where the ice storm knocked out power or where the controlled outage will required a crew to come out and manually re-energize the line.

Some level of rotating outages may be needed over the next few days to keep the grid stable, ERCOT said.

8:27 a.m. One-fifth of Texas nursing homes have reported weather-related emergencies to the state following the onslaught this week of extreme cold, freezing rain and widespread blackouts. These include power loss, facility damage and environmental or other operational issues, according to the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. The latest state tallies Wednesday showed 18 of roughly 1,220 nursing homes had relocated or evacuated residents.

104,"Mar 16, 2021",The Daily Mississippian,Opinion: Political partisanship hurts people regardless of party,"Jackson’s water crisis serves as the most recent example of state politics taking priority over human needs, leaving thousands of Jacksonians without water. The LOU community and Mississippians at-large have rallied together to support victims of the outage, yet we have seen little from Gov. Reeves’s office and nothing from the federal government.

While Jackson residents continue without water and other crises –– such as Texas’s water and power outages or the now one-year-old pandemic –– occur across the country, entire states are blamed for the inaction of their governments while little aid makes its way to those affected. People find it easy to dismiss the problems of citizens of states that are labeled as politically opposite. Even though our state is consistently labeled as deeply red, 41.6% of Mississippians voted for Biden/Harris in 2020.

In our ever-polarizing United States, the “redness” or “blueness” of governments is often the scapegoat for a plethora of incompetences. This led millennial Democrats to sip their coffee while Georgians died of COVID-19 in April and former President Donald Trump to say to “take the blue states out” of national COVID-19 numbers. Human needs have now become a matter of state political representation and not of its victim constituents.

Supporting Black lives means supporting Black lives in red states. Mississippi, Georgia and Louisiana are the Blackest states in the nation. Historically, they are among the reddest states as well. If the Democratic Party claims to support Black people more than the GOP, Democrats must not directly oppose itself against red states. “Red states” are never homogeneously Republican, and demonizing a state for the beliefs of its governor or its two senators degrades its residents.

In the American political system, it seems that a simple 50.1% majority can decide the fate of a state or the nation for years to come. This, however, is complicated by systemic gerrymandering and voter suppression found in every state. Steps have been taken to combat this corruption, but these artificial boundaries create deep divisions across the country. Rather than representing their constituents, politicians are fighting for their party’s advantage; this leaves all Americans behind, except the small few whose beliefs directly align with the Republican or Democratic party.

Georgia serves as a great example of why politically typecasting states is not productive. As part of the Southern Bible Belt, many Democrats regarded Georgia as a lost cause to the GOP. However, grassroots organizers, such as Stacey Abrams, mobilized Georgians to go to the polls and flipped the state from red to blue in the 2020 election. This led many Democrats to celebrate their new blue ally, including those who made fun of Georgia’s COVID-19 numbers earlier that year.

Blind allegiance to a party is bad for all, but when that allegiance translates into attacks on the opposition, undeserving victims are impacted the most. The division between red and blue states ignores the systematic marginalization of voting groups within the US and blames a lack of progress on constituents rather than ineffective politicians. Ending the crises in Jackson and Texas requires a closer look at the needs of Americans beyond the color of the state.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- As the city of Houston continues to deal with widespread power outages that are impacting more than a million Houstonians, water pressure issues are now another big concern.The issues with water pressure and threats of possible contaminants forced the city to issue a boil order. So what's the city doing now? What about the fire department? How are they managing to battle fires with low water pressure?Here's everything we learned at Mayor Sylvester Turner's news briefing on Houston's severe weather on Wednesday.Leaders of ERCOT, the nonprofit council that oversees the power supply for more than 26 million Texans, met on Wednesday and they couldn't offer an exact timetable for full restoration.""Power will not be restored fully, I would say, probably for another couple of days,"" said Turner. ""I understand people's frustration, I understand people's anger, but we'll continue to work together to work through it.""During the briefing, Carol Haddock, the director of Houston Public Works, said at the moment, the challenge is with the city's water distribution system.""What we experienced, starting Tuesday around noon, and degrading over the afternoon, was a decrease in water pressure in the large part of the system that got below 20 PSI (pound-force per square inch),"" said Haddock. ""I'm not going to make excuses. We have generators throughout the system, and they did not start because the temperatures were too cold for the generators to start.""She said crews had to manually go out and warm the generators up, even though they were just fine on Saturday.Haddock did offer a reason to remain optimistic. She said starting Wednesday, crews will begin increasing production and pressure.""We actually have our East Water Purification Plant back up to 70 PSI pushing into the system. Yesterday, it was down to about 40 PSI,"" she said. Haddock said at the moment, they're working the system to prioritize pressure to places like the Texas Medical Center and other medical facilities.Until the city gets its water back up and fully restored, Haddock urges people to limit their water use.Not at the moment, according to Turner, but he has asked large, Houston-area grocers such as Kroger and H-E-B to increase their water supply.""But in terms of planning mass sites ... I'm not saying they won't occur, but that's not in our plans right now,"" he said.During Wednesday's briefing, Turner revealed he was one of many Houstonians whose pipes froze and burst.""If you don't have any power, you're not even warming your homes at all, so the houses are just standing there with no power, pipes are going to freeze .... just like mine did,"" he said. ""My pipes froze, and when the power came back [Tuesday] afternoon, my pipes burst. It's happening to everyone. This is a storm with no respect for persons.""Houston Fire Chief Sam Pena said over the last 24 hours, firefighters have responded to 3,300 calls for service, most of which have been for emergency medical services. That's three times their normal call volume.However, he said there has been an increase in fires, which is concerning, he said, due to the city's low water pressure issue.""We've sent resources to about 56 structure fires over the last two days,"" he said. ""The best recommendation for this community, for us to do the right thing, is to be fire safe in your home. Be mindful for how we go about this. Don't use your stoves or your oven to heat up your homes.""Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo offered a piece of good news during Wednesday's briefing regarding city traffic.He said since Sunday, which is when the winter storm began ravaging through the city, officers reported only one fatal accident in the entire city.""We should celebrate that, but we should expect more extreme roadway conditions, so slow down,"" said Acevedo.As of Wednesday afternoon, the mayor said the city is still on schedule to open the site on Monday, Feb. 22.""We will probably return to testing and vaccines safely ... I would say Friday,"" said Turner. ""Then the FEMA site will open on schedule on the 22nd, unless I'm told otherwise.""Turner said this week's shipment of vaccine doses has been delayed due to weather.

109,"Mar 1, 2021",Vox,"“It’s after the storm that’s the hardest part”: 390,000 Texans still don’t have clean water","As of Monday morning, it had been two weeks since Helen McCanick and her neighbors in Wharton, Texas, had running water. The freezing temperatures brought by Winter Storm Uri burst their pipes and broke the motor running their well.

McCanick has spent the days since the storm traversing neighboring towns, searching for the pipe and motor parts needed to restore her water. “I am very tired of running from place to place, I really am,” she said from the parking lot of yet another hardware store.

To cook and flush the toilet, the 73-year-old has had to resort to using donated water or heavy buckets she hauls from a local church. And with replacement parts in short supply after the storm, McCanick still doesn’t know when she’ll get her water back.

“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.

Even after the electricity came back on in most homes as of February 19, water problems have lingered on a large scale. As of Monday, nearly 390,000 Texans were still being told to boil their water due to safety concerns after the storm disrupted utility water supplies, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). And that number doesn’t include the people, like McCanick, who can’t get water because their pipes broke in the cold — an issue that has affected thousands of homes in Houston alone.

The widespread failures in Texas reflect the domino effect that happens in many disasters, as power failures lead to breakdowns in water systems, putting people’s health and food security in danger. And Texas isn’t alone: Extreme weather — in some cases directly linked to climate change — has impacted water access for days, months, or even years in other states, including in the fire-ravaged West.

And yet, the long-term impacts of disasters on water systems often get less attention than the initial disaster.

For instance, the devastating Camp Fire in Paradise, California, made headlines in 2018 as the deadliest fire in the state’s history, but few know that 40,000 people were initially told to boil their water after the fire. And later, when carcinogenic chemicals were identified in the town’s pipes, Paradise residents were told not to drink their water at all — it wasn’t until more than six months after the fire that water access started to be restored.

As climate change increases the threat of extreme weather and disasters, it’s clear our infrastructure systems need to be able to withstand new pressures. And there’s a lot to learn from the latest water crises in Texas and California to avoid the next fiasco.

What caused the water failures in Texas

At the height of the water crisis on February 19, nearly 15 million people across Texas lost access to clean water, according to Gary Rasp, a spokesperson for TCEQ. This number reflects the problems that occurred in the water system itself, rather than in people’s homes.

Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, explained how the crisis rippled from the electricity grid to the water system. As the storm hit, the rapidly escalating blackout on February 15 forced water treatment plants offline. At the same time, the freezing temperatures broke water mains and people started to turn on their faucets to prevent their pipes from freezing.

Due to the combination of a drop in supply from treatment plants failing and the increase in water demand from dripping faucets and leaks, the pressure dropped in the system.

A loss in pressure can lead to dangerous bacteria in the water supply, so millions of people were told to boil their water before drinking or cooking with it. Of course, this was an impossibility for those who were also hit by the power outage and lacked electricity to power their stove.

The winter storm didn’t just cause water issues in Texas. From Oklahoma City to Jackson, Mississippi, hundreds of thousands of people also faced water shortages due to dropping water pressure.

Beyond these systemic failures, people like McCanick have also been dealing with problems closer to home, which aren’t reflected in the official numbers. One of the biggest issues has been broken pipes. In buildings not designed to weather the plunge in temperatures — from schools to houses — pipes froze and burst, sometimes dramatically, as captured in viral TikTok videos of flooded houses. Corinne Whitehead, a 70-year-old resident of San Antonio, told Vox she heard the squish of water on her floor as she stepped back into her apartment after the storm to find her pipes had burst.

And in some cases, residents have been without water for weeks because of a confluence of failures.

In the rapidly gentrifying Riverside neighborhood in Austin, Rebecca Sanchez told Vox that many of the residents in her apartment complex, the Hillside Villas, have been left without any running water for two weeks after pipes burst. Repairs have been slow, and Sanchez said the property managers have failed to provide adequate emergency water supplies in the interim. In response, she and other tenants organized a small protest last Tuesday, which the management tried to shut down by calling the police.

Afterward, the property managers accelerated the repairs, but Sanchez said half of the buildings still did not have water access as of Monday, while other properties in the area were back up and running. Further complicating matters, the city also discovered a broken water main near the complex on Friday, making the timeline for restoration of water access even less clear. The Hillside Villas property managers did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

For Sanchez, the water crisis has shown how the burden of disasters often compounds existing inequities. “It is mostly Black and brown [people’s] apartments and parts of the city that are feeling this,” she said. “There were entire white communities that never lost power and never lost water.”

Extreme weather threatens Western states’ water supplies

From the hurricanes that have hit the Gulf Coast to the wildfires that have spread across the Western US, many other communities have found themselves without clean water in the wake of recent disasters.

Just as widespread leaks and overuse caused the water system to fail after Winter Storm Uri, when houses or pipes burn in a wildfire, water pressure in distribution pipes can drop and can create a vacuum, sucking in contaminants. It was only after a resident smelled a strange odor in their tap water after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California, that scientists first uncovered such widespread chemical contamination (benzene in that case) in water systems after wildfires.

Since then, contamination after fires has led to thousands of people in a rising number of communities being put under “do not boil, do not drink” notices. This happened recently after the CZU fire struck Boulder Creek near Santa Cruz, California, in August, burning a 7-mile stretch of plastic water pipe. And like the lingering problems in Texas, these water systems have not been easy to rehabilitate.

In Boulder Creek, it took months for the water company to clear the system of the benzene — a dangerous carcinogen — initially detected, and conduct extensive testing to ensure it was really gone.

In the interim, Boulder Creek residents like Sophia Lwin-McGee were forced to live without tap water. She and her family hauled a 5-gallon water jug from a water spigot in town and tried to rely on that water or bottled water to drink, cook, and bathe.

Sitting on her deck overlooking the remains of a burnt redwood forest, Lwin-McGee told me in October that the lack of safe water access wasn’t something she expected in the US. “I feel like I’m back in Burma,” she said. “I left there when I was a kid to avoid this situation. But you know — take water, go to town, get water, bring it back — like, we are doing that every other day.”

Even after the local water company officially announced their water was safe, she and her family said they would continue avoiding the tap water as much as possible, at least for a year.

“I just can’t put myself and my son and my husband in that risk,” Lwin-McGee said. “So we are just going to have to buy bottled water to drink and cook with until, you know, we feel that it is safe.”

With climate change causing drier, hotter falls in the Western US, the conditions for extreme fires and impacts to water systems are increasing, according to a 2020 study published in Environmental Research Letters.

Stefan Cajina, a drinking water section chief for California’s State Water Resources Control Board, said he’s witnessed these changes firsthand. “I think in the last half-decade we have really seen an escalation in how [wildfires in] the wildland-urban interface can have an impact on water systems and communities in general,” he told me this fall. (Residential areas like Paradise and Boulder Creek that are on the edge of forests are described as the WUI, or wildland-urban interface, and are the most vulnerable to destructive fires.)

These rising threats mean fortifying infrastructure to handle extremes is all the more important. But Emily Grubert points out that even where climate change isn’t definitively linked to the extreme weather event, as is the case with the winter storm in Texas, the fundamental need for more resilient infrastructure is clear.

Related Scientists are divided over whether climate change is fueling extreme cold events

“We underinvest in maintenance to such a degree that these disasters tend to be pretty catastrophic,” she said. The failure of infrastructure is still being felt by the 390,000 people boiling their water in Texas today, and the nearly 2,000 people whose utilities were still not delivering water at all as of Friday, according to TCEQ.

“Adapting to extreme events and adapting to climate change is going to make all of this harder, but that’s not the only thing that is a problem,” Grubert said. “What we are really starting to have to face is this kind of combined issue where we have failed to invest in these systems for a very long time, and now we are also playing on hard mode.”","“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.

110,"Mar 19, 2021",Dallas Morning News,"H-E-B, known for coming to the rescue with water and hot meals, added electricity to that list","H-E-B and Central Market’s head of energy, George Presses, shows two slides when he makes a pitch to management: a bright, busy store and one that’s dark, with hundreds of thousands of dollars of perishables going bad.

“Everyone takes electricity for granted,” said Presses, vice president of fuel and energy for the San Antonio-based grocer.

While Texas’ electric grid failed to provide reliable power during last month’s winter storm, a complicated and redundant system that H-E-B and Central Market have created with Houston-based Enchanted Rock Energy passed the difficult test.

The system, which includes installing a natural gas-powered generator behind a supermarket, costs H-E-B about $1 million per store. For that, H-E-B gets uninterrupted electricity during outages, saving as much as $500,000 in perishable food in a typical store.

So far, H-E-B has installed 161 generators around Texas, including at its Central Market stores in Dallas, Fort Worth and Plano. Its Southlake Central Market doesn’t have a generator, and it lost electricity and was closed during the February power outages.

Only about 40 of H-E-B’s 351 stores in the state lost power. Contrast that with the world’s largest retailer, Walmart, which had about 500 stores without power at various times during those five days in February, most of them in Texas.

H-E-B, known for its operations acumen and coming to the rescue with water and hot meals during hurricanes, doesn’t like to leave the details to others. The retailer started looking for solutions in 2015 when a new store in Lake Jackson lost power on the day of its grand opening.

The next year, H-E-B signed a formal agreement with Enchanted Rock of Houston, an energy technology company founded in 2006 to create long-duration backup power micro-grids that it owns, operates and maintains. Last summer, the city of Houston hired the company to build a system to keep its water purification plants operating during power outages.

On the line

Presses remembers the date the first generator was installed because it was the first test of his expensive project.

The generator was installed at the Bay City H-E-B store on Dec. 23, 2016. On Jan. 20, 2017, the store had a power outage.

“It worked perfectly,” he said. The system takes zero to eight seconds to start supplying full power after an outage. “Most of the time a store doesn’t even know it’s had a power outage until we tell them.”

The second generator, in Houston, also performed well during an outage soon after it was installed.

Hurricane Harvey, which was the most expensive storm in Texas before February’s freeze, was a huge test. Since then, H-E-B has been installing the iROC package, which stands for Integrated Reliability on Call, wherever it can.

Besides the cost, there are other considerations when the company decides to add iROC to a store.

The shopping center has to have the space, the natural gas supply has to have the pressure and ability to expand, and the electrical operator has to agree to connect with a proprietary transfer switch, Presses said. The 40 stores that were out of power in February were all in the Austin market, where H-E-B doesn’t have an agreement with Austin Energy.

“There’s nothing stopping others from doing this, but it’s about how you value your position in the economy,” Presses said. “We think we’re indispensable.”

Seeing that customers can also depend on the store to warm up or recharge their phones is gratifying, he said. “All my friends in Houston know which H-E-B stores have a generator. When power was out after the Dallas tornadoes, people were in the café at our Midway Central Market all the time to charge up their phones.”

Tired infrastructure

Texas’ unpredictable weather forced H-E-B to come up with a way to marginalize its risk, Presses said, but that’s only part of the reason the company is investing in iROC.

Presses likes to tell people that the oldest appliance in your house isn’t the TV or the refrigerator — it’s the transformer your home is hooked up to.

Most of the nation’s high-voltage transmission infrastructure was built in the 1960s and 1970s and isn’t equipped to accommodate the way people are using electricity today, according to a recent report from the Business Roundtable.

Extreme weather such as Category 4 hurricanes and the arctic blast that covered the entire state of Texas last month will continue to put more pressure on the electric grid.

The Texas power outage was the topic of a hearing in Washington on Thursday before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology chaired by Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas.

Princeton University engineering professor Jesse Jenkins testified that planning and building resilience is “more difficult now more than ever because of the change in climate means the past is no longer a safe guide to the future.”

In San Antonio, H-E-B also built and operates its own solar energy system that connects 62 buildings — stores, warehouses and food manufacturing plants.

“We derive the entire benefit of the energy, and it’s saved us money,” Presses said.

Power isn’t as visible as potholes, Presses said, but the problems are still there.

His ecosystem is a grocery chain that’s a demanding user of electricity. When he started working for H-E-B 23 years ago, “our stores weren’t as energy-intensive. Now we cook more and have more fresh and prepared foods.”

After an outage, ovens can take 24 hours to get back up to required productivity levels, stores have to be cleaned and customers can’t shop, he said.

“It’s a lot harder for us to lose power today,” Presses said. “Unfortunately, for all of us, we’re probably going to see more and more of this.”

112,"Feb 11, 2021",WJTV,Entergy encourages Mississippians to prepare for threat of winter storm,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – As we inch closer to bitter temperatures taking over the weather all weekend and into Monday, people are urged to keep a close eye on how their communities handle the icy conditions.

As many look to hunker down with plenty of food, Entergy says you should be on the lookout for power lines and poles going down. Authorities in times like these urge everyone to not go out in these conditions unless they absolutely have to. But in order to stay in you have to have the necessary supplies for the whole family.

One by one, customers filled their carts to the top at metro grocery stores, making sure they would not need any reason to head out when the Arctic blast fully reaches the area.

“Bread, water, nick nacks like those finger foods and stuff like that,” Lula Green said while shopping at the Cash Saver in South Jackson. “Make sure I got all the supplies that I need.”

“Chicken, fish, fruits, vegetables, and cookies they like cookies for my boys to eat,” shopper Courtney Martin told us. “Because I know we’re going to be inside.”

While home many have preparations in mind with keeping their home weatherized by cutting off cold drafts from the outside and not get forced into raising their heating bill.

“I got different stuff at my windows and doors taped down to keep this cold from coming in,” Green stated. “Don’t open and close it so much just stay in.”

Entergy management added there are specific temperatures to keep heaters on to avoid being overcharged plus seal off unused rooms.

“Set your temperature on your thermostat at 68 degrees,” Communications Manager Joey Lee explained. “I know that seems a little chilly but put on an extra sweater and wrap up in a blanket because any degree higher than 68 can raise your energy bill by about three percent.”

With the type of conditions coming our way Entergy adds the weight of ice and heavy winds could easily snap sending active power lines to the ground. They want everyone to be on guard.

“In their yards cleaning up, we see that happen a lot after storms when trees go down and people go out in their yards,” Lee added. “Take extra precaution and make sure there are no extra lines in the debris.”

All outages should be reported immediately to Entergy by calling 1-800-9-Outage. Entergy will have most on-call employees standing by from home where they can be closer to customers in need.

Remember if you’re using space heaters it becomes a fire hazard if you have more than one plugged into outlets or extension cords or near flammable objects unattended.","As many look to hunker down with plenty of food, Entergy says you should be on the lookout for power lines and poles going down.

114,"Feb 15, 2021",Houston Chronicle,"Harris County hustles to distribute 8,400 COVID-19 vaccines after freezer loses power","Harris County public health officials hustled to distribute thousands of doses of the COVID-19 vaccine after the facility storing them lost power Monday when record-cold temperatures strained the power grid, County Judge Lina Hidalgo said.

Harris County Public Health distributed the doses to Rice University, the county jail and Houston Methodist, Ben Taub and Lyndon B. Johnson hospitals.

The public health department made the decision to offer vaccines to places where there were lots of people already congregated and had the medical staff to distribute the vaccine, Hidalgo said.

The county’s storage facility lost power around 2 a.m. Monday morning and its backup generator failed, forcing the county to improvise a plan to distribute 8,500 doses before they spoiled. All are of the Moderna vaccine, which must be kept between minus 13 and 5 degrees Fahrenheit.

As of Monday afternoon, more than 1.2 million customers were without power because of the winter storm or manual outages by CenterPoint Energy to reduce load on the electric grid, Mayor Sylvester Turner said.

The county distributed 5,410 vaccines to other providers, Hidalgo spokesman Rafael Lemaitre said. The rest, county leaders realized after consulting with Moderna, could be saved for future use.

“The vaccine supply we thought we were going to lose in a few hours, we could actually re-refrigerate and administer (those) later to our wait list,” Hidalgo said.

Houston Methodist received 1,000 doses Monday morning, spokeswoman Stephanie Asin said.

“We administered them in under three hours,” she said. “We didn’t waste one drop.”

Rice University was given 1,000 doses, available at the East Gym to anyone on campus until 5 p.m., a spokesman said, and scores of people lined up for the shots.

The county jail received about 3,000 doses, Harris County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Jason Spencer said.

“We were contacted by Harris County Public Health,” Spencer said. “They said they had vaccines available that they needed to use quickly because they were concerned the refrigeration they used may not have held up overnight and they felt the clock was ticking.”

The department sent word to detention officers and patrol officers they had until early afternoon to go down to the jail and get it, he said.

“We also knew there would probably not be enough employee demand, or that it wasn’t likely, so they have started offering to people in the jail to make sure the vaccine doesn’t go to waste,” Spencer said.

Texas Jail Project executive Krish Gundu said inoculating inmates makes sense, given that social distancing is difficult inside detention facilities.

“We hope this will not only slow down the spread of the virus inside the jail but also make the entire Harris County community safer,” Gundu said. “Ideally, we should also be depopulating the jail to allow for physical distancing inside cells.”

The doses were not available to the general public, said county officials, who discouraged residents from attempting to travel on icy roads in hopes of receiving a dose.

The county shut down its vaccination sites Monday through Wednesday because of the harsh winter weather.

""There's still leaking water under this house, there's leaking water next door ... the pressure is wrong.""The problem for Sublett, his nextdoor neighbor Freddie Alexander, as well as other neighbors in the surrounding few blocks is that their landlord, J.

A check of the Harris County Appraisal records show Batteau owns at least 15 houses in the area. He told Eyewitness News the count was 20.""They are out to get me because they burned my house down,"" said Batteau, who is convinced that the water issues with some of his rental homes stem from tenants trying to attack him.In a rambling interview on Monday, Batteau, who has run for city council several times, not only accused unnamed tenants of burning down his house, but also said the people trying to help are covertly trying to take away his homes.""I'm never selling,"" he said, admitting he's reluctant to accept outside help.""I would hope Mr. Batteau stop the name slander,"" said Humi Jackson, a member of the Black United Fund of Texas.Jackson has been on the ground almost daily delivering water to homebound seniors renting from Batteau.

117,"Feb 16, 2021",WTVA,What to do if you're in the middle of a power outage,"Texas is colder than it's been in decades, one of at least 25 states under a winter weather advisory during this week's historic cold outbreak.

But as Texans scramble to stay warm, rolling power outages have begun across the state following high demand.

Millions of customers across the US have lost power, with much of those outages occurring in Texas. Power outages can be dangerous for those unprepared for such intense winter chill.

If you're among the Texans whose power has gone out or will go out at some point this week, here's what you need to know to stay warm and safe this week.

Stay home

Staying indoors is your best bet at staying safe during a winter power outage, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.

Stay off the roads if you can -- icy conditions could lead to car accidents. Just last week, at least nine people were killed in car crashes triggered by winter storms in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, including six who died in the 133-car pileup in Fort Worth.

Take stock of the essentials

In case the power outage lasts a few days, you should have the following on hand:

Extra food and water: A three- to seven-day supply is a good standard

Flashlight and extra batteries

Battery-powered radio

Extra medicine

First-aid supplies

If you need to make a trip outside, keep it as brief as you can, and layer up, the CDC says. Check with your local emergency authorities to make sure it's safe to drive or travel in the cold.

Stay warm

Layer up -- it's going to get cold. In extreme cold, the Houston Office of Emergency Management recommends wearing at least three layers of tops, plus an outer layer to block out wind, and two layers of bottoms. A hat, gloves and a warm face mask are musts, too.

The CDC recommends warming up with extra blankets, sleeping bags and winter coats.

It's not safe, though, to keep blankets and other flammable materials near alternate sources of warmth like a portable space heater. Keep the heaters in an area clear of flammable fabrics.

If you're using a fireplace, first make sure it's properly vented to the outside and won't leak gas into your home. You should keep it stocked with dry firewood -- not paper, the CDC says -- throughout the power outage.

To keep in heat, close blinds and curtains and shut doors to rooms to avoid ""wasting heat,"" the National Weather Service recommends. Stuffing towels in the cracks under doors can keep some of the chill out of your home, and eating and drinking throughout the power outage will help keep your body warm.

Keep your food & water supply safe

Avoid opening your fridge or freezer during the power outage to keep your food cold. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), a fridge can keep food cold during an outage for about four hours, and a freezer will keep its temperature for about 48 hours.

Fill coolers with ice, if necessary, to keep food from spoiling.

Some water purification systems may not function fully when the power goes out, the CDC warns. You can check with local officials to make sure your water is safe -- they should give you specific recommendations for treating water in your area.

Be careful of carbon monoxide

Generators can release poisonous carbon monoxide if you use them inside your home. If you're using one this week, keep it outside, about 20 feet away from your home, the CDC advises.

You should never use a gas stove or oven to heat your home, according to Ready.gov, the US government's online disaster planning resource.

If it's safe, go somewhere warm

If it's safe for you to travel to a shelter, be sure to wear a mask or layer two masks and bring extras in case your stay is extended. These locations should be well-ventilated, though social distancing is still advised, according to Ready.gov.

Know the signs of hypothermia

Babies, older adults and unhoused people are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. If you're worried about people in these groups, look for the signs: Confusion, shivering, difficult speaking, sleepiness and stiff muscles in adults, and bright red skin and low energy in babies, according to the CDC.

If you fear someone in your household has hypothermia, call for medical help. If they can't immediately arrive, try to warm them up yourself with blankets, food and water and an alternate heat source.

Conserve power if you still have it

Start by turning off and unplugging nonessential lights and appliances, and don't use large appliances like ovens or washing machines if you can avoid it, the Houston Office of Emergency Management suggests.

Turn down your thermostat to 68 degrees or lower -- if too many people crank up the heat, the demand could trigger another blackout.

During the day, if it's sunny, open your blinds so the sun can heat your home, but close them at night to prevent losing heat.

Check on your loved ones

When safe to do so, check in with the people around you to make sure they're OK.

Those who have medical equipment that require power, like respirators, should be taken to locations with generators or a friend's or neighbor's home that hasn't been impacted.

Keep your pets warm

Don't leave pets outside when it gets cold. Move them into a shelter inside where they'll stay warm, the Humane Society of the United States advises.

If you're walking your dog (though outdoor activity should be brief), consider wrapping them up in a sweater or coat -- pets can get hypothermia, too.

Look on your pet's paws for rock salt or other chemicals used to melt ice. Those chemicals can irritate your pet's feet, so wipe them down with a warm, damp towel upon returning home.

If you have a reptile or another pet that relies on outside sources of warmth, you can heat them up with hand warmers, a generator (again, used only outside your home) or snuggling, says PetCoach, an online veterinary database from Petco.","But as Texans scramble to stay warm, rolling power outages have begun across the state following high demand.

119,"Feb 18, 2021",Eater Portland,Why Did Fred Meyer Throw Out Thousands of Pounds of Food?,"On Tuesday, February 16, grocery workers and food rights activists stood off over the fate of multiple dumpsters full of food. After a Hollywood neighborhood grocery store threw out a massive amount of groceries following a power outage, activists attempted to save the food to redistribute it; instead, employees called the police, and a fierce argument has developed online surrounding the potential risk to vulnerable communities — either by choosing to distribute the food, or by choosing not to.

Like many other businesses and homes, the Hollywood Fred Meyer location lost power due to the snowstorms over Valentine’s Day weekend. After employees were directed to throw out thousands of food items like packaged meats and cheeses, milk, tofu, and juice, activists took to Twitter to alert the public about the available food. The Oregonian first reported that around 2:30 p.m., a number of local residents and activists showed up to salvage the still-intact food, only to be blocked by store employees. A tweet from Dr. Juniper Simonis, a local activist, showed a dumpster filled with thousands of pounds of food. Around 4 p.m., Portland Police officers responded to a 911 call from store employees, asking them to remove the individuals outside the store.

One such individual was Morgan Mckniff, who operates with Team Raccoon, a group that provided clean-ups for parks after the ongoing protests against police brutality, as well as respirators for protestors and families affected by police tear gas during last year’s summer. A former chef, Mckniff tells Eater that around a half a dumpster’s worth of food was successfully salvaged and redistributed; people brought food to food insecure Portlanders’ homes, volunteers dropped food in Portland’s many free fridges, and mutual aid kitchens prepared meals for those still without power. Mckniff said on Twitter that the team checked food temperatures and inspected items to evaluate whether it remained food-safe. “The point is that they didn’t even bother to check,” they say, referencing the Fred Meyer employees. “They just covered their asses and called the cops on the people who did show up to check.”

Fred Meyer, a chain founded in Portland and currently owned by grocery giant Kroger, remained quiet about the incident on Tuesday, but the following day issued a statement: “Unfortunately, due to loss of power at this store, some perishable food was no longer safe for donation to local hunger relief agencies. Our store team became concerned that area residents would consume the food and risk foodborne illness, and they engaged local law enforcement out of an abundance of caution. We apologize for the confusion.”

According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), food in freezers during an outage would remain safe for around 48 hours; food in refrigerators would last closer to four. Other items, including shelf-stable ones, would remain safe for longer. A spokesperson for Fred Meyer was able to confirm that the shop had lost power due to the storm, and that the outage had lasted 48 hours, though it was unclear if that was 48 hours before the disposal, or total; Fred Meyer’s spokesperson did not respond to emails with follow-up questions.

However, Fred Meyer did explain further to the Oregonian: According to them, Fred Meyer employees did reach out to food pantries to try to donate the food before the four hours had elapsed, but said the roads were too icy for pantries to actually access the store for pickup. The Oregonian says they confirmed that two pantries could not successfully reach the store to collect the groceries within the four-hour window.

In the last year — facing untold crises like the pandemic, wildfires, and most recently, catastrophic snowstorms — mutual aid groups, food shelters, and restaurants have worked to help alleviate hunger around the city and state. Many of them accept donated food from places that have lost power or otherwise been forced to close, including Blanchet House and Feed the Mass. Julie Showers, marketing and communications director for Blanchet House, says that the nonprofit often accepts food related to power outages; the team inspects the food to make sure it’s safe for consumption, and then repurposes it for use. “We rely on food donations to meet the need,” Shower says. “It’s also an incredible way to keep good food from going to waste.”

Some Twitter users have expressed concern that donating the food within the window would have put them at risk of a lawsuit. If Fred Meyer had chosen to donate the food when the power first went out, they would have been protected, in part, by the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act. The bill protects businesses from being liable when donating products in good faith. Mckniff tells Eater that they are aware of the bill, and even brought it up to Fred Meyer workers during the standoff. “It was a disgusting display of capitalism and property over people,” they say.

after not too long, the folks pulling food realized it would be helpful to open the doors, which from the looks of it, did help quite a lot.

and yes, those are boxes of frozen beef in the green dumpster

According to police, workers called the cops out of fear for their physical safety. A representative from Portland Police told Eater they responded to two 911 calls from a Fred Meyer manager, who was reportedly concerned about the size of the crowd, and said there were threats being levied at the workers.

Three officers remained on the scene for around an hour, during which a number of others, including trainees and their training officers, arrived. According to the PPB, at one point 11 police were on the scene for around 5 minutes. According to the police report, as well as witnesses on social media, the police vacated the area a little after 5 p.m.

Debate on social media regarding the safety of the food has raged on over the course of the day; some assert that the food could cause food poisoning throughout the unhoused community, while others say the food was obviously safe and showed no signs of spoilage. The heart of this debate comes out of an urge to help the one million Oregonians who are food insecure, a number that doubled in 2020. Fighting over food in a dumpster doesn’t begin to approach the larger problem: That food is something we have to fight over in the first place.

120,"Feb 20, 2021",USA Today,Texas' winter storm could make life worse for Black and Latino families hit hard by power outages,"CLOSE A winter storm that hammered the Southern Plains left millions without power. Here is one of those stories. USA TODAY

AUSTIN -- At the height of the storm that blasted Texas, Maria Benitez huddled in her Austin apartment with her husband and four teenage children, eating tuna out of a can and sipping on powdered milk. With no power, her apartment was dangerously cold and the family pulled on several pairs of pants and sweaters to keep warm.

Benitez's power and water returned Thursday, just as her fridge and cupboards grew bare. But now a new struggle begins: The storm kept her from cleaning homes all week and, as her family's sole wage earner, she's instantly behind on rent and utilities. Grocery donations from friends have helped. But those will run out soon.

""There are a lot of people who are still struggling,"" Benitez, 51, said. ""There are a lot of people who don’t have enough to eat, who don’t have enough blankets. This is not over.""

As millions of Texans grapple with the aftermath of a deadly winter storm, people of color and low-income communities who were disproportionately affected by blackouts and burst pipes could now face the hardest journey to recovery, experts said.

The historic winter weather exacerbated pre-existing disparities like poor infrastructure and lack of resources in marginalized communities. Black and Latino communities who were disproportionately hit by COVID-19 now must struggle to recover from one of the worst weather events to ever hit Texas. And previous disaster response failures indicate the situation may get worse as the state thaws out.

""What you will see, as with COVID-19 and with any disaster, is disproportionate death and negative impacts for those who are most vulnerable among us,"" said Chauncia Willis, chief executive of the Institute for Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management, an Atlanta-based non-profit focused on emergency management and racial justice. ""These inequities are easily identifiable before disaster and, of course, they’re rooted in systemic bias, racism and the country's anti-poverty mindset.""

Lower-income families may not be able to stock up on essentials ahead of the storm, have access to transportation in the event of an emergency or afford precautions like renters or flood insurance, leaving them vulnerable when disaster strikes, Willis said.

Power outages numbered about 139,000 in Texas by Friday, down from a high of 4 million earlier in the week. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has deployed generators, blankets and pallets of bottled water to Texans. Meanwhile, advocacy groups have been sheltering those in need and delivering meals and groceries to families who still can't find food, as grocery stores struggle to restock.

The Austin Justice Coalition delivered food to more than 40 families around Austin who had run out of food, said João Paulo Connolly, the group's director of housing and community development. Around 90% of those families were Black or Latino, he said.

The storm hit families of all races and ethnicities and knocked out power even in affluent neighborhoods, Connolly said. But families of color in lower-income areas often don't have a car or the funds to hunt for groceries or make quick repairs on busted pipes, he said. Thus, it'll take them longer to recover from the disaster, he said.

""Everyone’s out of food and having a hard time getting to the store,"" Connolly said. ""It's just a general mess.""

Storm tracker: As winter storm moves into Northeast, Texans are now grappling with lack of safe drinking water

In Houston, the frigid temperatures and outages created a citywide water crisis. As power gets restored and drinkable water returns to homes, county officials are studying how best to help residents and use federal funds to restore neighborhoods.

County Commissioner Rodney Ellis, whose district is 70% Black and Hispanic, said he hopes communities of color get equitable disaster relief. During the disaster response following 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which flooded most of Houston, more affluent communities often benefited more from federal disaster funds than communities of color -- something he'd like to reverse following this event, he said.

""Often time in government, we don’t do things with that equity lens,"" he said. ""I'm worried about communities of color being disproportionately impacted.""

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas directed utility companies to implement outages to compensate for the increased demand in electricity and disrupted supply, according to Varun Rai, director of the University of Texas-Austin's Energy Institute.

Utility companies prioritized keeping the power on in downtown areas that include critical service providers such as hospitals and nursing homes, which benefited residents in the typically densely populated, wealthier neighborhoods nearby, he said.

Lower-income families typically live farther from these areas, meaning they were less likely to have power during planned outages, Rai said.

""Even when you’re not in emergency situations, like we are today, it takes much longer and it's much harder for many communities to get access,"" he said.

This stark contrast was highlighted in photos taken in Austin that show the downtown area glaringly bright while hundreds of thousands of homes, particularly in East Austin, the city's historically Black and Hispanic neighborhood, were without power.

The increased demand for electricity will likely mean electric bills will go up, Rai said, another blow to lower-income households that already spend a higher percentage of their income on utilities.

Although electricity is back on for many Texans, the crisis is not over due to the lack of safe drinking water in many areas. Seven million Texans must boil their tap water before drinking it because record low temperatures damaged infrastructure and pipes.

Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican,warned that residents ""are not out of the woods,"" with temperatures still well below freezing statewide and disruptions in food supply chains. Abbott urged residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

'Just crippling': Texans devastated by ice storm are now hunting empty shelves for food and water

Rai said fixing water infrastructure and potentially winterizing it will be costly and the burden may fall on consumers through taxes orhigherutility bills which ""could hurt these communities in a different way.""

President Joe Biden, who plans to visit Texas next week, said he has offered additional support from the federal government to state and local agencies.

Federal emergency officials sent generators to support water treatment plants, hospitals and nursing homes in Texas, along with thousands of blankets and ready-to-eat meals, officials said.

However, advocates said federal aid is often not distributed equitably to the communities who need it most.

Researchers from Rice University in Houston and the University of Pittsburgh found post-disaster assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is distributed unevenly and white communities see higher levels of reinvestment post-disaster.

This caused wealth inequality between white communities and communities of color to increase dramatically in the aftermath of natural disasters in Texas like Hurricane Harvey and across the country, according to a 2018 study.

When disaster strikes, the federal government gives aid based on racialized estimates of worth and federal aid must be matched by states, communities and, in some cases, individuals, according to study author Junia Howell, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in racial and socioeconomic inequality. This ultimately results in poorer communities getting fewer resources and white communities getting more, she said.

'It's been emotionally exhausting': They have chronic illnesses. Then, the power went out in Texas.

“So many Black and brown communities that are the predominant population of their whole county, especially rural counties, they do not have the resources and the infrastructure often to match federal aid, so they don’t get it,” she said. “White communities, and particularly white middle and upper-class people, win out over and over and over.”

Howell said unless changes are made in the aid process, the recovery period will have long-term negative economic and health impacts on communities of color.

“That is where the real disaster I think it’s going to take place,” she said. “I’m not super hopeful that this recovery is going to come out in a way that is more equitable than past recoveries.”

Benitez, the Austin mother, said she really began to worry as the temperature plummeted and she started running out of food for her children.

But the immediate future is equally scary. She doesn't know when she'll be able to clean homes again and the bills are piling up. She borrowed money from her sister to cover this month's rent. Beyond that, she's not sure what will happen.

""It's going to be tough,"" Benitez said.

121,"Mar 15, 2021",WJTV,Cool Schools: Wingfield High School helps community during water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Wingfield High School came together to help the community during the water crisis.

The thought of students without water kept Wingfield High School Graduation Coach, Fredrick Connors, up at night.

“I could not sleep knowing that our scholars were in that type of situation,” said Connors.

So Connors took initiative. He asked teachers and staff members if they wanted to donate their own money to buy water and food for the students and community members. Together, they raised about $1200.

“We have given away about 20 pallets of water,” said Connors, “Which equates to maybe two thousand cases of water.”

Connors and Wingfield High School staff members held about four events. Not only did they give out water, but food too.

“Because of the outage of electricity most of the food people had perished,” said Connors, “They needed food.”

Parents and students in need were so grateful. They left a mark on Connors.

“It was so rewarding it makes me tear up,” said Connors, “We really care wholeheartedly and that is what we do.”

Wingfield High School Principal, Roderick Smith, said having staff members who care about their students is the key to their success. He also thanked Connor’s for taking the initiative to create the drives.

“I have to give credit where credit is due,” said Smith, “Mister Connors had the vision and he has been working it out ever since.”

Connors said he could not have done it without the other staff members at Wingfield High School.

124,"Feb 19, 2021",PBS,Lights come back on in Texas as water woes rise in the South,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Broken water pipes brought on by record-low temperatures have created a shortage of clean drinking water, shut down airports on Friday and left hospitals scrambling.

Texas authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

And in Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said

WATCH: After brutalizing much of the U.S., storm surge shines a spotlight on disparities

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to drive to pick it up – leaving elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, is running out of his heart medication, with only enough to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to make it to the pharmacy to refill it.

“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after ice and snow storms swept through early in the week, forcing utilities from Minnesota to Texas to implement rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids.

Texas’ grid operators said Friday that the state’s electrical system returned to normal for the first time since a storm knocked out power to more than 4 million customers. Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now has enough capacity to provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure in the energy capital of the U.S., while ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages early Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 59 people, including a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond. A growing number of people have perished as they struggled to keep warm.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Abbott urged Texas residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect the system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was at “critically low” levels and also asked its customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building — causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tougued skunk lizard.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state’s water outages were in the northern part of the state and in the southwestern city of Lake Charles, which is struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas and with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Edwards said.

Edwards said he was grateful that warmer weather was forecasted across Louisiana by Saturday.

“I expect that over the next several days, we will make repairs to the water systems and get things functioning as close to normal as possible,” the governor said in a live event with the Washington Post.

In the community of Hackberry near Lake Charles, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and put up her two daughters in another home.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.

125,"Feb 18, 2021",Waco Tribune-Herald,Winter update: Rolling outages halted; food deliveries to Waco crimped,"The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has made significant progress overnight restoring customer power, although some outages still remain throughout the state.

Energy emergency conditions remain as the grid operator and transmission owners work to restore the remaining customers that are without power.

“We’re to the point in the load restoration where we are allowing transmission owners to bring back any load they can related to this load shed event,” said ERCOT Senior Director of System Operations Dan Woodfin. “We will keep working around the clock until every single customer has their power back on.”

Customers that remain without power likely fall into one of these three categories:

• Areas out due to ice storm damage on the distribution system

• Areas that were taken out of service due to the energy emergency load shed that need to be restored manually (i.e., sending a crew to the location to reenergize the line)

• Large industrial facilities that voluntarily went offline to help during this energy emergency

Transmission owners are assessing how many customers are affected at this time.

While there is no additional load shed occurring at this time, a little over 40,000 MW of generation remains on forced outage due to this winter weather event. Of that, 23,500 MW is thermal generation and the rest is wind and solar. It is possible that some level of rotating outages may be needed over the next couple of days to keep the grid stable.","The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has made significant progress overnight restoring customer power, although some outages still remain throughout the state.

While conservation efforts helped extend the water supply, the tanks ran dry overnight.”

AEP is assessing the outage and no time frame has been given on when power will be restored.

131,"Feb 18, 2021",PBS,Some power restored in Texas but water woes persist,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Power was restored to more homes and businesses in Texas on Thursday after a deadly blast of winter this week overwhelmed the electrical grid and left millions shivering in the cold. But the crisis was far from over, with many people still in need of safe drinking water.

Fewer than a half-million homes remained without electricity, although utility officials said limited rolling blackouts could still occur.

The storms also left more than 320,000 homes and businesses without power in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. About 70,000 power outages persisted after an ice storm in eastern Kentucky, while nearly 67,000 were without electricity in West Virginia.

Snow and ice moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the Northeast. Back-to-back storms left 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow in Little Rock, Arkansas, tying a 1918 record, the National Weather Service said.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of over three dozen people, some while trying to keep warm. In the Houston area, one family died from carbon monoxide as their car idled in their garage. A woman and her three grandchildren were killed in a fire that authorities said might have been caused by a fireplace they were using.

In Texas on Thursday, just under 500,000 homes and businesses remained without power, down from about 3 million a day earlier. The state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the remaining outages are largely weather-related, rather than forced blackouts that began Monday to stabilize the power grid.

“We will keep working around the clock until every single customer has their power back on,” said ERCOT Senior Director of System Operations Dan Woodfin.

WATCH: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott gives update on state response to winter power outages

Woodfin warned that rotating outages could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, though they wouldn’t last as long as outages earlier this week.

Adding to the state’s misery, the weather jeopardized drinking water systems. Authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it, following record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and pipes.

Water pressure fell after lines froze, and many people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing over, said Toby Baker, executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Gov. Greg Abbott urged residents to shut off water to their homes, if possible, to prevent more busted pipes and preserve pressure in municipal systems.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he expects that residents in the nation’s fourth-largest city will have to boil tap water before drinking it until Sunday or Monday.

Some Austin hospitals lost water pressure and heat. But because the problem was statewide and affected other facilities, “no one hospital currently has the capacity to accept transport of a large number of patients,” said David Huffstutler, CEO of St. David’s South Austin Medical Center.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water but still treated patients, with most non-emergency surgeries and procedures canceled for Thursday and possibly Friday, and burst pipes were repaired as they happened, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Emergency rooms were crowded “due to patients being unable to meet their medical needs at home without electricity,” Smith said.

Texas Children’s Hospital’s main campus at the Texas Medical Center and another location had low water pressure, but the system was adequately staffed and patients had enough water and “are safe and comfortable,” spokeswoman Jenn Jacome said.

FEMA sent generators to support water treatment plants, hospitals and nursing homes in Texas, along with thousands of blankets and ready-to-eat meals, officials said. The Texas Restaurant Association also said it was coordinating donations of food to hospitals.

Weather-related outages also hit Oregon, where some have been without power for nearly a week. A Portland supermarket threw perishable food into the trash, leading to a clash between scavengers and police.

The damage to the power system was the worst in 40 years, said Maria Pope, CEO of Portland General Electric. At the peak of the storm, more than 350,000 customers in the Portland area were in the dark, and more than 100,000 Oregon customers remained without power Thursday.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas implemented rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states from the Dakotas to the Texas Panhandle, said rolling blackouts were no longer needed, but it asked customers to conserve energy until at least 10 p.m. Saturday.

The weather also disrupted water systems in several Southern cities, including New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana, where fire trucks delivered water to hospitals and bottled water was brought in for patients and staff, Shreveport television station KSLA reported.

Power was cut to a New Orleans facility that pumps drinking water from the Mississippi River. A spokeswoman for the Sewerage and Water Board said on-site generators were used until electricity was restored.

Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt pleaded with residents to limit water usage, and Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said most customers were without water, with no timeline on when it would be restored. At least 19,000 residents were without power there.

As the storms marched east, 12 people had to be rescued Wednesday night from boats after a dock weighed down by snow and ice collapsed on Tennessee’s Cumberland River, the Nashville Fire Department said. Elsewhere in the state, a 9-year-old boy was killed when the tube his father was pulling behind an ATV slammed into a mailbox.

A 69-year-old Arkansas man was found dead Wednesday after falling into a frozen pond while trying to rescue a calf. In Kentucky, a 77-year-old woman was found dead of likely hypothermia Wednesday night after two days without power and heat.

A man fell through the ice on the Detroit River on Wednesday night and likely drowned, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. The man walked onto the ice just off Belle Isle, Michigan, about 5 p.m. and began “jumping up and down,” Lt. Jeremiah Schiessel said. Crews were unable to reach the spot where the man was last seen because the ice was too thin, Schiessel said.

Before the wintry weather moved on, parts of Texas got more snow.

Del Rio, along the U.S.-Mexico border, got nearly 10 inches (25.4 cm) Thursday, surpassing the city’s one-day record for snowfall. City officials asked residents to conserve electricity.

Up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) were forecast for San Antonio, and Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to stay off treacherous roads.

132,"Feb 17, 2021",Houston Chronicle,"Houston sees long lines, limited supply of water and other essentials","Alexandria Hampton got a rude welcome to Houston.

In her first week living in the city, severe winter weather left Hampton without water pressure in her Sharpstown home Wednesday, necessitating an early-morning grocery trip.

After striking out at a Meyerland Wal-Mart, Hampton found an open Food Town on the city’s southwest side and jumped in line with a few dozen other shoppers. Once inside, the selection left the South Carolina native pleasantly surprised, with plenty of bottled water — limit two multi-packs per shopper — and canned foods.

“I might have been all-in-all 25 minutes in line, but it meant I was able to get what I needed,” said Hampton, 24, whose home still had power. “I know to keep batteries and candles and that type of thing, so it wasn’t that bad yet.”

Hampton was among many residents across Houston who headed to grocery stores, hardware outlets, gas stations and other retailers Wednesday as they braced for a third day of power outages and boil-water advisories throughout the region.

While temperatures remained in the 30s and rain fell, the thaw gave many the chance to look for stores with critically-needed supplies. Many of the open retailers had limited hours and were restricting the number of customers allowed inside at one time.

Dozens waited outside the Lowe’s near Interstate 610 and Ella Boulevard in the Heights, where employees limited entry. As one man tugging a cart of several 10-foot pipes left, a couple ambled in looking for five five-gallon buckets.

Ronald Berard, 75, showed up just as the rain intensified and found about 60 people waiting in front of him. He just needed fuel for a propane torch to repair piping near his washing machine, which gave way and required him to shut off all water in his Denver Harbor home.

“If I have to call a plumber, they are not going to come anytime soon,” Berard said.

Coleman McCord, 31, joined Berard among the huddled masses after a pipe burst in his Heights home Tuesday evening. After immediately shutting off his water and waiting out the cold night, McCord hoped some epoxy — if he could find it — would seal the pipe and stop further damage.

While others lobbed accusations against politicians and energy companies, McCord said he was focused on his house and fixing his pipes.

“Of course you are frustrated, but it is a little too early for throwing stones,” McCord said. “I’ll leave that stuff to the politicians and they can keep it.”

Five miles to the southwest of the Lowe’s, Kevin Keith idled with a quarter-tank of gas in an Exxon line that bled into a long queue at a McDonald’s drive-thru. Keith, 45, chalked up the traffic to Houston’s semi-improved weather.

“This is just crazy,” Keith said. “Everyone got up, looked outside, and went for it.”

Keith’s wait was for naught, as the station ran out of fuel. Inside, though, business was brisk even as cases of water ran out and the soda machine went offline due to the city’s boil water advisory.

Richard Judson snagged what might have been the last quart of milk — others were making due with armloads of eight-ounce bottles — along with two bags of powdered doughnuts, two one-liter bottles of water, a Styrofoam cooler and four bottles of wine.

“It’s an off-day,” Judson, 53, said. “What’s better than wine by candlelight?”

Back in southwest Houston, customers at a Fiesta Mart found minimal lines when they arrived about 9 a.m. Within an hour, about 50 people snaked around the corner of the store.

At 10:30 a.m., pallets of bottled water remained in front of the store, with a sign limiting customers to four packages.

Jamie Saldana, 62, found limits on other items. He tried to snag a large case of Duraflame starter logs for his fireplace, but a store employee told him to put back all but two boxes.

“Our power is coming on and off, but I’ve got a fireplace that’s keeping us warm,” Saldana said as he loaded three cases of bottled water into his white Chevy Silverado. “I’m hoping by tomorrow that all this stuff goes away. I’m stocked up for another two or three days, though.”

While most stores welcomed customers in the morning, H-E-B’s Central Market near the Galleria did not open until noon. As the top of the hour approached, dozens of people wrapped around the front and side of the building, many holding umbrellas to protect from rain.

After spending three days without power at their Upper Kirby home and eating through their stash of bread and water, Yani Pavlidis and his wife needed more food.

“It caught me by surprise, totally,” Pavlidis, 56, said.

Later Wednesday, dueling lines formed in the Greater East End at adjacent spots with power, a Shell station and La Michoacana Meat Market, in a mostly electricity-free neighborhood.

Greg Arce’s venture for an open gas station took him from Pasadena, where he found nothing, to the eastside Shell. His tank was nearly empty as he sat two cars away from a gas pump.

“There’s a lot of people — and there’s no gas,” Arce said. “We don’t want to run out.”

At La Michoacana, employee Phillip Avalos was tasked with corralling a crowd that stretched out the door.

“Some people don’t want to wait,” Avalos said, but for the most part, “everybody has been nice and calm.”

133,"Feb 17, 2021",E&E News,"ELECTRICITY: Blackout crisis: Fallout, furor and fact checks","Fallout from sweeping winter power outages echoed from Texas to the White House yesterday, as power restoration updates commingled with partisan arguments about whether to blame renewables or fossil fuels.

Texas, the nation's leading oil and gas producer, was the hardest-hit state — over 3 million homes and businesses there still lacked electricity as of last night — and politicians rushed to shape the energy policy debate encircling the crisis.

The disaster didn't stop people from criticizing Texas Republicans — just as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) last year slammed California Democrats over blackouts in that state. And some conservative groups sought to tie the debacle to President Biden's push for clean energy and the Green New Deal, which Biden did not embrace, though neither was a factor in Texas' problems.

Advocates for a number of energy sources, from coal to wind, meanwhile, sparred over the grid disaster as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corp. announced they intend to launch a joint inquiry into the bulk-power system.

With pressure mounting, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) announced yesterday that reforming his state's main power grid operator will be an emergency item for state lawmakers to tackle in the current legislative session. Abbott told Houston TV station ABC13 that leaders of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) should resign because they knew about the severity of the power shortages but withheld the information from him and the public.

But no quick fix looms to make electricity networks in Texas or elsewhere immune to major power outages, whose apocalyptic effects in subfreezing temperatures this week added to the disruption already caused by COVID-19.

""We understood that pandemics were possible or that power outages were possible,"" said Cal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University in Texas. ""And we didn't do the preparation, because we took it to be too expensive.""

The future of electricity is taking on added importance under Biden, who has called for decarbonizing the U.S. power sector by 2035. Yesterday, the president called Abbott and six other governors in the path of the storm to discuss the extreme weather. The White House said Biden told the governors his administration is prepared to help and is ready to respond to requests for federal assistance.

A few grid operators have seen tight conditions and controlled service interruptions this week, including the Southwest Power Pool and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which collectively cover all or part of 20 U.S. states.

But it's ERCOT, the independent system operator for much of Texas, that's being hammered for managing a system that put people out of power for hours or even days in very cold weather.

ERCOT has pointed to the extreme cold as causing the supply shortfall, noting limited natural gas supplies, frozen plant instrumentation lines and frozen turbines. It said yesterday afternoon that nearly 30,000 megawatts of thermal generation — such as coal, gas and nuclear — was offline due to the winter storm, versus about 16,000 MW of renewables led by wind energy.

Commentators offered a deluge of opinions yesterday, from issuing calls to integrate Texas' grid into the broader U.S. electrical system to suggesting that policymakers scrutinize generation from wind, solar or natural gas resources. The Texas power sector also faces questions about a lack of adequate weatherization at power plants.

Former Energy Secretary Rick Perry used Tucker Carlson's Fox News show this week to highlight wind turbine outages and say there needs to be a role for fossil fuels as part of a diverse energy supply. Perry was the Republican governor when Texas pushed ahead with a roughly $7 billion plan to boost transmission that aided wind development.

""Fast-forward 10 years, and everything is solar, everything is wind and you have this type of event. ... If you don't have power to keep you warm ... you're going to die,"" Perry told Carlson. ""I mean, there are countless lives that could be lost with this type of reckless adhering to a philosophy that, quite frankly, is not scientific.""

Various commenters online falsely singled out wind for causing the Texas outages. And Sid Miller, Texas' Republican agriculture commissioner, declared on Facebook: ""We should never build another wind turbine in Texas.""

The American Clean Power Association, which promotes renewables, issued a rebuke to critics yesterday about Texas power outages and said much of the offline generation was tied to gas and coal.

""It is an extreme weather problem, not a clean power problem,"" Heather Zichal, the group's CEO, said in a statement. ""If anything, it shows why we need to be investing in building out more renewable energy sources with better transmission and storage to replace outdated systems."" Others said that climate change could make similar events more likely, meaning that more fossil fuels need to be curtailed.

In a blog post, the Sustainable FERC Project cited three factors at play in Texas — ""gas power plants are fragile, grid planners need to plan for increasingly extreme weather events, and the state's electrical independence comes at a price."" It called for more responsiveness and adaptability in the entire system.

""Whether it's hurricanes or flooding or an arctic blast of cold, we can expect more extremes,"" the group said.

White House and FERC

White House press secretary Jen Psaki deferred a question on whether the Biden administration is looking into pulling Texas into the national power grid, noting that Biden is now concentrating on the storm.

""Our focus right now is ensuring that the millions of people across Texas who were impacted by the storm get the relief they need,"" Psaki said, adding that ""as there are investments in the future in energy ... across the country, they'll need to plan for inclement weather, but I think that's a discussion and conversation that's a little bit down the road.""

In response to the ongoing emergency, Democratic Commissioner Allison Clements said FERC is monitoring the situation closely but that it's too early to say what actions the commission might take.

""We need to wait until we understand the specifics of what took place and until we get the power back on to decide next steps,"" she told E&E News.

But Clements said blaming one fuel source or another is ""not productive.""

Tony Clark, a Republican former FERC commissioner appointed by former President Obama in 2012, said FERC should revive an inquiry into grid resilience that's been pending at the commission since 2018.

""FERC is going to have to look really hard at ramping up that resilience docket that's been wandering around for several years and get serious about exploring this idea,"" he said.

FERC launched the inquiry after rejecting a DOE bid led by Perry to subsidize coal and nuclear power plants. After California suffered rolling blackouts last summer, coal advocates and some lawmakers have urged the commission to pick up the resilience docket in an effort to support the fossil fuel (Energywire, Nov. 19, 2020).

Clark said the nation's power system has a long way to go before it can safely retire fossil fuel resources and advocated for research and development funding into carbon capture technology and advanced climate modeling.

""You need diverse resources on the system,"" he said. ""Then you also have to be serious about putting money into carbon sequestration so you can make those types of plants fit into a more carbon-constrained world.""

John Rogers, a senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, pushed back on the idea that the issue is portfolio diversity.

""For example, many power plants, including all nuclear plants, virtually all coal plants, and a lot of natural gas plants, depend on water to cool the steam that drives the electricity-producing turbines,"" he wrote in a blog post yesterday.

""Any power plant dependent on cooling water will run into trouble if that cooling water is actually frozen solid,"" he said.

Wind debate

Crenshaw, the Texas congressman, was ridiculed on Twitter yesterday by Kenneth Russell DeGraff, a senior policy adviser to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) who mockingly asked Amazon.com's Alexa to ""tell me how many gigawatts of fossil fuels are out of commission in Texas.""

Crenshaw fired back on Twitter, saying ""over-subsidized wind energy and under-investment in gas power"" meant there wasn't enough baseload power. He also said Texas infrastructure wasn't ""designed for once-in-a-century freezes.""

""I'll be joining my Texas colleagues in getting to the bottom of what happened,"" Crenshaw said. ""We can do better, even for once in a century events.""

Frozen wind turbines were just one of several factors that compelled grid operators to institute planned blackouts as demand for heat and power exceeded the available supply, energy analysts said.

In addition to ice forming on wind turbine blades, equipment froze at nuclear power plants, coal plants became inoperable due to extreme cold, and solar panels covered in snow were unable to generate electricity, said Michael Webber, a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas, Austin.

Natural gas power plants, which are the largest electricity source in the main Texas power region, appeared to be the most severely affected by the weather conditions, Webber said. Many plants experienced equipment failures and supply shortages as subfreezing temperatures have made it difficult to obtain gas from wells, he said.

""When you pull gas out of the ground, it comes up with oil, gas and water,"" Webber said. ""So the water will freeze and choke off the wells, and you can't get the gas into pipelines.""

Another factor impeding gas delivery was that natural gas pipelines froze in the cold, said Jesse Jenkins, an assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University. Of all the factors that caused the power outages, ice on wind turbines was ""second order by far,"" Jenkins said in a Twitter thread about the ongoing electric grid challenges.

Nonetheless, the incidents affecting the Texas power grid highlight issues that will continue to occur as more renewable generation is added to the electric grid, said Ed Crooks, vice chairman of Americas at Wood Mackenzie.

""The resilience of generation, transmission and distribution equipment, and the design of the electricity market, will become even more important to cope with the challenges created by a renewables-heavy grid,"" Crooks said in a statement.

The crisis also raises questions about whether wind energy companies and grid operators in the United States should better prepare as the climate changes, according to researchers who study turbine blades.

When ice forms on turbines, it significantly reduces their ability to generate electricity. It also creates safety hazards for workers nearby and can cause the entire system to fail, said Kripa Varanasi, a professor of mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In the United States, wind farms are usually preemptively shut off when ice forms, a cheaper option than investing in de-icing materials, Varanasi said. But in Canada and Northern Europe, heating elements are often integrated into wind turbine designs to prevent the buildup of ice, which occurs more frequently in those climates, he said.

If icing on turbines continues to be a problem in some U.S. regions, wind companies could consider investing in surface treatments that can be sprayed onto turbines as a cheaper alternative to integrating de-icing technologies into the blades, Varanasi said.

""I think more recently, the storms now in Texas and so on are bringing this to light,"" he said.

Nuclear, coal, solar

Sean Gallagher, vice president of state and regulatory affairs for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said ERCOT data showed that Texas' solar capacity had performed well. He said energy efficiency and renewables, including rooftop solar with battery storage, can help reduce impacts of future events.

""What's happening in Texas and other parts of the country is terrible, and underscores the need for significant grid upgrades,"" Gallagher said in a statement.

Matt Crozat, senior director for policy development at the Nuclear Energy Institute, said efforts should continue to build a grid that is carbon-free as well as affordable, resilient and reliable.

""That means we will need markets and public policies that encourage the firm sources of electricity that can perform during trying conditions, such as nuclear energy or long-term storage or fossil fuel with carbon capture,"" he said in a statement.

Nuclear power did have some issues in Texas during the cold snap. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission showed a unit at the South Texas Project at 0% power in a report yesterday morning, and a spokesperson for the plant said its outage was related to cold weather.

But Crozat said that the U.S. nuclear fleet has operated at a 94% capacity factor over the last few days.

Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of a pro-coal group called America's Power, said the power emergencies in Texas and other places ""are another stark reminder"" of the need for an all-of-the-above energy strategy that includes coal to have a reliable and affordable power supply.

""Unless we act with a sense of urgency, these electricity shortages could become more common place because of the shutdown of coal-fired generating units,"" she said in a statement.

Lanny Nickell, chief operating officer of the Southwest Power Pool, which manages the grid across a swath of the central United States, said wind generators supplied about 10% to 12% of the peak demand yesterday in line with forecasts. An inadequate supply of natural gas to fuel generators ""has been an issue for us,"" he added.

But Nickell sidestepped the issue of renewable energy's reliability in the emergency, replying, ""That is a question that is going to be asked and hopefully answered in the future.""

Texas fallout

The cold snap continued to topple weather records yesterday. The temperature at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport fell to minus 2 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the National Weather Service. And cold weather is forecast to remain in Texas this week, though some warming is expected.

Power outages knocked out a water treatment plant in Fort Worth. And at least three deaths in Houston were linked to the extreme cold, Police Chief Art Acevedo said. Several other deaths were reported around the state, and officials in coastal Galveston were looking for a refrigerated truck to store bodies.

""Far too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather,"" Abbott, who has been governor since early 2015, said in a statement.

Abbott appoints the three members of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which plays a major role in overseeing ERCOT.

The governor yesterday signaled a need to look at the preparations and decisions by ERCOT to get a full picture of what caused the problem and to look toward long-term solutions. Abbott said he would work with state lawmakers to enhance the grid and ensure that power outages like this don't happen again.

Bill Magness, ERCOT's president and CEO, welcomed the examination and pledged to cooperate during a call with reporters.

The political fallout from the cold snap and the power outages built across the state, as did public anger. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, a longtime Democrat, said he had fielded calls from people questioning why downtown buildings hadn't dimmed their lights to conserve power.

Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, also a Democrat, said in a Twitter post that he was ""as frustrated as everyone else.""

""These power outages are unacceptable, and ERCOT needs to answer for them,"" he wrote.

State House Speaker Dade Phelan (R) called for two legislative committees to hold a joint hearing next week.

""We must cut through the finger-pointing and hear directly from stakeholders about the factors that contributed to generation staying down at a time when families needed it most,"" Phelan said in a statement.

U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat who represents parts of Houston, said she has spoken to DOE about solutions to Texas power shortages. She said she may sponsor legislation to fund more interconnections between Texas' largely isolated grid and neighboring power systems.

""We're doing far worse than any other state in the country that's experiencing this right now,"" she said.

Texas outages also are reigniting a conversation around energy equity.

Low-income communities and communities of color are often saddled with higher energy bills as a percentage of their income and are more vulnerable to blackouts, according to Christina Bowman, who helped launch the Clean Energy for Low Income Communities Accelerator program at DOE under Obama.

Bowman, now senior manager for the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, said the situation in Texas is indicative of how the ""fossil fuel system"" harms marginalized communities.

""Low-income households live in older, less efficient homes that tend to be leakier,"" she said. ""And when you're in a storm and there are these grid failures, these households are getting left out in the cold, so to speak.""

Andrew Mitcham, mayor of the suburban community of Jersey Village near Houston, said the power outages aren't a partisan issue, but the state's politicians share some of the blame for undermining local governments' authority.

""We have a Legislature and leadership that constantly attacks local government, constantly cuts our ability to raise revenue in a responsible manner,"" he said. ""It's frustrating as a local official, because when things like this happen, we're the people on the ground meeting face-to-face with citizens.""

Klump reported from Houston and Lee from Fort Worth. Reporters Arianna Skibell, Miranda Willson, Peter Behr and Carlos Anchondo and the Associated Press contributed.","The Texas power sector also faces questions about a lack of adequate weatherization at power plants.
FERC launched the inquiry after rejecting a DOE bid led by Perry to subsidize coal and nuclear power plants.
Crenshaw fired back on Twitter, saying ""over-subsidized wind energy and under-investment in gas power"" meant there wasn't enough baseload power.
Natural gas power plants, which are the largest electricity source in the main Texas power region, appeared to be the most severely affected by the weather conditions, Webber said.
The political fallout from the cold snap and the power outages built across the state, as did public anger."
134,"Feb 18, 2021",WJTV,"Crews work to repair pipes, power lines in Vicksburg","VICKSBURG, Miss. (WJTV) – A lack of running water and power outages are the top two problems left by this week’s ice storm in Warren County and Vicksburg. Public works crews had to wait until Thursday morning to find out where the major water main breaks were in the city.

As far as Entergy Mississippi customers go, more than 6,200 homes and businesses were without power on Thursday. Running water is slowly coming back for homeowners in some areas in Vicksburg.

Crews were able to find one of the water main breaks at the Vicksburg Forest Production Yard, where the fire prevention system came loose. Water gushed out of the ceilings, pipes and walls in several buildings.

“If anyone in the City of Vicksburg sees any amount of water leaking from a City street or City water main, please report it to me immediately by calling my cell phone — 601.942.0492. These unidentified leaks are causing our water pressure to remain low across the City,” said Mayor George Flaggs.

Ice also weighted down electrical wires in the city and county. It forced neighbors to turn to canned foods and boxed snacks all day, while wearing layers inside their homes. Most lost power Wednesday evening.

“I left the house going to get some gas cans filled up to power the generator. The roads were a little better than they were yesterday, so I’m getting out and about. Power went out yesterday afternoon, so I got gas logs fireplace which are heating pretty good. So we’re cooking on a grill outside,” said Paul Harbin, who lives in Warren County.

For the third time this week, Interstate 20 came to a standstill in the westbound lanes, backing up traffic for more than six miles.","(WJTV) – A lack of running water and power outages are the top two problems left by this week’s ice storm in Warren County and Vicksburg.

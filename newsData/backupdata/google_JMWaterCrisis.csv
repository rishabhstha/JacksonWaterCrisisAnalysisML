0,"Mar 2, 2021",NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis brings to light long-standing problems in city","After more than two weeks without clean running water, Katasha Johnson saw a slow trickle dribbling down a faucet in her home on the west side of Jackson, Mississippi, on Tuesday.

But the brown drip didn't feel like a reprieve for Johnson, 38, who lost water after back-to-back winter storms slammed the city and its century-old water infrastructure last month.

""It's not enough to do anything with, and it doesn't even look safe,"" said Johnson, the mother of children ages 9, 6 and 3.

Instead, Johnson and her fiancé are using melted snow and collected rainwater stored in four large coolers to flush the toilet. To clean dishes and hands, Johnson boils pots of water taken from a bathtub that was pre-filled when water was available.

""It has been absolutely horrible to live like this,"" she said.

Jackson has entered the third week of a crisis that has left much of the city without water since freezing temperatures devastated much of the South. Community leaders say that the disaster isn't a one-off and that it has brought to light long-simmering issues of systemic breakdown and neglect.

Weeks after the storm, the city continues to be under a boil water notice, and residents are being urged to conserve water and lower consumption as much as possible. Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city. Many say they have been turned away after supplies ran out.

Jackson reported 96 main water breaks and leaks, 53 of which have been repaired, the mayor's office said a statement.

""Today we saw pressure stay around 83 to 85 psi. This is good, but ultimately, we need to get to 90 psi and stay there consistently in order for water to be restored to everyone. This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the statement said.

More than half of the city's schools are closed because of the water crisis; only 19 of nearly 50 public schools have reopened.

While it's still unclear how many residents are out of water, community leaders, like state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, say it's at least 40,000.

Crudup has had no water for 16 days. He lives with his wife and two grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, in the hardest-hit part of the city, in South Jackson.

""We can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry. It's tremendously difficult,"" he said.

Crudup said that the city's infrastructure was already frail and that the crisis has highlighted how easily it can break.

""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,"" he said. ""This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable and co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative, a local nonprofit organization, said the water crisis has highlighted a slew of underlying issues long afflicting the community.

""This was a breakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens,"" she said. ""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people.""

Church as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Jackson's population is more than 80 percent Black.

Welchlin said the government hasn't invested in Jackson's infrastructure for a very long time.

""All of this is interconnected. Because of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see,"" she said.

Welchlin and Crudup said state and federal intervention is necessary to fully address not just infrastructure but all of the underlying issues connected to the crisis.

In the interim, several groups have stepped up to aid community members. The Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and other local organizations have coordinated supplies, water and services for residents in need. They have donated gift cards for food and bills and arranged for water trucks, and they have been dropping off cases of bottled water.

But many residents have also had to dip into their own pockets. Kehinde Gaynor, 42, has had to rent three hotel rooms in the last two weeks to give his wife and three children a place with safe water to bathe and wash.

Many residents have had to do that, he said, and the expenses have added up very quickly.

""Not having water isn't new to us. We've lost it before, but never as long as this,"" he said. ""It's affecting every part of our life, and to me it feels like we're the next Flint, Michigan.""","Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city.

JACKSON, Miss. – Two weeks into a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, after a series of winter storms, city officials say they do not know how many residents are still without water or when water will be restored.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Tuesday that there are still pockets of homes in south Jackson's high-elevation areas without water, but he could not share a total number of outages.

He said water pressure at the city's treatment plant was gradually being restored, but a firm date for restoration of the system remains elusive.

For more than two weeks, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.

Williams had said he was hopeful the system would be up to speed by Feb. 26, the weekend after the city first reported a water shortage on Feb. 17.

Instead, he said the prolonged freezing temperatures from winter storm systems crippled a system unequipped to deal with the temperature drop.

More than 100 water breaks reported

The system is still not putting out enough water pressure to service its more than 43,000 customers. That has been complicated by water main breaks across the city that have leaked water into city streets and yards. Since the city first reported a water shortage, more than 100 water breaks have been reported. As of Monday night, crews had completed 53 repairs, he said.

Williams said Tuesday that it's possible a large water main break that has not been reported is also siphoning water from the city's water supply.

""A hard number is difficult to track,"" Williams said. ""We would have to go door-to-door to know precisely where all the outages are.""

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has also been been hesitant to give a firm date for recovery of the water system.

The city has been tracking outages through reports from residents and its 311 hotline. The mayor's spokeswoman, Michelle Atoa said that as of Tuesday afternoon the hotline had received more than 1,500 water outage calls since Feb. 15, but she was unable to provide a hard number of residence outages or an estimate.

The mayor's office said in an email that it had crews out Tuesday in south Jackson neighborhoods and in higher elevated areas of the city where residents are still experiencing outages. The crews are testing pressure levels and releasing trapped air from hydrants that may be impeding flow.

3,"Mar 15, 2021",Slate,Ignore Mississippi’s Water Crisis at Your Own Peril,"For four weeks now, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have had no potable water. Even though repairs are underway for dozens of broken water mains and other equipment, the city’s 161,000 residents remain under a boil-water advisory, and hundreds still have no running water at all. The story is similar to ones we’ve heard before: thousands of mostly Black residents struggling to carry on without access to the most essential of necessities; a decades-old, multibillion-dollar water system in desperate need of major repair; proposed funding solutions that don’t go nearly far enough. But what separates Jackson from other ongoing municipal water crises nationwide, and worldwide, is its particular catalyst and the aftereffects.

The water crises that captured the most headlines in recent years were the result of governmental and corporate malpractice. Cities like Flint, Michigan—which is still grappling with lead-contaminated water—and Summerville, Georgia, saw their drinking water become unsafe after those in power tried to skirt regulations or save a few bucks. But Jackson was hit by a different kind of beast, one that threatens us all: a government unprepared to handle the effects of climate change and neglectful of the citizens who are most harmed by it.

The same storms that capsized Texas’ power grid in February also dumped unprecedented amounts of snow throughout the South. Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Mississippi all had energy or water stoppages, or both, as a result. Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting. In Jackson alone, about 80 water mains broke. But by late February, as safe water began flowing back to the hard-hit South, Jackson’s leaders kept pushing back their own projected deadlines for potable water restoration, and Gov. Tate Reeves briefly pondered a state takeover of the city’s water system. Though thousands of Texans are still struggling with their own busted pipes, its water treatment plants could at least resume operations following power restoration. In Jackson, the damage was even deeper.

Mississippi is the most impoverished state in the country; it’s also among the sickest and most publicly underfunded, with hospitals, schools, and other public services unable to properly serve residents, even when they aren’t being pummeled by storms. City workers tasked with repairing the water system have noted that some parts of it are a century old, and that the parts that aren’t nearly as ancient are quite brittle. The storms also directly maimed necessary equipment for the water treatment plants, hurting the purifying process even after power came back. The city’s O.B. Curtis Plant saw its intake screens freeze and raw water pumps malfunction while its feeder reservoir dropped in temperature. Drivers couldn’t deliver needed treatment chemicals to the plant for a while because of the icy, broken roads. Add that to a recent history of poor disaster management: In 2015, then–Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber declared two separate states of emergency for the city’s infrastructure, citing water mains and roads that were cracking under pressure from more mild winter weather. It was a unique order that could have spurred much-needed repairs, but the City Council overturned the second emergency order, and only a few fixes funded by state aid were eventually made in the following years. For this more recent disaster, it was only last week that the city signed off on a request to the state to provide $47 million for repairs.

Usually, water crises fueled by climate change are most visibly perceived in the form of droughts, groundwater depletion, sea level rise, or historic flooding. In Jackson, the water crisis stemmed from a bureaucratic infrastructure issue: the vulnerability of essential water treatment plants to unprecedented storms that are growing in frequency. In the same way Texas’ energy troubles demonstrated the need to mandate power grid winterization, Jackson’s emergency shows how our officials must work to protect the thing most of us take completely for granted. But that will also cost a lot of money and require major reform. If the Democratic-dominated federal government is already having issues figuring out national infrastructure priorities, the hard-right Mississippi Legislature certainly won’t fulfill its own state’s needs. More than likely, your city or state is facing similar woes.

These problems will play out first, though, in places struggling most with poverty and racism. Jackson’s population is 82 percent Black, and despite being the state’s capital and most populous metropolis, it suffers from a meager tax base, as its wealthier white residents fled the city in increasing numbers following the civil rights era; about a quarter of the city lives in poverty. Jackson’s Black leaders have long been aware of the issues plaguing their city and tried to do what they can to solve them, only to be rebuffed time and again by the mostly white and Republican state government. Climate change will only exacerbate such inequalities.

Not every American city has the same forces working against it as Jackson does, but the problems occurring there will also happen elsewhere. Many Americans have been lucky to have stable shelter, power, water, and protection against the coronavirus throughout the past year. But that’s all that is—luck. Unless governments take the appropriate response to heavily bolster our infrastructure and protect our most vulnerable, there’s no reason to think anybody will be so fortunate to escape unscathed the next time the storms come around. Jackson’s suffering residents know this all too well.","Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting.

You Can’t Wash.’ Water Crisis Hobbles Jackson, Miss., for Weeks","Mr. Reeves called in the National Guard last month to help distribute water and has hinted that the state might take over Jackson’s water system. His chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor’s office was helping the city explore securing low-interest state loans to help pay for upgrades. He also noted that Mr. Lumumba had been meeting with members of the Republican-dominated State Legislature, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding.

In an interview this week, Mr. Lumumba said he hoped the current crisis would finally push both state and city officials in the direction of a long-term solution.

“There’s a saying that you should allow no crisis to go to waste,” he said. “It’s crises like these that really allow us to take stock of conditions of where we are as a city, where we are as a state and hopefully it allows us to build the resolve to address it.”

The city has had a dwindling tax base for decades, after the integration of schools and other public spaces in Jackson triggered a dramatic flight of white residents. In many cases, they took their wealth and tax dollars with them. In 1960, the city was about 64 percent white and 36 percent Black. Today it is about 16 percent white and 82 percent Black.

It's been a month since some in Jackson, Miss., had usable running water. A winter storm hit the aging infrastructure in the majority Black city, and many are angry about how long the fix is taking.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Hundreds of residents in Jackson, Miss., are now in week four of a water crisis. Some in the majority-Black capital city still don't have water after last month's winter storm. Others have to boil their water first. Mississippi Public Broadcasting's Becca Schimmel spent time with a family struggling to get by.

BECCA SCHIMMEL, BYLINE: Marion Roberts has been without running water since the middle of February.

MARION ROBERTS: I'm turning the faucet on and off. And as you can see, there's no drips. There's no nothing. It's just dry. Nothing, no water.

SCHIMMEL: Roberts keeps her faucets open, so she'll hear the water as soon as it comes back on. She lives with her three adult children. The winter storm that ravaged Texas, causing millions of people there to lose power and water, also hit Mississippi, freezing pipes and breaking decades-old water mains. Roberts has been trying to pick up water from city distribution sites or buy it at grocery stores so that her family can try to have some sense of normalcy.

ROBERTS: So I've been trying to, like, keep up with it. We take baths with it. We take, like, four bottles of water, take a bath. Yeah. And we brush our teeth - is one bottle. We're still not able to wash dishes.

SCHIMMEL: All of those mundane and routine tasks people take for granted require more time and effort for the nearly 500 homes and businesses in Jackson that still have no water. Even flushing her toilet requires her to fill it up each time. So Roberts now has a new daily routine.

ROBERTS: Start going through the process of getting everything together. These bottles are empty. As you can see, there's an empty bottle right there. We start loading stuff up in the trunk. I had a water cooler. And we'd just fill up the water and then bring it back to the house. And I would do that probably - I was doing it twice a day. Now I'm down to doing it once a day. So, like, tomorrow, if I need some more water, I'll go back, fill up.

SCHIMMEL: Robert's 20-year-old daughter Melody hasn't had a proper shower at home for weeks. Every day when she goes to college, she worries about what other people think.

MELODY: It don't make me feel so confident as much as I am because I'm like, I cleaned myself, but what if I have a smell to me because I don't have water at home?

SCHIMMEL: And her mother, Marion, cares deeply for her city. Seeing the people of Jackson go without water for so long is maddening, especially when it feels like people outside the state have forgotten about Mississippians who are suffering.

ROBERTS: I mean, I feel like the help has lessened. You don't see the National Guard out here anymore. Everybody's gone. It's like, forget them. And I feel like it's because of the color of my skin. And I hate that.

SCHIMMEL: South Jackson, where the Roberts live, has been hit especially hard by the water crisis. Jackson's population is about 80% Black and has long had trouble getting the attention and financial help it needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba doesn't deny how racism has factored into the city's underfunded infrastructure.

CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: I think that if we're honest with ourselves, we have to recognize the role that that plays. Often, we're a bit skittish of having those conversations. But we have to realize that issues of race are as American as apple pie.

SCHIMMEL: Lumumba says the city has known it's needed to rebuild its infrastructure for years. In 2010, another big freeze did even more damage than this winter storm. The mayor says Jackson needs help, and it's going to take state or federal funding to secure safe drinking water. For Marion Roberts, she's debating what's next for her.

ROBERTS: I mean, I love the city of Jackson. I love Mississippi. I was raised here. But if I had a choice, to be honest, if I can get up and move - like, somebody told me, you can go anywhere - I would move.

SCHIMMEL: It's still unclear when the water will be back on for the hundreds of people like her. For NPR News, I'm Becca Schimel in Jackson, Miss.

The city of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice after two winter storms disrupted daily life last week.

More than 10,000 across Mississippi are still without power and water, according to the latest estimate from PowerOutage.US. There is still no definitive timetable for when these utilities will return.

Here is what you need to know and what you need to do — as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — if you and your household remain under a boil-water notice:

FOR SUBSCRIBERS: Mississippi still reeling from winter storms as leaders struggle to deal with fallout

JACKSON WATER CRISIS: Residents, businesses still with little to no water

What do I do if I'm under a boil-water notice?

The CDC and the Mississippi State Department of Health suggest bringing water to a full boil for 1 minute and allowing it to cool before using it. The health department recommends the following steps:

Don't drink tap water

Don't use iced made from recent tap water

Don't use tap water to make drinks, juices or fountain soft drinks.

Only cook with tap water if food is boiled for at least one minute.

Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water

You should boil tap water even if it is filtered, including water from a refrigerator or ice maker.

Can you shower/bathe with a boil water order?

It is safe to shower, but be careful not to swallow any water. Young children should be supervised to ensure they don't drink water.

Can you wash dishes during a boil-water notice?

Dishwashers are typically safe to use if the final rinse temperature reaches at least 150 degrees or if the machine has sanitizing cycle. Otherwise, it is best to used disposable dishes and utensils.

While the CDC says dishwashers are generally safe to use, the Mississippi State Department of Health does not recommend it.

If you need to wash dishes by hand, wash and rinse as you normally would using hot water, but in a separate basin add 1 teaspoon of unscented household liquid bleach for each gallon of warm water. Soak the rinsed dishes in the water for at least one minute, and let dishes air dry before using.

Can you do laundry?

Yes, laundry can be done as usual during a boil-water advisory.

What about pets?

Pets could also get sick from drinking water during a boil-water advisory. Provide your animals with bottled water or boiled water.

What do I do when the boil-water notice is lifted?

According to the state health department, here are the steps to take:

Flush faucets for a total of 10 minutes to introduce system water throughout the house plumbing Flush faucet a minimum of 2 minutes to ensure clearing of the line serving the faucet

Discard any drinks, ice, food, etc, made during the boil water notice.

Rewash any food or drink contact items (knives, forks, plates, etc.) with cleared system water.

Check water filters and replace if necessary.

Do not use water from your hot water heater for drinking until several exchanges of the tank have occurred.

Run dishwasher through a cycle or two before washing dishes.

How do I get more information?

If you have any further questions, you can contact the Mississippi State Department of Health Bureau of Public Water Supply by calling (601) 576-7518.

7,"Mar 10, 2021",In These Times,Biden Could Help Prevent Water Crises Like the One in Jackson—If He Stands Up to Corporations,"A month after winter storms wreaked havoc across the U.S. South, Jackson, Mississippi is still in the midst of a major crisis. As of March 5, thousands of residents continued to lack water service, and many more were subject to boil water advisories — all in the midst of a raging global pandemic that has caused immense suffering, especially in BIPOC communities.

The immediate cause of the crisis was record low temperatures, which caused many of the city’s aging pipes to break and knocked the main water treatment plant offline. But the situation in Jackson has much deeper roots, and it highlights the intersections between deteriorating infrastructure, racism and white supremacy, racial disparities in public health, and the failures of privatization. As the Biden administration begins to ramp up its infrastructure plans, it should not only prioritize cities like Jackson, but also ensure that badly needed infrastructure investments strengthen and preserve local ownership and control rather than siphon them off to giant corporations and international banks through exploitative and extractive privatization and public-private partnership (PPP) deals.

Like many cities, much of Jackson’s water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement. While the recent storms exacerbated the system’s problems, residents in the 82% Black, largely low-income city have long dealt with boil water advisories and contaminated water. In fact, as Gizmodo’s Dharna Noor points out, ​“research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color.”

The plight of Jackson’s water system is a direct result of entrenched white supremacy in the state. ​“Be very clear,” Donna Ladd, founding editor of the Jackson Free Press, recently wrote, ​“white wealth didn’t just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn’t take with them — a 20th century Sherman’s march out of American cities.” This process has included underfunding the city’s schools, using state legislation to control what the city can do to generate tax revenue, and, egregiously, attempting to seize control of the city’s publicly owned airport, which, Ladd writes, is ​“one of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left.”

Much of the attention being paid to Jackson’s water crisis has highlighted the need for significant federal and state support for water infrastructure modernization. Yet another critical part of the story hasn’t received the same consideration: The crisis in Jackson demonstrates not only the need for large-scale infrastructure investments, but the dangers of funneling those funds into extractive privatization and PPP deals that are often overly expensive, under-performing, and lack local accountability and control.

In 2012, former Jackson Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. — the city’s first Black mayor — realized that previous white-led administrations had left the city’s water infrastructure in poor shape. As part of his efforts to fix the problem that year, Mayor Johnson signed a $90 million deal with Siemens — a large German multinational corporation — to upgrade water and sewer facilities, install new water meters and implement an automated billing system. Five years later, however, the Jackson City Council authorized new mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to sue Siemens and its subcontractors for numerous failures related to the contract.

The lawsuit alleged that ​“instead of generating revenue or savings for the City, the work Siemens contracted to complete resulted in problems that have thrown Jackson’s water-sewer system into crisis and the City further into debt.” In particular, the new meter and billing system was riddled with problems, leading some residents to never receive a utility bill and others to receive exorbitant bills that they couldn’t pay. This, in turn, led the city to start moving money from its general fund to pay for water and sewer repairs.

More egregiously, Mayor Lumumba alleged that Siemens and the subcontractors ​“manipulated the minority contracting rules” to essentially double the cost of the project. While Siemens disputed these accusations, the company nonetheless settled the city’s lawsuit in early 2020 — agreeing to repay the entire $90 million contract. While this was a victory for the city’s residents, the amount (of which lawyers will take a substantial cut) is far less than the original $450 million the city was seeking when lost revenue and additional costs to repair the damaged system are taken into account.

Jackson is not alone in suffering the ill-effects of corporate involvement in the provision of water. There has been growing resistance to water privatization in the United States in recent years, along with several high-profile remunicipalizations—where privately-run services have been brought back under public control. Three interconnected factors, which were seen to varying degrees in Jackson, are driving many of these local efforts: higher rates and costs under private operation; poor performance and service by private operators; and loss of local control over decision making.

While large-scale investments — like the $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden laid out on the campaign trail — are urgently needed to address the critical issues facing Jackson and other U.S. communities, the design of such programs will be critical. Those investments could either serve to lower racial and economic inequality, provide high-quality services, and preserve local control by supporting public and cooperative ownership structures; or they could supercharge privatization and line the pockets of large multinational corporations at the expense of the health and prosperity of local residents.

If the Biden administration is serious about ​“Building Back Better,” it must ensure that justice and equity are at the heart of its agenda.","Like many cities, much of Jackson’s water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement.
While the recent storms exacerbated the system’s problems, residents in the 82% Black, largely low-income city have long dealt with boil water advisories and contaminated water.

8,"Mar 6, 2021",NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi has a water crisis because our state legislature has a race problem","Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves told the media this week, “I do think it's really important that the City of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money.""

As the governor gave that lecture on March 3 in his state’s capital city, thousands of homes near where he sat in Jackson were without even non-potable water to flush their toilets, and not a single home in the city limits had access to safe drinking water we could use without boiling first.

The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann threw out a telling statement of his own when he criticized the poverty-stricken city for not fixing its own water system, adding, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?”

Mayor Ditto's final term in office ended in 1997; people born during it are old enough to buy alcohol these days.

The real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

For people not steeped in Mississippi politics, Ditto — not coincidentally — was Jackson’s last white mayor before white-flight demographic shifts brought Harvey Johnson Jr., an urban planner and infrastructure wonk who devoted $200 million to the problem, to office. Johnson warned repeatedly of a future breakdown of our aging systems in Jackson, including around the state Capitol where Reeves and Hosemann had the temerity to lecture us. This was a system, it’s worth noting, that was not exactly handed over to Black leadership in pristine shape, with nary a crack or challenge. It was already in trouble then.

But white state leadership at the time and ever since — including those whose families left Jackson after the forced desegregation of schools in early 1970 — have typically responded to the city’s Black leaders with contempt, blank stares or condescension.

The immediate cause of the broad, systemic breakdown of Jackson’s water system was the same unprecedented cold-weather spell for which Texas received national attention in February. But the real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

Still, as my reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, Nick Judin, and I understood — because he and I grew up in the area — Reeves and Hosemann's words augured back to a long-held talking point and belief among many white Mississippians: Black leaders just aren’t competent. And the people who elect them deserve what they get.

In the last couple days, we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and help its capital city through this water crisis.

It’s not like this belittlement tactic is accidental. It dates back to a time when Jackson was a wealthy white center of power for the state — until the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 started upending the white-supremacist status quo. Jackson political and business leaders panicked at the thought of integrated schools — and children of different races getting to know and respect each other (gasp) — as well as the prospect of Black people voting, holding top offices and ordering their sandwiches at the city's lunch counters instead of the cafes' backdoors.

So, via the racist Citizens’ Councils that soon spread across the U.S. as far west as San Francisco, the elites in Jackson started marketing three old and intertwined ideas, as Jackson historian Stephanie Rolph details in her book “Resisting Equality: The Citizens’ Council, 1954-1989.” First, they pushed that Black people were born inferior; second, that their supposed inferiority meant they couldn’t run things well; and third, that they are constitutionally prone to crime.

All this rhetoric has helped drive businesses and residents out of Jackson from the 1950s to this day, despite zero evidence for any of the vicious lies.

Still, the racist Citizens Councils' putrid ideas stuck around, influencing many in and outside Mississippi. The myths were and are assisted by every possible effort to ensure that Black people — who have been redlined and discriminated out of the same wealth-generation avenues that white people had enjoyed since slavery was legal — could not prove them wrong. Much of that has come in the form of withholding the financial resources necessary for the basic running and maintenance of, say, a capital city, its public schools and its water and sewer systems.

Be very clear: white wealth didn’t just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn't take with them — a 20th century Sherman's march out of American cities, if you will.

Whether those in power have bothered to face our history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

Many of the same prominent whites who proudly attended well-funded public schools in Jackson before integration have, since abandoning the city, done everything possible to limit even “adequate” urban school funding or to redirect the money to legacy segregation academies — now usually called “private Christian academies.” They use the state legislature to control how much Jackson can tax our own citizens in order to pay for our own needs. They won’t support desperately needed flood mitigation for the city — unless it provides rich white people with valuable waterfront development. And Medicaid expansion in the time of Covid-19? Forget about it.

White state politicians are even trying to steal one of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left. In 2016, white Mississippi Republicans began a naked attempt to take over the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport — a name, by the way, that still displeases some of the Old Guard — by passing legislation to replace its city-appointed commissioners with a state-appointed governing board, only two of whom would come from Jackson. Black legislators called the move “Jim Crow legislation.” Primary sponsors of the bill didn’t try to hide that they have real-estate interests in the whiter suburban areas just outside the airport gates.

Oh, and their continual excuse for taking it? The airport leaders aren’t up to the task of managing it. (I’ll allow you to imagine the race of those highly qualified professionals.)

On Thursday night, I co-moderated a Jackson mayoral debate in which Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba recounted that Lt. Gov. Hosemann had offered him financial help for the city — an insulting $30 million — if he would drop a lawsuit that has forestalled the theft of the airport to date. Lumumba said no, of course.

The dignity for which Jacksonians are asking includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

In the last couple days — since Hosemann’s Ditto comment — we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state of Mississippi is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and actually help its capital city through this water crisis: They are now in discussions about financial assistance of at least $47 million.

Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers. Whether those who engage in that thinking have bothered to face that history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

I get it, though: A racist political machine raised many white Mississippians to believe they were simply superior at running things, over any given Black leader in the state. They look at the world through white-tinged glasses and believe their power and wealth, or any power or wealth they might eventually be able to amass, is dependent on scrapping over scarcity. They think they don’t or won't get theirs if they treat the majority-Black capital city, its leaders and its residents with the respect and dignity our citizens deserve.

That dignity for which Jacksonians are asking, though, includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

It’s long, long past time to put Citizens Council-era propaganda to rest and treat Black leaders and Black Mississipians like equals, not like pawns in yet another white power game.","The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov.

9,"Feb 19, 2021",ABC News,"No 'definitive timeline' when water will return to Jackson, Mississippi: Mayor","""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Jackson's public works director said.

As power and water outages rock the South, among the hard-hit cities is Jackson, Mississippi, where most residents face little to no water pressure.

""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover.""

""This becomes increasingly challenging"" due to the pandemic, Lumumba said, because so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the length of the cold snap in Jackson has taken a toll on the water production.

""Hopefully by this weekend you will start seeing some pressure build back up and water will slowly be restored,"" Williams said Thursday, adding that it's difficult to give a timeline because the weather impacts are ""unpredictable.""

""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Williams said. ""We're working around the clock.""

On Friday, Williams told reporters there was some progress in the city's water pressure, but it was still hard to predict when people will get their water back. Those who live closer to the city's two water plants should expect to have water sooner than those who live farther away, he said.

Water main breaks are another concern; as of Friday afternoon, there were 13 in the city, with more expected as the ice and snow melts, Williams said.

""We hope that it does not increase very much because that will delay some of the recovery process,"" he said.

A boil water notice was issued Thursday.

Jackson officials are offering water distribution at several sites Friday.

Besides the water emergency, between 18,000 to 19,000 customers in Jackson were without power Thursday, largely due to limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain, the mayor said.

Lumumba warned that roads are still topped with ice and urged caution while driving to get basic necessities.

""This is the time ... to help one another, especially our most vulnerable constituents,"" City Council President Aaron Banks said.

After a week of historic and disastrous snow, ice and cold in the South, the freezing temperatures will soon lift. A hard freeze warning is in effect in Mississippi Friday morning but temperatures are expected to rise this weekend.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was expected to meet Monday with Environmental Protection Agency officials to request federal funding as the capital city's unprecedented water crisis nears its fourth week.

City officials continue to say water pressure is being restored, but shared no data to show any progress. In some pockets of the city, largely among those on higher elevations, residents are still experiencing little to no water pressure.

The drinking water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a citywide boil notice first issued on Feb. 16.

Testing has revealed the city's water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance the water may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams on Monday said the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city possibly Thursday once the city's water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

Williams said about 95% of the city's approximately 43,000 water customers now have water. He did not provide a specific number of residents still dealing with an outage, adding a majority of those still without water live off Forest Hill and McCluer roads in south Jackson.

Meanwhile, Lumumba and city officials continue to scramble to solicit state and federal funding as the notice extends into a third week.

Lumumba said Friday the EPA has been responsive for possible federal relief for the city's troubled water system.

The City Council last week approved a request from the mayor's office to apply for a grant from the EPA that could bring in $500,000, according to the EPA.

Also last week, Lumumba sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves requesting about $47 million in state and federal funds.

11,"Mar 8, 2021",Mississippi Today,Lt. Gov. Hosemann on Jackson water crisis: “We want to help.”,"Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who wields significant control over the state of Mississippi’s budget, said he is open to appropriating funds to the city of Jackson, where thousands of residents are in their fourth week without running water.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, while city officials said water pressure has been restored to “95% of the city,” about 5,000 Jackson residents are still without water. City leaders say they need major investment from the state to replace their entire water and sewage system, which is estimated to cost about $2 billion.

Hosemann, in a one-on-one interview on Monday with Mississippi Today, said that he considers all options on the table in terms of financially supporting Jackson, including through several bills pending in the Legislature and potentially sending some of the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Congress is expected to pass later this week.

“I’ve lived in Jackson more than 50 years. More than half my life has been spent here,” Hosemann told Mississippi Today. “I’ve spent a lot of time trying to make it better, and I want to make it better now. There’s a water crisis, and we want to help. Where we can help them with the funding, I want to do that. Jackson is the capital of Mississippi. It deserves to be supported as such.”

Hosemann continued: “The people that are responsible are the leaders of the city, and they need to come up with a cogent plan that explains how much they need and what they’re going to do with funding they may get. That gives us more room to support them monetarily.”

Hosemann and Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba are scheduled to meet Tuesday morning to discuss the crisis and how the state can help. Lumumba, who wrote a letter to state leaders last week asking for an initial emergency appropriation of $47 million, met with Speaker of the House Philip Gunn on Friday.

READ MORE: Talks begin at Capitol to secure state funding for Jackson water crisis

In addition to considering potential state funding, Hosemann and his staff studied the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Congress is expected to pass this week. The lieutenant governor on Monday said he believed there are several pots of money within that package that could be appropriated to Jackson for work on its water system.

Questions about whether lawmakers will support the city have swirled after tension between Hosemann and Lumumba — long whispered about in the halls of the Capitol — came to light on March 4 during a mayoral debate ahead of 2021 municipal elections. At the heart of the tiff between the lieutenant governor and mayor is control of the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport, which state leaders have tried for years to wrest from the city.

In 2016, lawmakers approved a bill to take over the airport and replace the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority with a regional board made up of state, county, and city appointees.

That law, however, has not gone into effect after the city joined a federal lawsuit to block the takeover. That lawsuit has continued, and city officials have said the state’s motives were race-based. Currently, the city controls the airport with its own board. All board members are African American. The lawmakers who pushed and passed the 2016 legislation are white.

“I sat down with the lieutenant governor to talk about Jackson’s infrastructure problem,” Lumumba said during the debate, referencing a meeting that occurred before the current water crisis. “We had a conversation that lasted for about an hour and a half, and he asked everyone to leave the room only to say, ‘Mayor, I need you to give me my airport, and I look at it for about $30 million.’”

Lumumba continued: “Not only am I supposed to be dumb, I’m also supposed to be cheap.”

When asked on Monday about the mayor’s comments, Hosemann said the inference that infrastructure funding from the state would be held up over any airport-related business “is completely inaccurate.”

“My concern about the work we have to do on Jackson’s water is a totally separate matter,” Hosemann said. “In regards to pending litigation between the city and state over the airport, I did speak about that with the mayor and said I would like to settle that case. But there is not a quid pro quo here. (The current water crisis) occurred after our meeting. We were in discussions about a number of things about the city, and I told him it was confidential. I intend to honor my side of the bargain.”

When asked if the airport would be a consideration during debate about whether to provide Jackson with state funding for its current crisis, Hosemann said, “Absolutely not. I just disagree with that.”

Meanwhile, a House bill introduced by Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, on Monday seeks legislative approval to allow the city of Jackson to hold a summer referendum to pass a one-cent sales tax increase. If approved, that new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — could be used to back large bonds that the city would use to revamp its water and sewer system.

The House bill was dropped after a Friday meeting between Lumumba and Speaker Gunn in which the mayor asked for support of the city’s one-cent sales tax increase. Lumumba also asked Gunn to consider the $47 million emergency appropriation for specific projects.

While Gunn made no promises, several of the meeting’s attendees expressed optimism that future talks between the speaker and mayor would continue as the 2021 legislative session approaches its scheduled end of April 4.

Hosemann said he’ll hear the mayor out in their Tuesday meeting and will work with senators to determine the best course of action. He added: “Everything is on the table.”

“I think asking questions (of the city) about a specific plan is healthy and important,” Hosemann said. “But we’re not going to ignore the crisis or the people affected. That’s not who I am personally, whether I’ve been an elected official or not. The city has its leadership, the state has its leadership, and we want to make sure we’re helpful to any citizen in a crisis.”

12,"Mar 8, 2021",Truthout,Jackson Residents Are Going on Week Four Without Water in Mississippi,"After a winter storm caused record low temperatures and snowfall across the U.S. in February, thousands of residents in Jackson, Mississippi, lost water in their homes. As the city slowly fixes water breaks, some residents are now in their fourth week without water.

Tens of thousands of Jackson’s 160,000 residents went weeks without water after the storm, and the rest of the city was, and still is, under a boil-water advisory. Last week, the city’s public works director Charles Williams said that a quarter of the city, or about 10,000 connections, still lacked water. As of Friday, the city had restored connections to 42,000 customers total and fewer than 5,000 customers still lacked water.

The storm had frozen machinery at the city’s water treatment plant and had caused 101 water main breaks and leaks, at least 70 of which the city had repaired last week, the city said. The National Guard has been assisting in water distribution to the residents of the city, but they’re still waiting for hours in lines to get water bottles or non-potable water for flushing toilets.

There are many residents, however, who can’t access the water that the city is distributing. With over a quarter of the city’s residents in poverty, many people don’t have the time or resources to wait in lines for hours for water.

Many organizers, residents and observers say that part of the reason for the crisis is that the city has a majority Black population, and the city has thus had less funding and support. Over 82 percent of the city is Black, and the city has been losing residents, mostly white ones, for decades. The declining tax revenue as a result of the population loss is just one contributor to the city’s infrastructure problem.

The Mississippi city’s infrastructure has been in poor shape for decades, and the city’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, has called Jackson an “aging city with an aging budget.” The city has a budget of about $300 million a year and “a more than $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,” Lumumba said during a press conference last month.

Donna Ladd, editor of The Jackson Free Press and the Mississippi Free Press, said in an article for MSNBC that the state and city’s white supremacist leadership in the past decades has set up Jackson for failure.

“The fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level,” wrote Ladd. “It is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.” White state-level politicians, Ladd says, have continually made moves to stunt Jackson’s growth, financially and otherwise.

The crisis is also connected to climate catastrophe. The February storm was almost certainly a result of the climate crisis causing unusual weather patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather, which Lumumba has acknowledged. The city’s infrastructure, much like the energy infrastructure in Texas, was not ready for the cold temperatures that suddenly hit the state.

“Not only do we need this investment because of the aging infrastructure,” Lumumba said earlier this month, “we need this investment because of the increased pressure that these extreme weather conditions are taking.” Lumumba has requested $47 million in emergency funding from Republican Gov. Tate Reeves for needed water infrastructure updates.

This isn’t the first time that Jackson has experienced issues with their water; the city’s residents have continually experienced service issues over the years, and have grappled with lead pollution crises in the past. The recent water shortages, one local resident told Gizmodo, are just a continuation of environmental racism that Jackson and many other nonwhite communities will continue to face as the climate crisis worsens.

JACKSON, Miss. – A water outage in Jackson, Mississippi, has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil notice has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

Officials in the city of roughly 160,000 people said the water pressure was being restored after it was depleted by a winter storm that passed through the area three weeks ago. In some pockets of the city, largely among higher elevations, residents were still experiencing little to no water pressure as of Monday.

The water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a boil notice issued Feb. 16.

Testing revealed the water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance it may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city Thursday once water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

A helping hand: As Jackson's water crisis continues, outside communities bring water to residents in need

How did this happen? Here's what to know about the water crisis in Jackson:

Feb. 16 : Weather chokes city facilities

Winter weather and icy temperatures choked equipment at water treatment plants, rendering water pressure inadequate.

Nearly 43,000 water customers were placed under a boil-water advisory.

Feb. 18 : No set timeline for restoration

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced the capital city did not have a definitive timeline for total water restoration.

Williams noted water main breaks popping up that further complicated the process of getting water to residents.

Water distribution sites began to lace the city, and fire stations made available nonpotable water for residents.

Feb. 22 : 300,000 in Mississippi under boil water advisories

The state Health Department recorded 300,000 customers under boil water advisories across Mississippi.

Convenience and grocery stores saw a surge in demand for bottled water as many residents did not have safe water. Supplies began to run low.

City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said Jackson provided more than 26,500 bottles of water and about 7,000 gallons of nonpotable water.

Feb. 23 : Governor activates Guard

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd secured tankers to provide nonpotable water. He activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.

Feb. 24 : Officials warn of water main breaks

Officials said most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week, but they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays.

Ten water distribution sites popped up.

Feb. 25 : Water pressure gradually increasing

Williams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed them to pump out more water.

Mayor Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.

March 1 : Pressure falls back; south Jackson struggles

Williams said the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. South Jackson residents struggled with a lack of water and water pressure.

Up to 80 water main breaks were reported since the storm hit. Workers mended the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials manned water distribution sites.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.

March 2 : No city data on water outages

Officials said they did not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration.

Williamssaid south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.

March 3 : Aging infrastructure at fault, official says

Water intake filters full of clams, mussels, fish and other items forced systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.

Williams confirmed more than 10,000 water customers did not have any water. Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, he said.

Previously: Weeks after Mississippi winter storms, some residents still don't have water

March 4 : An email to the governor

Media outlets get hold of an email Lumumba sent to Reeves on March 3. Lumumba requested about $47 million in emergency funding from the state and federal government to cover a wide range of projects relating to water system infrastructure.

Seeking answers from the city: Mississippi's capital city hasn't had clean water in weeks. Is there an end in sight?

State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said the Department of Health continued to monitor the quality of Jackson's water supply and was working with the city.

March 8: Low pressure, boil water advisory remained

Several residents, businesses and schools continue to deal with low water pressure.

Jackson remains under a water boil advisory because of high turbidity – cloudiness that increases the possibility water might contain disease-causing organisms.

City officials said Thursday Jackson's water system still faces numerous challenges from prolonged freezing temperatures and could not say for certain when water will be restored.

Live weather updates: Power outages skyrocket in Mississippi, many roads closed

Since Wednesday, residents across the city have been left with little to no water pressure due to issues with the city's water distribution system. The entire city remains under a boil water notice.

In light of the crisis, the city plans to distribute bottled water and non-potable water to residents at fire stations and city facilities as early as Thursday afternoon, although a specific time was unavailable.

""I owe you honesty. I owe you truth,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday at the city's Real Time Command Center. ""We do not have a definitive timeline on water restoration.""

Water shortage in Jackson: Winter weather causing water pressure issue in Jackson. Here's the latest on Wednesday

Public Works Director Charles Williams said it is possible water will be restored by this weekend, but cautioned it is not a certainty given the cold snap.

""The weather system has created havoc on the water distribution system and also on our plants,"" Williams said. ""We knew cold temperatures were coming in but didn't factor the length of time it would be here.

""We're working through different scenarios and hopefully by this weekend it'll be restored. Unfortunately, It's difficult to give a time line.""

Transportation issues have delayed the delivery of chemicals to treat the water and the supply is getting low, officials added. Another factor tied to the shortage is that residents are staying at home during the cold snap and using more water than usual.

The mayor's office in a Wednesday night press release said it has been overwhelmed with calls from residents.

The office is asking for patience and to reserve calls to the following numbers for visible water leaks or urgent needs for assistance: 601-960-1777, 601-960-1781, 601-960-1778, 601-960-0379 or 601-960-1779.

Water distribution sites

Constituent Services Manager Keisha Sanders, who is heading up the bottled water distribution effort, said the city is finalizing delivery of the water with a vendor. Transportation to Jackson has been the biggest hitch holding the delivery up, she said.

When it is available, water will be distributed from the following locations:

Smith-Wills Stadium on Lakeland Drive

Metrocenter Mall

JPD Precinct One, 810 Cooper Rd.

Virgie P. Middleton Community Center, Flag Chapel Road

Jackson Police Officers Training Academy, 3000 St. Charles Road

Willowwood Community Center, 229 Lake Cove Dr.

City of Byram Fire Station

Non-potable water, which is unsafe to drink, will be distributed at fire stations across the city except for Station 20 on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Station 10 on Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Station 22 on Lakeshore Drive.

Jackson power outages

Between 17,000 to 18,000 residents lost power Wednesday night after a second winter storm system moved in and dropped freezing rain on tree limbs and power lines.

Entergy crews are currently cutting trees and working to restore the outages which occurred in pockets across the city, Lumumba said.

The mayor clarified there have been no rolling blackouts in Jackson as there have been in other cities, despite some claims on social media.

16,"May 3, 2021",Water Quality Products,"Jackson, Mississippi, Experiences Drinking Water Crisis","Jackson, Mississippi, experienced water issues since winter storms in mid-February, which will be addressed in a May 11 meeting concerning the water system.

Jackson, Mississippi, has been experiencing water issues since winter storms in mid-February.

The city was under a boil notice as a result. Residents experienced low pressure in faucets and in the wake of the boil notice water distribution centers cropped up in the city.

Jackson went without clean water for nearly a month, according to Good Morning America.

According to Public Works Director Charles William, water main breaks that occurred complicated the process of getting water to residents, reported Good Morning America.

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system and tweeted that he secured tankers to provide non potable water to residents. The Mississippi National Guard was activated as well to assist Jackson during the crisis.

According to a water sample taken Feb. 23, 2021, the water showed turbidity levels greater than 1.0 turbidity units, which is above the standard of 0.30 turbidity units, according to the city’s website.

According to Williams, the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. This was short-lived and the city once more began to experience low water pressure, with more than 10,000 water customers not having any water, reported USA Today.

Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, added Williams.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer Jackson residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes, reported USA Today.

Additionally, The Department of Health and the EPA inspected the city’s two water treatment plants, O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell, on Feb. 3, 2020 and found numerous violations of federal regulations governing clean drinking water.

Federal officials will address the Jackson City Council at a May 11 meeting concerning Jackson’s water system, reported The Northside Sun.

17,"Mar 1, 2021",ABC News,Water crisis in South persists following devastating winter storm,"Half a million Texans and most of Jackson, Mississippi, are without water.

Hundreds of thousands of residents in the South are still dealing with the after effects of two devastating winter storms as cities struggle to provide drinking water.

Residents in Jackson, Mississippi, are still under a boil water alert, and some residents still do not have running water after the back-to-back winter storms last month wreaked havoc on the city's water system.

While significant progress was made Sunday on restoring pressure to the system, and water for flushing toilets was restored on Monday, the city's water system does not have a time table on when a full restoration will be complete, ABC Jackson affiliate WAPT reported. Water was previously expected to be fully restored by the end of last week, Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday.

Jackson resident Taylor Corso told ABC News that residents were so desperate to flush their toilets they collected snow and melted it in their tubs to add to the reservoir tank.,

On Wednesday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves dispatched the National Guard and more tanker trucks to Jackson to aid in the water crisis.

Corso said many people in the city do not have the means to ""just go and get bottled water"" or even go to distribution centers to fill up their own containers.

""Our most vulnerable citizens really aren't -- that's not something that's super accessible to them.""

Jackson resident Terri Hall told WAPT that water has only been dripping from her faucet and that what little comes out is mixed with sediment. She has been without water for 10 days.

""We can't bathe in this, because if there is microbes in the water, they can enter your mouth, eyes, and nose, and can't wash dishes because you don't want to ingest that way,"" she said.

Corso said in the past, problems have been solved within one to four days.

""So the time is extensive here, and it's so widespread -- I mean, tens of thousands of residents here are without any water,"" she said.

In Texas, more than half a million people are still under boil water advisories, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. At one point, more than 14.4 million people, about half of the state's population, were affected by weather-related water disruptions.

Although the boil water advisory was lifted in Houston on Feb. 21, thousands of homes are still without water after pipes burst in freezing temperatures, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced on Sunday.

""They still do not have water, so there is a tremendous need,"" Turner said.

About 10,000 people showed up to a distribution center Sunday to pick up cases of water and meal kits, Turner said.

Turner has requested more supplies from FEMA so licensed plumbers can continue to repair the pipes, according to the release.

Business agent Rick Lord told ABC Houston station KTRK that when he recently went to a local hardware store, the plumbing section was empty, describing it as ""Black Friday on steroids in the plumbing aisle.""

De’Keither Stamps in her tub. With no water pressure, the water will be used to flush the toilet. Photo : Rogelio V. Solis ( AP )

Right now, Calandra Davis’ water pressure is too low to take a shower. When she turns on her sinks, the water comes out at a slow trickle. For weeks, she’s had to bathe herself and her 6-year-old son with water from store-bought bottles. Like all residents of Jackson, Mississippi, she’s also been on a boil-water notice for a week due to high turbidity. But in many ways, she feels lucky.

“I feel like I’m privileged in that I have water at all right now and in that I didn’t go super long without water,” she said. Unlike more than 50,000 people in her city, she also didn’t lose power.

Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute and organizer with the social justice organization Black Youth Project 100, has been spending hours each day on mutual aid efforts, delivering food and water, and helping get those without utilities into hotel rooms. While working a local emergency relief hotline, she’s heard from people who are struggling because they have medical conditions that require electronic devices or water access, and from dozens whose groceries all spoiled when their power went out. She says in Jackson, the lowest-income Black communities in the south and west are facing the worst effects.

“It’s environmental racism,” she said.

Infrastructural issues in Jackson aren’t new, and they’re also not unique to the city. They’re endemic in the state, and they disproportionately affect poor, Black populations. Though the spotlight might still be on Texas, it’s clear that the infrastructure we rely on for modern life is in dire need of updates across the South. If we don’t make them, low-income people of color will continue to suffer the worst burdens.

During last month’s southern cold snap, Texas captured headlines. But Mississippi and other parts of the South faced similar frigid conditions that national news crews passed over. Some parts of the state saw their lowest temperatures in recorded history, and water systems throughout central Mississippi were thrown into complete disarray. Jackson’s main water plant was rendered inoperable by the cold. Davis lost water altogether for two days. While her water is marginally back, others are currently on their third week without any. While the weather has warmed up, people’s lives are still stuck in mid-February.

Like Texas, Mississippi is a state run by conservatives who believe in very limited government, which has made these immediate issues harder to overcome. Organizers like Davis have stepped in to help, but the lack of national attention has left them with a smaller stream of donations than those pouring into Texas organizations.

“Texas needs and deserves all of the resources and assistance that they’re getting, if not more, but I would love for people not to turn a blind eye to what’s also happening in Mississippi as well,” said Davis.

Over the past week, people have started to open their eyes as Jackson’s water crisis. But stories of other parts of Mississippi, especially its poor, rural areas home to many of the state’s people of color, are still largely absent. Nearby communities are also on boil-water notice, including Holmes County’s 98% Black Tchula and 76.2% Black Cruger, and Claireborne County’s 91.5% Black Port Gibson. Dozens of households in both counties are also still experiencing power outages, as are hundreds within Jackson.

“I want clean water and a stable system in the city of Jackson, but not only just in the city of Jackson, I want that for the rural communities that are suffering,” Danyelle Holmes, a field team lead for the Poor People’s Campaign who lives in Jackson, said. “As we speak, right now, they’re also in the same predicament.”

Last month’s cold weather was an acute shock to Mississippi’s water systems and power grid, but the ongoing damage is the product of decades of neglect and disinvestment. Without funding and support, both systems are bound to fail the people they’re supposed to serve again, especially as extreme weather becomes more common amid the climate crisis and puts increased pressure on infrastructure.

Long before the recent storm, Jackson was also often plagued by water main breaks and had reported lead concentrations in drinking water well above federal action levels, all the result of aging infrastructure. Many pipes in the city are more than a century old, and official estimates that the necessary upgrades and repairs will cost $2 billion. Jackson’s water is also frequently contaminated by agricultural runoff in the Mississippi River. On top of that, the city’s out-of-date water billing system has been a source of inaccurate bills and endless frustration, costing residents time and money for a system that’s wholly inadequate.

“Sure, right now we’re on a boil-water notice, but that happens quite frequently,” said Holmes. “And we often lose pressure at our water treatment plants, so it’s not unusual for us to experience that or be on a boil water alert. It’s not even unusual for water to be brown...or to have a smell like chlorine or even smell like sewer. On a good day we have clear water, but on a normal day the water is brown.”

The city is 82% Black with a median household income under $40,000. Research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color. While Mississippi is majority-white and a stronghold of the Republican party at the state level, Jackson’s current mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba—the son of a well-known Black revolutionary—ran on a promise to make his city “the most radical city on the planet.” Improving its infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, yet the city only has so many resources at its disposal; its operating budget is just over $350 million and only a fraction is for water and sewage. Fixing the structural problems facing Jackson’s infrastructure—to say nothing of even smaller towns in rural Mississippi—requires federal and state help. Yet state officials seem more intent on blaming city officials than working with them.

Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Tate Reeve intimated that it was city officials’ fault for these infrastructural crises on Jackson’s city leadership. But Rukia Lumumba, founder of the People’s Advocacy Institute and sister of Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, said that the state is, in fact, to blame.

“The state’s response has been significantly inadequate and neglectful,” she said. “But they blame it on the progressive, Black leadership.”



Advertisement

She noted Reeves waited until a week into the water crisis to mobilize the National Guard to help get people water for drinking, cooking, and flushing toilets. It was only Thursday that Reeves announced he requested federal aid despite the ongoing disaster.



This neglect, Lumumba said, is what she’s come to expect from Reeves. Just last year, he failed to pass a bill that would have provided funding for struggling water ratepayers and infrastructure repairs. Unlike Jackson’s city leadership, he has also consistently failed to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis, and the ways it will make those repairs and upgrades all the more urgent as it ushers in more erratic weather. That includes not just cold snaps but also heat waves that could increase water demand and increased flooding, which could strain already damaged pipes.

Advertisement

To fix all this, Rukia Lumumba said the state should make funds available immediately, not just to Jackson but also to surrounding rural communities, which are plagued with similar issues. State leaders should also increase the amount of food and water supplies they are distributing to struggling residents. Rukia Lumumba spearheaded the Mississippi Winter Storm Rapid Response Fund through which Davis and Holmes have both been distributing necessary aid, but grassroots organizers depending on donations are no replacement for state leadership and funding.



Beyond these emergency measures, she also said the state should call upon climate experts and local organizers to help determine what infrastructure repairs are needed, and should call upon federal leaders to help fund that plan. On the national level, several proposals in the works which could help secure that funding to fix infrastructure and prepare it for climate change.

Advertisement

Last week, Democratic members of Congress in both chambers reintroduced the WATER Act, which would guarantee $35 billion annually for fixing and replacing infrastructure, addressing water contamination, and providing relief to those with unaffordable water and sewage bills. The coming covid-19 economic relief package could also be an opportunity to mobilize funding to fix water systems. Doing so could also create jobs for the millions around the country who are unemployed. And President Joe Biden has promised to allocate “40% of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments” for frontline communities plagued by environmental injustice.

“To ensure that the resources are getting to the right places, you’re going to have to go to the grassroots,” Rukia Lumumba said. “You’re going to have to literally talk to the organizations and mayors and [have a] hyperlocal strategy where you’re not relying on governors to distribute resources justly, fairly, across their state.”

Advertisement

Putting conservative state leaders in charge of deciding whether or not climate relief or infrastructural funding is available to frontline communities, said Holmes, will lead to further disaster.

“It shouldn’t be a gamble of if and when the state government is going to act,” she said. “We need to fix this issue. We need to fix it now.”

19,"Feb 24, 2021",ABC News,"Tanker trucks, National Guard dispatched to Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis","The water is not expected to be completely restored until the end of the week.

The governor of Mississippi said he's dispatching the National Guard and more tanker trucks to the state's capital city to help bring an end to a water crisis that emerged following severe winter storms that crippled the community's aging infrastructure.

Many residents of Jackson, a city of more than 160,000 people, have been struggling for over a week to secure enough water to handle basic needs, officials said.

As he waited in line at a local high school to get water from a tanker truck, Alfred Anderson Jr. summed up the feelings that he said many Jackson taxpayers have: ""This is pitiful and a shame.""

""We pay all this money ... and we have got to come out here, most of these people, and wait on to try to get stuff to flush your toilets and, you know, do your hygiene stuff and whatever,"" Anderson told ABC affiliate station WAPT in Jackson.

Casandra Woody, another Jackson resident waiting in the same line for water, said the situation ""is sad.""

""I'm just fed up,"" Woody told WAPT as she watched residents fill up as many containers that could fit in their vehicles.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

""We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix,"" Reeves said in a Tuesday night Twitter post. ""I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow (Wednesday). We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!""

Reeves noted that Jackson is one of many Mississippi cities still recovering from electrical and water emergencies.

Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday that water should be fully restored by the end of this week. But Williams said that as water pressure has been gradually increased a new problem has arisen -- busted water mains across the community. He said in recent days, city work crews have responded to fix at least 20 water main breaks.

""We had to buy some equipment in order to get where we are right now,"" Williams said. ""A lot of our equipment froze up because we could not get above 32 (degrees).""

The city's water treatment plant was knocked offline when back-to-back winter storms swept through the South last week bringing snow and below-freezing temperatures causing widespread power outages.

Williams said that at one point last week, pressure in the city's water system fell to 32 pounds per square inch. On Tuesday, he said the water pressure in the system was up to 67 PSI and that he hopes workers can get the pressure up to 80 to 85 PSI by the end of Wednesday.

Residents have been asked to boil their water before drinking and the city is establishing more locations where residents can go to get clean water.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has been the target of criticism from his constituents and city council members for his handling of the water crisis and for not getting the state moving fast enough to help fix the situation.

But Lumumba said the crisis was an ""act of God"" that exposed the city's crumbling infrastructure that he said has been neglected for decades.

Reeves agreed, saying at a news conference on Tuesday that the challenges to Jackson's water system ""were born over literally 30, 40, 50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.""

""That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we're going to fix in the next six to eight hours,"" Reeves said.","Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

Jackson State coach Deion Sanders is all in on the city of Jackson.

The first-year coach told local reporters Saturday that the Tigers' 33-27 win over Grambling State was for the capital city of the Magnolia State.

Many citizens have gone almost three weeks without clean water since winter storms swept the area.

STATEMANT MADE: Deion Sanders proves something to all of us in statement win at Grambling

""The city of Jackson, Mississippi and I want you to get this,"" Sanders said. ""This city of Jackson, Mississippi is so resilient. Do you know what we've been up against? The city. With the water problems and electrical problems and some of the elderly not receiving water, not being able to bathe. We got our butts out there and went to a nursing home this week to make sure they had water. They're so resilient, and no one's complaining. To have the city ride like that, and we just give them a little more hope, we got you. We got you. We're going to ride with you as well.""

Sanders brought up Jackson twice again unprompted before the end of the press conference. He compared his team's effort to close out a game to the city's residents. Saturday's matchup came down to the final two minutes as Grambling State was on JSU's goal line before the reigning SWAC Defensive Player of the Year came up with a fumble recovery to seal the victory.

""I learned that these guys are resilient, just like the city of Jackson. They're resilient,"" Sanders said. ""They really are, and they won't give up. They got fight in them.""

JSU (2-0, 1-0 SWAC) wasted little time getting back to campus after Saturday's win, as players weren't available to speak with the local media postgame to get back sooner. After celebrating the win this weekend, the attention shifts to the Tigers' next opponent, which is in-state rival Mississippi Valley State.

21,"Feb 23, 2021",WLBT,Gov. Reeves activates Miss. National Guard to assist with Jackson water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Update: Governor Tate Reeves has announced that he has activated the Mississippi National Guard to help with the City of Jackson’s water crisis.

He said in a tweet, “We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix. I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow. We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!”

--- Original Story Below---

Gov. Tate Reeves is denying reports that he has been dodging communication with Jackson’s Mayor Antar Lumumba.

This after an impassioned press conference Tuesday in which Lumumba discussed “chronicling” difficulties getting in touch with Reeves through the past year.

Lumumba also said that because of this “challenge” reaching the governor, he has resorted to contacting Reeves’ chief of staff because of their having a “prior relationship” and because this is the person Lumumba can get in contact with.

Reeves, though, denied these claims by Lumumba.

According to the governor, although he understands that Lumumba is experiencing a lot of pressure and is “getting attacked from all sides” due to the mass water outages impacting the Capital City, his saying that he couldn’t get in touch with Reeves “wasn’t accurate.”

“The first I heard from the mayor was at 1:38 p.m. yesterday afternoon via text,” Reeves stated. “I immediately responded. But all of that is semantics.”

The governor then shifted, saying that what is important is “getting the people that need help, help.”

Reeves said that many of the challenges facing Jackson are not new but were born over decades of negligence.

“That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something we are going to fix in the next six to eight hours,” he continued.

Reeves was later asked if he should have been the one reaching out to Lumumba first given that Reeves lives in Jackson and that he is the “state leader.”

“Well sure,” Reeves responded. “We reach out and talk to local officials all the time,” adding that he gets a status report every few hours on any unmet needs and any asks made of the state.

“I don’t think it would be fair to characterize it any other way than I have been fully aware on every-other-hour basis over the last ten days of the challenges that are faced in every community throughout our state,” Reeves said.

The governor also said that the people of Mississippi have a significant investment in the City of Jackson and that “it has not been easy to operate state government because of the lack of water” and made it clear that “the state does not run the water system in the City of Jackson.”

“Perhaps we should,” Reeves suggested. “Perhaps we oughta look at things to see what happens going forward...”

22,"Apr 30, 2021",Liberation News,"There is enough money to fix the pipes in Jackson, Mississippi – Liberation News","Representatives in Mississippi’s state legislature approved $3 million to repair the state’s water system including 46.7 million for the city of Jackson earlier this month. As of now, it is unclear how these funds will be spent.

Credit: CJ Nickell Templin

On April 13, the city approved $1.2 million to repair the O.B. Curtis water treatment facility. This was after it was revealed that the Environmental Protection Agency, sent an emergency administrative order demanding that the city to fix its water system.

The order detailed the city’s long standing water problems such as equipment failures and understaffing. It also cited health concerns like the potential for E. Coli and other pathogens in the water, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, cramps and headaches.

The money approved by the city council only repairs one facility, while these problems are in all of Jackson’s water treatment facilities.

Jackson City councilmember Kenneth Stokes has advocated for the privatization of Jackson’s water system. When talking about solutions, Stokes said, “If something different means we need to get private companies in here to run our water plant, then so be it.” (WLBT3)

But the solution is not privatization. When municipal water systems are privatized, water bills rise for the residents because state regulators let private companies earn a profit. Under capitalism, it is guaranteed that profit will be prioritized over public safety.

Because of privatization, pipes in Missoula, Mont., leaked so badly that half of the water flowing through its pipes was lost.

The truth is that all of the solutions offered by those in office are either not enough, or directly in conflict with the people’s interests. The city needs more funding and the money is there.

The money from the federal, state and local government is much less than the estimated $2 billion necessary to permanently fix the city’s damaged and aging water system. Lack of funding has been an issue for Jackson’s water infrastructure for decades.

For more than 40 years, federal funding for water infrastructure in cities all across the United States has decreased. In 1977, federal support accounted for 31 percent of cities’ total water utility spending. In the present day, it only accounts for 4 percent of spending. So for cities like Memphis, New Orleans, and Jackson, their pipes have been neglected for more than four decades. As a result, over 60 million people are exposed to unsafe drinking water each year. This is a longstanding health crisis that will take a lot of federal and state funding to resolve.

The water crisis that came as a result of February’s winter storm was the result of long term issues, and it will take comprehensive solutions to fix it. As mentioned before, it would take $2 billion to fix Jackson’s water system, making safe, and public drinking water for Jackson’s residents — not paying for water bottles or filters, just quality public water. This may be a basic necessity and human right, but where would we get the money? Why not look up at the people who suffered the least during Jackson’s water crisis. In addition, look where the city, state, and federal governments have already been spending money.

Mississippi has 47,279 millionaires. It would be safe to say that they have not been feeling the worst effects of Jackson’s water crisis. Just a 1 percent tax on them for the water pipes would produce $472 million. For Mississippi’s 2 billionaires, whose cumulative net worth amounts to $2 billion, a 2 percent tax would amount to approximately $40,000,000.

Now, let’s tax some corporate profits. The Mississippi-based Sanderson Farms, the third largest poultry producer in the United States, also produces $2.8 billion in annual profits. That is approximately an extra $40 million with a 2 percent tax.

Nationally, millionaires and billionaires saw their wealth go up by $1 trillion and collective net-worth increase by $4 trillion. A 2 percent tax on that collective net worth alone would amount to an additional $80 billion.

Just taxing the millionaires, billionaires, and Mississippi’s largest employers would be more than enough to fix Jackson’s pipes. This is much more than the $50 million that would be allocated to Jackson from the federal and state government.

But what is the local and state government spending money on? The budget for Jackson’s police department is approximately $32 million. Defunding Jackson’s police department by 25 percent would produce $8 million in revenue. The state also spends $2 million to CoreCivic, a private prison company that also houses undocumented immigrants. CoreCivic is notorious for its horrible conditions and human rights abuses in their facilities in Tallahatchie and Adams Counties; one example would be ICE agents torturing Cameroonian immigrants in Adams County. Another example would be 80 percent of inmates from Vermont testing positive for COVID-19 in Tallahatchie Correctional Facility. There are better uses for Mississippi’s money than to keep funding human rights abuses in Mississippi’s prisons; that money can go towards water and other much needed services.

On the federal level, the government definitely has the funding to repair Mississippi’s water system. The United States government’s “defense” budget is as high as the next seven countries’ military expenditures combined. Congress also gave $738 billion for defense spending, to bankroll war and occupation abroad.

The bottom line is that there is enough money to fix Jackson’s water problem; there is just not the political will from politicians at the city, state, and national level. In Mississippi, as with the United States as a whole, profits are prioritized over people. In order to reverse this reality, and get the rich, the corporations, and government to help fix Jackson’s pipes, then the people must start demanding the government to hand it over at all levels.","As mentioned before, it would take $2 billion to fix Jackson’s water system, making safe, and public drinking water for Jackson’s residents — not paying for water bottles or filters, just quality public water.

Garbage pickup

Waste Management has resumed regularly scheduled collection services, but is experiencing high volumes of garbage and trash along all routes, which may cause some delays in service. Any routes not completed on schedule will become first priority the next morning, the mayor's office said.

Waste Management said it anticipates all routes, including residential, commercial and roll-off, to be recovered by the end of the week.

The city is asking residents to only place household garbage out for both collection days this week in an effort to prevent heavy loads. It asks for residents to hold bulk items and yard debris for next week.

Waste Management will begin removing tree limbs and debris beginning next week.

Residents are asked to call the city's solid waste department at 601-960-1193 for more information.

Numbers to call

The city says it is still overwhelmed by calls to 311. It advises residents to reserve calls to the city hotline for water main breaks.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

Eddie Staten pushed a grocery cart nearly a mile to the Mississippi College School of Law on Sunday for one reason — to find clean water.

Staten is one of the thousands of people in Jackson who were affected by the massive water outage after two winter storms swept through Mississippi in mid-February. Nearly three weeks later, pockets of the city still have no service.

He's one of the luckier ones — his water has returned. But Staten said his pressure is low and his toilet still doesn't flush. And sometimes when he turns the faucet on, the water comes out brown.

""We don't drink (tap water) because we don't trust it,"" Staten said. ""Everybody said it's contaminated and not to drink it.""

The latest on Jackson's water crisis: Officials say progress being made as residents still without water

Staten and others like him are the reason Jeffery Land, a Memphis, Tennessee, attorney, organized members of the Leo Bearman, Sr. American Inn of Courts — an organization of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals — to come together to bring more than 1,900 cases of bottled water to Jackson.

When the storms hit, Land said he was also under a boil water advisory, but his problems resolved after a few days. He said he's never heard of an outage lasting nearly as long as the one in Jackson and felt compelled to help.

""I saw the news story and figured I needed to do something,"" he said.

Land said after talking with others in the organization, he spoke with his father, Jeff Land, and began coordinating how to bring water to the Charles Clark American Inn of Courts in Jackson.

Jeff Land said the organization acquired the water in a matter of days and a local trucking company — Milan Supply Chain Solutions — offered to transport it.

""I sent a text to the CEO, Michael McLarty, ... and he called me three minutes later and said it's a done deal,"" he said.

Land was able to set up a distribution site in the parking lot of the Mississippi College School of Law on East Griffith Street because the college hosts the Jackson branch. Only 30 minutes after distribution started, organizers estimated 50 cars had already come through to get water.

Land isn't the only person to bring outside help to Jackson. The New Orleans Pelicans basketball team donated two truckloads of water on Monday, which were distributed by the city. The athletics department at the University of Mississippi, in partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, also hosted a water drive during its recent series of baseball games against Belmont to contribute to the cause.

District 4 Chancery Court Judge Crystal Wise Martin, who was at the site Sunday with her family to help with distribution, said it felt good to see people willing to come together to help Jackson when it needed it the most.

""I'm just so warm that people are coming out ... to help people,"" she said. ""That's what life is really all about.""

During a news conference Friday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said pressure at the plant was improving and only pockets in south Jackson were still without service. Testing of the city's well water system to see if the boil advisory can be lifted began Friday. The surface water system will be tested when pressure levels stay stable for at least 48 hours, officials said.

Water supply has been returned to many who lost it during last week's snow and ice storms across the South, officials reported.

And boil-water advisories are starting to evaporate across southwestern Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, the officials said.

But a water-fueled political spat in capitol city Jackson, Mississippi, grew in intensity as the mayor and a council member traded accusations in dueling press conferences.

""This is probably the most optimistic I've been all week,"" Memphis Light, Gas and Water CEO J.T. Young said Wednesday afternoon at a press conference.

The utility issued a boil water advisory last Thursday after extreme cold temperatures gripped much of the Mid-South.

The combination of customers leaving their faucets running to prevent them from freezing, dozens of broken water mains, and frozen reservoirs led to low water pressure across the city.

28,"Feb 28, 2021",WLBT,‘Our system basically crashed like a computer:’ Jackson Public Works Dir. said progress made in restoring water to residents,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson provided an update on the ongoing water crisis that began following a lengthy winter storm.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba gave an update Sunday discussing efforts to restore water to residents who’ve been without it for nearly two weeks.

The mayor and public works director say the city is making progress when it comes to fully restoring everyone’s water.

However, right now some residents in South and West Jackson are still without water, and at this time Lumumba said he can’t give an exact date on when it’ll be restored.

“Time is really the solution to much of this,” the mayor said. “While we can’t give you a precise day and hour in which that water will come on, what we’re confident in is that they are working the system as it should be, they are resolving the issues.”

The city says the water system is slowly making progress.

Williams says the pressure has reached 90 psi (pounds per square inch) and they are working to stabilize the pressure.

“Water has been restored to certain areas, what we’re trying to narrow down is, where are those areas that are still possibly without water,” said Williams. “Right now what we know is there are some pockets in West Jackson, and there are some areas in South Jackson.”

The public works director says they’re now trying to get enough water pressure to fill the more than a dozen storage tanks throughout the city.

This will then allow water to migrate down to the homes in South and West Jackson that currently have no water.

“We just left Forest Hill Road, so those residents are without,” said Williams. “We also left the area of Brookleigh and they’re without water currently right now. We know that we need to continue to push pressure through the system and flow water down consistently in order to continue to build the restoration efforts for getting our residents water, so that’s just part of the entire recovery.”

The entire city has been under a Boil Water Alert for more than two weeks and those with water have been asked to conserve.

“Our system basically crashed like a computer and we’re trying to rebuild it,” said Williams.

The city is making efforts to deliver water to those in need. Sites have been set up across the city for residents to pick up free water.

Governor Tate Reeves has activated the National Guard to help speed up the recovery efforts for the city’s water system.

As this crisis continues, it sheds another light on the city’s aging infrastructure.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said recently that it would literally cost more than a billion dollars to replace the entire water system.

He has been vocal about criticism to the city’s response to the crisis saying that what caused the outages and warnings was not incompetence but “an act of God.”

Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday spelled out significant concerns with the city's water system, including necessary fixes to maintain safe drinking water, following the worst water crisis Jackson has seen in recent history.

EPA administrators in their first public appearance with city officials said it will take both short-term and long-term fixes to remedy the system, a prospect that will require millions of dollars of funding.

The visit follows an inspection by the federal agency, along with the state Department of Health, in February of last year that found several severe violations at the city's two water treatment plants, the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility and the J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Facility.

The health department, which oversees water quality across the state, later referred the inspection findings back to the EPA to take the lead on enforcement, and the EPA sent the city a list of required fixes, although no time table was cited.

The deficiencies at the plant, which ranged from a shortage of operators to malfunctioning equipment, raised immediate concerns about the reliability of the system to provide safe drinking water, said Carol Kemker, the director of the Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division of the agency.

City unveils water billing plan: Plan to overhaul Jackson's water billing system two months away, consultant says

The concerns prompted an emergency order under the Safe Drinking Water Act, she warned the council, which is meant to stem ""an impending dangerous condition from materializing or reduce or eliminate a dangerous situation.""

The city will be under the order until the EPA determines all violations have been rectified. Neither Kemker nor city officials said when they expect that to happen. The city will likely have to address the order in both the short-term and long-term, meaning it could be years before Jackson gets a clean bill of health from the agency, she said.

""It will take several years to complete work necessary to repair and rehabilitate the drinking water system here,"" she said.

While most of the violations cited the city's treatment plants, Kemker said the EPA was concerned with the city's water quality, in particular the level of turbidity, or cloudiness, and sediment in the water system that can contain or conceal bacteria and viruses.

But when asked, she said the water in Jackson is safe to drink.

""The water is safe to drink in the immediate time frame. We'd like to try and minimize the boil water notices,"" she said.

Kemker said the city has notified the EPA of its progress on fixing the system, as required by federal law, and the two parties meet twice weekly to determine the steps to fix the city's system.

The city's sewage system is under a close to billion dollar consent decree from the EPA for violations of the Clean Water Act.

The mayor's administration requested $47 million worth of funding from the state to address the specific deficiencies listed by the EPA in the midst of the water crisis. It has also applied for federal grants. The city was recently awarded over $43 million in coronavirus-related funds from the federal government as part of the American Rescue Plan. The funds can be used toward water infrastructure, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The inspection and subsequent warning preceded the water crisis leading to questions of whether it could have been prevented.

Public Works Director Charles Williams maintains the system was bound to crash given the scale of the issues and the lack of funding to address them.

Freezing temperatures crippled the city's water treatment plants leading to the worst water crisis in recent history. While other cities suffered similar problems with their water systems, some Jackson residents remained without water for weeks, and a citywide boil water notice extended for nearly a month.

But while the Texas blackouts dominated the news cycle, Jackson’s water crises received far less attention, even as it extended into its fourth week. Jackson’s residents, 80 percent of whom are Black and nearly 30 percent of whom live below the poverty line, have been forced to boil water to drink, bathe, and use the bathroom. They’ve collected rainwater to flush their toilets and bought bottled water to brush their teeth. In the middle of a pandemic, residents of Jackson haven’t had reliable access to clean water to wash their hands.

This water crisis was years in the making. For the past 50 years the Republican-led state government has been cutting taxes and neglecting to invest in infrastructure repairs. Jackson’s shrinking tax base has been exacerbated by white flight and the fact that, unlike other capital cities, Jackson doesn’t make money off property taxes for state-owned buildings. The city of Jackson has a $300 million budget. According to Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Jackson’s wastewater and drinking water systems require at least $2 billion of repairs.

“It isn’t a matter of if these systems will fail, it’s a matter of when these systems will fail,” Lumumba tells Nathalie Baptiste on the Mother Jones Podcast. “Pipes were bursting throughout the system because they are over 100 years. They’re like peanut brittle.”

On March 17, the city of Jackson Mississippi finally lifted its boil water notice. But Jackson’s water crisis laid bare the budget, infrastructure, and equity issues that leave cities like Jackson vulnerable to future extreme weather events.

“Climate change is significantly impacting the pressure on our infrastructure. We have hotter summers, colder winters, and more rain in the rainy season,” say’s Mayor Lumumba. “They’re becoming our new normal.”","In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water.

31,"Mar 16, 2021",Mississippi Today,Hyde-Smith proposes federal funding to address Jackson water crisis,"In response to the ongoing water crisis in Jackson, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced legislation Tuesday that would authorize federal funding for water infrastructure upgrades.

The Emergency Water Infrastructure Improvements Act taps three federal agencies to provide the city with a combination of loans, loan forgiveness and grants for water infrastructure projects. This federal response comes as state lawmakers weigh their options for addressing the crisis in the final weeks of the 2021 legislative session.

“Providing safe and reliable drinking water is a local responsibility, but there are federal programs and funds available that can be used to address these types of problems. I cannot sit back and watch Jackson schools, businesses and residents go without water,” Hyde-Smith said in a press release announcing the bill.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and tens of thousands of residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, city officials say “most” residents have had water service restored, though the entire city is still under a boil water notice.

Jxn's water woes became a crisis with the Feb. ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglect. I’ve introduced legislation to authorize a federal approach to help the @CityOfJxnMS work toward fixing the problem… — U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (@SenHydeSmith) March 16, 2021

In her announcement, Hyde-Smith joined the chorus of elected officials misrepresenting the current crisis as solely a failure of local leadership.

“The weeks of hardship on Jackson residents is upsetting and completely unacceptable. Jackson’s water woes became a crisis with the February ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglecting necessary repairs and maintenance,” Hyde-Smith said. “It’s time to put that neglect behind us and work toward fixing the problem.”

Under Hyde-Smith’s bill, different levels and types of funding would come through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Economic Development Administration (EDA). Here’s what each of them would provide:

An additional $22 million in funding will be authorized for Jackson under the Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program.

The Corps would be able to use these additional funds to assist in the design and construction of environmental infrastructure projects.

An additional $150 million in funding will be added to the EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF). With these funds, the EPA makes grants to States, which in turn issues loans to municipalities for drinking water improvements.

It is unclear how much of this funding would be directed to Mississippi, much less Jackson. The entire state of Mississippi received just $26,315,000 of the $2.7 billion in DWSRF funding made available in 2020.

Public water systems deemed eligible for this additional funding will be designated as “disadvantaged communities,” which qualifies them for loan subsidization and principal forgiveness. Eligible systems are also required to be located within states that had at least five major disasters in 2020 and suffered damages to water systems in recent winter storms.

The bill also stipulates that a maximum of 15% of these DWSRF funds can be used to purchase and install new water meters and modernize water billing systems. The city is currently running at a deficit of around $2 million each month in water collections revenue after a failed contract with the company Siemens left the city with more faulty water meters and billing issues than the city had before hiring them to overhaul these systems.

The bill directs the Secretary of Commerce to direct no less than $25 million in EDA Economic Adjustment Assistance(EAA) grant funds to “eligible systems.”

This funding would come from EAA grant funding from the CARES Act that has yet to be appropriated.

Other Mississippi lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to sign on to Hyde-Smith’s proposal. In her announcement, Hyde-Smith emphasized a need for bipartisan support to get the legislation passed.

“It is a responsible and worthwhile plan that will require the support of the Democrats in Congress and the administration to get it done, and I look forward to their cooperation,” Hyde-Smith said.

A combination of bad weather and failed infrastructure meant thousands of people in the mostly Black city of Jackson spent weeks without the essential resource in February and early March. Residents had to rely on donated water for everyday tasks. While it seems like Jackson’s immediate water crisis is getting resolved, many Black communities in the rural South and elsewhere struggle to get access to clean water every day. It’s a complicated problem that doesn’t get the same national attention as other racial justice priorities.

On Friday’s episode of A Word, I spoke with Catherine Coleman Flowers, who is working to change that. She’s the author of Waste: One Woman’s Fight Against America’s Dirty Secret and a winner of a 2020 MacArthur “Genius Grant.” Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Jason Johnson: What are some of the issues with infrastructure, communication, and government that led to this happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is actually a state capital?

Catherine Coleman Flowers: What’s happening in Jackson is not unusual. I believe that what we will find in a lot of these areas, especially in the South, is the type of benign neglect of these cities. Benign neglect means there’s an intentional avoidance of putting the type of dollars in infrastructure—in these Southern communities, it’s not coming from the tax base because the tax base is not there. A lot of it comes from the federal government, but it’s those cities that have lobbyists or political connections that get the money over and over again. We have to change that paradigm.

One of the things that I’ve read about Jackson was the mayor was quoted and he talks about how brittle the pipes were. The infrastructure that was probably put in Jackson was put in there when Jackson was white predominantly. It probably has not been replaced, and the local community cannot afford to replace it. But we have to do something about this because Jackson’s not the only one. It’s like with Flint and the lead problem. Flint was just the canary in the coal mine. There’s lead issues throughout the United States that have not been addressed. And likewise, there are infrastructure water issues throughout the United States. When you look at Jackson, Jackson was also the convergence of poor infrastructure and climate change. We’re going to see more climate events, but these extreme weather patterns are going to expose, like COVID did, all of these disparities as it relates to infrastructure issues.

Have you seen climate change make clean water access even harder for rural Black communities?

Yes, in California, Allensworth in the Central Valley, because of the water being used by the farming industry there. There’s a Black community that historically was the first Black community in California funded by Black folk, and now, they can’t drink the water because the water is full of arsenic that’s naturally forming. The parts of the arsenic is greater than the parts of the water, so therefore, they can’t drink it.

So when it comes to this kind of activism, we always hear about famous white women. They get movies. We have Silkwood. We’ve got Erin Brockovich. But we don’t hear often about the Black women who are on the ground doing this kind of work. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you saw in Lowndes County, Alabama, and how your activism began on environmental justice issues?

Advertisement

Well, my activism began on environmental justice issues because I came from activist parents. When I moved back to Lowndes County in 2000, I ran into the fact that there were Black people that were being arrested because they could not afford an on-site septic system. A lot of the people that are in rural communities are not in incorporated areas. All the laws are written to support municipalities, but in a rural community, generally, there’s no wastewater treatment, no decentralized system. I live in Montgomery, Alabama, and we have a decentralized system, and all I had to do when I bought a house was just move into the house and pay to have my water turned on. Or if I was building a house in Montgomery, it would just connect to the decentralized system.

“When infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities.” — Catherine Coleman Flowers

However, in rural communities like Lowndes County, the homeowner is responsible for their own decentralized system. These systems in Lowndes County are very, very expensive, especially if you’re a poor family. To give you an example, last year we were trying to work with a family prior to COVID to get a septic system for them. They built down 25 inches, in this case, and struck water. The system that she would have needed would have cost $28,000. You don’t go to the bank and borrow that. Even if it’s $6,000 for a septic system, there’s no financing for it. A mobile home can come with the plumbing, the indoor plumbing, the toilets. You can connect it to a straight pipe or PVC pipe and have it protruding from the home. When they flush the toilet, it goes out on top of the ground. That’s one of the things, and they have criminalized that here in the state of Alabama and in a lot of states. Then the second problem is people that have septic systems that have failed. When they fail, they can also be criminalized for that. I got involved back in 2002. I had gone to visit a husband and wife who had been arrested because they had a failing septic system. And then later, we found out that there were lots of people in the county that either had already been arrested or were facing arrest because they did not have a working septic system. So I got involved by stopping the criminalization, at least in Lowndes County, of poor people who could not afford on-site sanitation.

It would seem to me also that this is a structural issue. Because as Black folk were segregated or kept out of certain neighborhoods in certain places in the South, they weren’t able to live in places that were incorporated that had plumbing systems. So you’re not only being punished through white supremacy and segregation forcing you out, but you’re then being fined and criminalized again when you have to provide resources for yourself that other people are getting through tax money.

Yes, Montgomery at one point was one of the top slave trading places in this country. That is why the lynching memorial, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, is located in Montgomery. When you walk from the river in Montgomery and walk down Commerce Street, those buildings, a lot of them, were slaveholding pens. People were auctioned off at Court Square, which is not far from the Rosa Parks Museum.

Advertisement

Those of us that are part of that heritage, our families ended up in places like Lowndes County. When I go back and look at the census records, I see that our families have been there since the early 1800s, in some cases. So these rural communities, there’s a legacy and traditions where there are churches and schools and graveyards where people have been there forever. But when infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities, and the communities that were left out were those communities of color. That is a major problem that we see in the South around infrastructure and environmental justice.

Catherine, you’ve worked with Democrats and Republicans. I mean, on all sides. You’ve worked with Bernie Sanders. You worked with [former Alabama Senator] Jeff Sessions, who’s the last person on the planet who I would ever think would care anything about the struggles of rural Black people. I got to ask you, when you’re dealing with these powerful political leaders in and out of office, when they come to you and say, “What can I do to help?,” what’s the first thing that you tell them?

Advertisement

With Jeff Sessions, the way it happened, I just happened to be at a town hall meeting. I was the economic development coordinator for the county. He was a U.S. senator, and he talked about the type of grants that were available. And then I asked the question, “You mentioned these grants, but how do poor communities get access to them if they have to pay a match?” He came to me afterward and said, “I’ve always wanted to know the answer to that. I’m from Wilcox County, Alabama. I grew up poor. We didn’t have a television in our house until I was 10 years of age.” That’s how we started our conversation. We had to be human first. And from that point, he was very helpful. Hyundai had decided it was going to locate in Alabama, in Montgomery. At that time, when they decided to locate there, the state officials weren’t taking them to Lowndes County at all. When they had the groundbreaking ceremony, everybody was from Eastern Alabama, and there was nobody with a shovel that was Black. All the Black people kind of huddled together and everybody was saying, “Lowndes County’s right over there. Why is there nobody here from Lowndes County with a shovel?” Ultimately, I was able to help recruit tier 1 suppliers to Hyundai to Lowndes County. But we needed the infrastructure. We didn’t have industrial development parks or anything like that. Sen. Sessions was very helpful in that.

Advertisement

In terms of Bernie Sanders, he actually came to visit Lowndes County. He went to the home of Pamela Rush, who I write about in my book. I felt that you cannot understand inequality unless you see it for yourself. So to come into her home and see how she was living in a dilapidated mobile home that she still owed money on, that did not appreciate in value—living with two children, one child sleeping on a CPAP machine—Bernie Sanders said to me, “Catherine, now I understand when you talk about the intersection of climate change and environmental justice and racial justice.” Because I told his people, “I have to plan this trip because I want to make sure it’s not going to be a photo-op. He’s going to actually go and see people and see the situation so that he can know what kind of policies we need to have in place to address this.” I didn’t have an ask other than for him to come and see. And then once he saw and he was looking at what resources or what ways he could potentially help, and it has led to a shift in government policy that I could not have even imagined when I made that request for him to come and see.

33,"Mar 16, 2021",Forbes,"Jackson, Mississippi, Hasn't Had Clean Water For A Month After Winter Storm","Topline

Most residents of Jackson, Mississippi—the state's capital and largest city—have now gone an entire month without access to clean water in their homes, as a citywide boil water advisory remains in place after a historic winter storm last month, which crippled a water system Jackson officials said had been neglected for decades.

Key Facts

Boil water advisories first went out in Jackson on Feb. 16 after a massive winter storm and record-breaking cold took a major toll on infrastructure across the South. While other major water and power systems have managed to come back online across the region, testing in Jackson has continued to show the system isn't clear of potentially having dangerous organisms, leading to the boil water advisory remaining in place. Many residents went without access to running water at all or dealt with low water pressure after the winter storm, leading to distribution centers being set up for residents to retrieve water to bathe with or flush their toilets. Running water has been restored to nearly all residents, but a small number have continued to go without, according to the Clarion-Ledger. Officials hope to lift the boil water advisory in the coming days, the newspaper reported.

Big Number

43,000. That's how many households use the city's surface water system, all of whom have been asked to boil water before use. Those households—many of which having multiple people living under the same roof—represent much of the city's approximately 160,000 residents. A well-based water system serving about 16,000 customers in the southern part of Jackson and neighboring Byram, Mississippi, was cleared of the boil water advisory last week.

What To Watch For

City officials, including Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D), have blamed years of neglect and a declining tax base over the years caused by white flight as contributing to a water system that was ill-prepared for the winter weather. On March 3, Lumumba reportedly sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves (R) requesting $47 million to improve the city's water system.

Surprising Fact

Reeves has not yet put in a request for a federal disaster declaration, according to the Clarion-Ledger. He has until Sunday to do so.

Key Background

February brought a rare series of winter storms across the South and a deep freeze during the middle of the month which broke some record lows that had stood for more than a century. The record cold would take a heavy toll on infrastructure systems ill-prepared for those conditions. One of the clearest examples came from Texas, where the state's electrical grid was pushed to the brink of complete failure, leading to rolling blackouts for millions. The aftermath has seen political battles over the state's electrical grid, lawsuits over excessive electric bills and major electric companies filing for bankruptcy.

35,"Mar 26, 2021",WBUR,"The Jackson, Mississippi Water Crisis And America's Crumbling Water System","""And the city itself, because, like so many cities in the U.S., because of flight, and disinvestment and losing the tax base. And in this case, losing 40,000 residents, taking us from 200,000 to 160,000. But we still have a huge land mass of city with these outdated pipes under them. So we can't pay, we can't afford to keep it up. ... It's a systemic breakdown of federal, state and local municipal areas being able to work together to solve problems together on basic things like infrastructure.""

Donna Ladd : “To use words that my reporter Nick Judin used, it's a complex system collapse. And when we say that, it's not just the technological part of the system. It's the fact that we've known this for years, it's coming in one way or another. I mean, we know it. There was a big 2013 study that warned about all of these things. So we know the conditions of them. But there's a systemic breakdown in the willingness to actually do something about it.

For a month, residents of Jackson, Mississippi went without clean running water. The city's mayor says the problem's decades in the making. That makes Jackson a lesson for the entire country. We talk America's crumbling water system.

What has the city of Jackson done over the past couple of decades to attend to this known problem?

Donna Ladd: “I think the best way to break it down is to say staunching the bleeding, Band-Aid approach as far as the city itself is concerned. I mean, I can't ... sit here and blame a city that is as beleaguered as our city has been for not having the resources to be able to overhaul the water system.

""Some of the numbers that we've come up with, the least amount that they need is $600 million. And then, as you said earlier, it keeps climbing from there. I mean, if the money's not here, the money's not here. So what that means is that the state should be at the same table with the city, side by side. This is the capital city.

“You know, the state is no stronger than its capital city. That's absurd. And so they should be side by side with the city saying, OK, how are we going to work together to get federal help? What is it that we can do? How can we help? But the opposite happens. You know, one of the things our governor said just recently was, Well, you know, Jackson residents should pay their water bill, so they should go collect the water bill.

""Well, there's a whole issue around faulty billing that we've been through. But beyond that, it's like the city tried to get the state, and the state legislature passed legislation to allow payment plans for the water bill. And the governor vetoed it last year. And so that's like working against us, and so the money doesn't come in. But the water billing money is not enough to pay for what we're talking about here.

""And we have to work with the federal government, as we've discovered. A lot of the disinvestment and helping municipal areas across the country came during the '80s and particularly the Reagan era. Which was kind of pulling back on financial assistance, for environmental improvements, those kinds of things. And that is one of those perfect storm moments where it got so much worse afterwards as far as not being able to pay for things. And so when you've got everybody working against each other, or ignoring each other, then it's a terrible situation.""

We keep using this phrase 'crumbling.' Is that a fair description of some of these water systems?

Aaron Packman: ""Most of the infrastructure we have in the eastern half of the United States is quite old. Just for point of comparison, I live in Chicago. We're still using the water intakes from Lake Michigan that were built in the 1960s. And in places like Philadelphia, the water infrastructure goes back 300 years. So clearly infrastructure that age needs a lot of maintenance to work properly. And it's very hard to do, because most of the pipes are underground and inaccessible. So we definitely have an issue with its aging, deteriorating water infrastructure in a lot of the country.”

Where should early targets be for the federal government if it's going to pump a whole lot of money into infrastructure?

Catherine Coleman-Flowers: “First of all, those people that never got the infrastructure should get it first. So, I mean, in this conversation we were talking about municipalities when most of the United States is rural. And most of them are not in municipalities. So should they still be denied access to infrastructure, especially water and wastewater infrastructure? And we're seeing in some places, I'm actually doing a project right now with The Guardian where we are documenting wastewater problems throughout the United States, it's not just a one situation. It's not just Jackson, Mississippi. It's not just even Detroit, which is having a lot of issues and water shut offs.

""And if we shut off the water, you shut off sanitation. And I think the other thing that we have to do is make sure that the policy makers, if we're going to have solutions, we cannot separate wastewater from water. Because a lot of people in their mind, because they can flush the toilets, they assume that everybody else in the U.S. can do the same thing. That's the reason why we were able to do a study to show that there was hookworm in Lowndes County. And it's probably in other areas, too. We just haven't looked for it yet. So that's the first thing we need to do, give it to places that don't have it.

""We also need to identify where those places are. There are no accurate numbers on how many people do not have wastewater sanitation, because that was taken off the census in the 1990s. So if we're going to make decisions based on what numbers we have, we're still going to leave a lot of people behind. And a lot of these people are in rural communities, or they are poor people or people of color. And we have to unpack and unfold that.

""And I think we can't talk about infrastructure, and where the dollars are going or where they have gone, unless we deal with the social justice issues around those decisions. Because to people who are not like me, they see it just as simply a political decision. But socially, it has an impact on people that look like me. And we need to make sure that our voices are heard and that part of the solution is getting those dollars to those communities that have been left behind.”

Aaron Packman: ""This is a rare opportunity, because you don't usually have these problems get elevated to the presidential level and a commitment to make an investment. So I would advocate for modernization of our wastewater treatment facilities, a lot of which used 50-year-old plus technology. And also fixing some of the hard problems with the water distribution system and also the wastewater system, the things that are less accessible, that often get ignored and are not fully maintained. So this will be expensive, but it will make a big difference.""

36,"Feb 19, 2021",The Guardian,Biden to declare major disaster in Texas as millions hit by water shortages,"Joe Biden said on Friday he was ready to declare a major disaster in Texas after a deadly winter storm cut power and disrupted water supplies for millions across the state.

Biden said the declaration, which follows a request from the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, would open up broader federal aid for immediate and long-term recovery efforts.

A presidential visit to the state is being planned for next week.

“As I said when I ran, I’m going to be a president for all Americans,” said Biden, who won November’s election without winning Texas, of his plans. “If I can do it without creating a burden for folks, I plan on going.”

Biden has asked his team to expedite Texas’s request for a disaster declaration, clearing the way for more federal resources, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters.

The White House later said in a statement that Biden called the acting administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), Bob Fenton, to let him know he would approve the measure as soon as the agency forwarded a formal request.

The White House has been in touch with mayors in Texas cities, including Houston and Austin, and officials in Dallas and other counties, to make sure they were connected to Fema and had access to federal government resources, an administration official said separately.

As cold weather began to abate in Texas, power was being restored across the state, but millions of people remained without safe drinking water throughout the US south as the region struggled to recover from a crippling week of winter weather.

About 370,000 households remained without power in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday morning, with millions in the region under water-boil advisories, after record low temperatures damaged pipes and infrastructure throughout the southern United States.

In Texas, almost half the state’s residents, about 13 million people, remained under boil advisories, with over 700 water supply systems affected, according to an update from the Texas commission on environmental quality on Thursday. In Austin alone, the state’s capital, the city reported losing 325m gallons of water due to burst pipes.

In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city’s 150,000 residents were without water on Thursday night. Jackson’s mayor, Antar Lumumba, told a press conference the city faced a shortage of chemicals to treat the water, despite pumping efforts to refill city tanks.

In Louisiana, about a million residents were without clean water on Thursday, with 98 water supply systems out across the state, according to the governor, John Bel Edwards. On Thursday, Biden approved a disaster declaration for the state. The president authorized a similar disaster declaration for Texas earlier in the week, allowing Fema to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state.

Late on Thursday, Abbott announced the state had sought another major disaster declaration which would “allow eligible Texans to apply for assistance to help address broken pipes and related property damage”, according to a press release.

Abbott also announced he would ask the legislature “to mandate the winterization of Texas’s power system and for the legislature to ensure the necessary funding for winterization”.

The frigid temperatures have moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the north-east as the extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 58 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond and 17-year-old Oklahoma girl who fell into a frozen pond.

A growing number of people have died trying to keep warm. In and around the west Texas city of Abilene, authorities said six people died of the cold – including a 60-year-old man found dead in his bed. In the Houston area, a family died from carbon monoxide poisoning as their car idled in their garage.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas used rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. But the remaining Texas outages were mostly weather-related, according to the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Fenton, Fema’s acting director, said on Friday that teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on CBS This Morning, while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

Rotating outages for Texas could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, said Dan Woodfin, the council’s senior director of system operations.

The crisis is exacerbating and demonstrating the chronic inequality in Texas and across the region. In Houston authorities reported that the mass power and water outages led to more than 500 complaints from residents of price gouging costs for water, gas and rent, double the number of grievances lodged at the start of the pandemic, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, a spokeswoman said.

And across Texas’s vast prison network inmates complained of sub-zero temperatures and stagnant, overflowing toilets, according to local reports.

Meanwhile, the Republican senator Ted Cruz continued to face a backlash for traveling to a Mexican resort city in the middle of the crisis. Cruz returned to Texas from his very brief trip to Cancún on Thursday. He has called the trip a “mistake”.

“We’re not spending any time, energy or breath analyzing Senator Cruz’s whereabouts or his group chat,” Psaki said.","Joe Biden said on Friday he was ready to declare a major disaster in Texas after a deadly winter storm cut power and disrupted water supplies for millions across the state.

37,"Mar 29, 2021",Brookings Institution,"In Jackson, Miss., a water crisis has revealed the racial costs of legacy infrastructure","For nearly five weeks beginning in mid-February, parts of Jackson, Miss.—the state’s capital and most populous city—faced a water crisis. Two consecutive storms hit the city and led to prolonged freezing temperatures, causing pipes to burst. Thousands of residents were under a boil-water advisory, which was finally lifted on March 18.

Even before the storms hit, Jackson’s water system was a crisis in the making. “The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped,” said Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba on the structural challenges of paying for deferred infrastructure maintenance and legacy costs. “This is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson…we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state.”

Jackson’s crisis is tied to its inability to proactively invest in infrastructure upgrades. This inability stems from its ongoing economic and fiscal difficulties—a challenge that many other localities and water utilities face. In addition to a declining population, Jackson’s high percentage of low-income residents—in one of the poorest states in the country—limits steady and predictable revenues for public services, including drinking water and wastewater. Simply charging more for these services isn’t easy either, given widespread affordability issues. Mayor Lumumba has attempted to address these issues through new revenue sources—building off efforts of his predecessor and father Chokwe Lumumba, who died in office in 2014—but significant hurdles remain in addressing the estimated $2 billion backlog in needed water repairs.

This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs. Overlooking the impacts of uneven infrastructure on different types of households, especially by race and income, is a big part of that failure.

Jackson is a city with one of the largest shares of Black people in America, in the Blackest state in the union. Ideally, infrastructure serves as a shared foundation for economic, environmental, and public health between different neighborhoods and municipalities; however, infrastructure is often poorly maintained or intentionally overlooked in particular places, leading to a lack of access, affordability, and safety for many communities of color. Forward-looking infrastructure plans and projects designed to reduce risks, manage costs, and provide long-lasting benefits require different jurisdictions to work across economic and racial lines—something Mississippi has historically struggled to do. And since infrastructure is designed to be long-lived, these inequitable systems are also long-lived.

In the case of Jackson, legacy infrastructure goes hand-in-hand with a legacy of racism. The costs of legacy infrastructure parallel long-standing economic and racial disparities in the region. Without steady economic growth and shared economic opportunity—in jobs, wages, and other activity—municipalities and water utilities struggle to predictably and equitably generate enough revenue to cover their infrastructure needs. According to Brookings’s Metro Monitor, the Jackson metro area has only increased jobs by 6.6% and gross metropolitan product by 12.4% from 2009 to 2019—ranking 46th and 44th, respectively, out of the country’s 57 large metro areas with at least 500,000 residents. Over the same period, median wages in Jackson declined by 7.6%, the worst of all large metro areas. And while Jackson is closing the employment gap between people of color and white residents, it still ranks 55th out of 57 when it comes to closing the employment gap between the most advantaged and least advantaged neighborhoods.

Jackson’s water crisis was only the latest in a series of acute and chronic challenges. Past winters have seen broken water mains and business closures, while concerns over water quality, access, and affordability have persisted as well. Last year, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River, in addition to 6 billion gallons of minimally treated sewage. And similar to cities such as Flint, Mich., lead pollution has been a concern. In 2016, Jackson warned citizens to take precautions about lead levels in water, but instead of replacing all pipes—a move that could cost billions of dollars that the city does not have—it moved forward with a lower-cost corrosion control contract. In turn, homeowners are continuing to bear responsibility for lead pipes and other health risks even while some are unable to pay for existing bills; in 2019, the city announced it would turn off water for 20,000 residents in an attempt to collect $45 million in back bills.

As the graphic below shows, water-related expenditures in Jackson have become increasingly untethered to revenues. Because the city has not made long-term and continued investments in its infrastructure, sporadic crises have led to increasingly expensive repairs.

Rising costs and declining revenues—combined with a lack of proactive infrastructure planning and investment in particular neighborhoods of need—have put Jackson in a difficult position. Present and past infrastructure decisions—not only around drinking water and wastewater, but also roadways, mass transit, electricity, and broadband—can lock in structural inequities. Black-majority places such as Jackson, Baltimore, Detroit, and Flint are burdened by both a legacy of infrastructure and racism, setting the stage for future tragedies.

But just as infrastructure can lead to long-lasting costs, it can also be a foundation for long-lasting benefits. Better defining and addressing Jackson’s legacy infrastructure challenges can chart a new path. That requires public and private leaders at the state, regional, and city level—including water utilities—to talk about future and existing infrastructure needs in terms of the most vulnerable households, engage with a greater variety of residents, and test new projects and ideas. For instance, more coordinated “One Water” planning efforts can bridge policy and investment gaps among municipal leaders while involving community-based organizations, workforce development bodies, and other groups that have long been ignored. Better measuring water affordability needs and launching more robust customer assistance programs can make a difference too. And seeking more resilient solutions, including green infrastructure upgrades, can lead to lasting economic and environmental returns.

It looks like President Joe Biden’s next policy priority will be infrastructure. The administration would be wise to acknowledge that simply spending more money is not necessarily the solution. Instead, they should ensure that money is spent to maintain and rebuild the legacy infrastructure that has historically failed Black communities like those in Jackson.","This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs.

Jackson residents are among those in this country who have experienced firsthand the suffering caused when water infrastructure fails.

More than 100 water main breaks recently forced tens of thousands of Jackson residents to go without running water for weeks in February and March – the third collapse of our water infrastructure since 2010.

Last May, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River. Many in our community still rely on lead pipes that pose serious health hazards.

All of these problems require serious investments to fix. But solutions to the gaps in Jackson’s water system require more than stopgap measures; they need sustained and thoughtful investment from all levels of government, the private sector and our residents. The American Jobs Plan may just be what our city has been crying out for, and it’s time we communicate loud and clear about what we need to fix what is broken.

Until now, the city of Jackson and its residents have been forced to tackle the bulk of the estimated $2 billion water infrastructure spending gap we face alone. Even with a proposed one percent sales tax hike to raise revenue for the city’s water and sewer system, we won’t come close to raising the funding we need.

The $47 million that Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called for in a letter to our state and federal representatives would throw us a critical lifeline — but it won’t be a substitute for the overhaul we actually need.

Let’s be clear. Many in our community are struggling to make ends meet, facing expensive water bills while also having to manage the impacts of failing infrastructure. These burdens are an especially pressing threat to the livelihoods of already vulnerable populations and people of color.

If we are serious about investing in infrastructure in Jackson, then we need to start by taking a long and hard look at how we equitably appropriate resources.

Jackson is also not unique. Communities across the country are facing their own structural challenges when it comes to water infrastructure: lead pipes, outdated equipment, lack of resources for backup generators, and a host of other issues keep us from being able to deliver clean and safe water to all of our residents.

Mississippi’s congressional delegation needs to stand up for the residents of Jackson. The Senate recently passed the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, which gives all of us hope. We now need that spirit of bipartisanship and compromise to carry us through.

Our systems are failing us, and without immediate and holistic support from the federal government, they will continue to crumble around us and put lives at risk.

We can’t afford any delay in passing an infrastructure package that is going to deliver the resources necessary to tackle these issues from the ground up, repairing what we can and replacing what we must to make sure that the outages we saw in February never happen again.

39,"Mar 24, 2021",Mississippi Today,Legislative leaders kill key proposal to address Jackson water crisis,"A bill to allow Jackson to raise its citywide sales tax by 1 cent for water and sewer system repairs is dead in the final days of the 2021 legislative session.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, leaving at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — without water for nearly three weeks. City leaders, who have neglected funding the system for decades, say they need major investment from the state and federal government to repair the system, which is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.

The Jackson City Council attempted to take matters into its own hands, passing a proposal in early March to raise the city’s sales tax by 1 cent. That new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — would be used to back large bonds for repairing and replacing the city’s water and sewer system. But state law requires approval from lawmakers before the local sales tax increase could be placed on a citywide ballot. State Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, filed a bill on behalf of the city to acquire legislative sign-off on the 1-cent proposal.

That bill will die without committee consideration, House Local and Private Chairman Manly Barton, R-Moss Point, told Mississippi Today — a blow to the capital city’s main legislative ask as it struggles to afford water system repairs.

Barton said killing the bill is based on precedent — with the 2013 exception of allowing a previous 1-cent sales tax increase for Jackson — of not allowing cities to add on to the state’s sales tax.

“We have been very hesitant to do general sales tax increases for other cities. In fact, we turn them down every year,” Barton said. “We had four or five requests this year. A lot of times the bills don’t even get filed. We work with them on local food-and-beverage, hotel-motel taxes, but there’s just no appetite to do general sales taxes. We’ve been pretty consistent … Of course there was the one for Jackson some years ago — there were conditions set on that and a committee — but we have otherwise been pretty consistent.”

Barton continued: “I think the 1-cent tax would generate about $14 million for Jackson, but it’s a really big hole they’re trying to fill with infrastructure. What I did say is I would do everything I could to help find revenue somewhere else if we possibly can.”

City leaders all along have said the intended purpose of that $14 million a year in new revenue would be to back large bonds, possibly giving the city hundreds of millions they could use in the short-term for infrastructure upgrades.

“This bill, which includes a one percent tax, will support repairing infrastructure after decades of neglect,” Bell told Mississippi Today. “We’ll still need additional support, but this is a first step at a time of urgent need. Sadly, our plan hasn’t been accepted by those in leadership, which further makes our road to recovery difficult.”

Earlier this month in private meetings with both House Speaker Philip Gunn and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba asked for support of Bell’s bill. The 1-cent sales tax increase was the mayor’s main ask of the Republican leaders, along with state bonds that could help the city make emergency repairs on its water distribution system.

Local and private legislation like Bell’s bill traditionally requires support from all or most lawmakers of the locality in question — an unwritten but decades long-standing rule inside the Capitol. In this case, not all of Jackson’s House and Senate delegates were on board with the measure.

After his meeting with Lumumba, Gunn publicly expressed concern about allowing Jackson to raise its sales tax, prompting questions about whether Bell’s bill ever stood a chance of passing out of the House chamber.

“It creates a precedent, if you will, that may be a dangerous area to go to as far as other cities around the state wanting to do the same thing,” Gunn told Scott Simmons at WAPT earlier this month. “And we may get in a situation where the tax burden (on Jackson residents) is just too great.”

Even had the bill passed the House, it faced a difficult road in the Senate. Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, met privately on March 12 with four of the five state senators representing the city of Jackson. None of those senators — Democratic Sens. Sollie Norwood, Hillman Frazier, John Horhn and David Blount — told the lieutenant governor they supported the sales tax increase, according to several of the meeting’s attendees. Sen. Walter Michel, R-Ridgeland, could not attend the meeting but is said to oppose the sales tax increase.

“I am not in favor of (the 1-cent increase),” Horhn told Mississippi Today. “I think it will place too much of a burden on the city’s taxpayers. I believe it inhibits businesses from coming into the city. And it also hurts the efforts to retain and to expand businesses already here.”

Norwood told Mississippi Today he was “open-minded,” but that many of his constituents “have expressed disdain for (the sales tax increase), but I am still not done surveying it.”

Frazier told Mississippi Today he was still studying the possibility of the sales tax increase, “but I have not heard many positive comments about it from the folks in my district. They say it is regressive, and they already are paying an extra 1 cent for infrastructure.”

When asked if he supported the sales tax increase, Blount would not commit. “We are discussing all options, state and federal sources,” he said.

In another indication that the senators opposed the proposal: No one filed a Senate bill similar to Bell’s House bill that would garner legislative approval of the tax increase.

Lawmakers are working to end the current legislative session soon after this coming weekend, and it is unclear what funds, if any, they will appropriate to the city of Jackson. Republican leaders have remained tight-lipped as they are in closed-door meetings this week hammering out the state’s general fund budget.

The closing days of any legislative session are usually when lawmakers pass large packages that send state bonds to local governments. Neither Hosemann nor Gunn have publicly said they wouldn’t support a modest bond package for Jackson, and every lawmaker representing the city of Jackson in both the House and Senate support that effort.

40,"Feb 27, 2021",The Daily Beast,Frustrated Jackson Locals Are Nearing Two Weeks With No Water,"For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

For professional chef Enrika Williams, who lives in south Jackson with four other family members, it was a scramble when news began circulating around Valentine’s Day of an unexpected cold front where temperatures dropped into the teens.

Worried her pipes might freeze, quick-thinking Williams filled up her bathtub in case of such an event. Unfortunately for her and thousands of others, the unseasonably frigid weather caused the city’s outdated water equipment­–which can’t handle wintery conditions–to freeze and water lines to burst.

The result was dire, leading the city to issue a boil-water advisory and set up distribution sites for flushing water and bottled drinking water, with hundreds waiting in line with empty buckets for hours.

Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home. She bought water wherever she could, shelling out $100 on bottled water to cook and clean with.

Nearby family members who happened to have water opened up their home so Williams, her mother, two siblings, and niece could wash their clothes and take a shower.

For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

While Williams finally has water again, albeit trickling, she voiced her dissatisfaction with the city’s everchanging timeframe of when the water would be running again.

“The thing that became frustrating was the tone of accountability just wasn’t there,” Williams told The Daily Beast. “There was no plan that we could see. The press conferences were redundant. If you don’t know when it’s coming back, what is being done to help us?”

“There wasn’t anyone at the forefront who gave a damn, so to speak,” she added. “It makes you feel a lot of things. You just expect better.”

In Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new. Six years ago the city approved a 1 percent sales tax increase with the goal of updating all of its aging infrastructure, but the $15 million it generates annually is only a fraction of the $2 billion Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the city will need. Long before the current crisis hit, one popular local t-shirt read “Welcome to Boil Water Alert, Mississippi.”

What’s different this time, residents say, is the sheer scale—the entire city is either without water or under a boil water alert.

“ It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives. ” — Laurie Bertram Roberts

More than a few residents have noted that the crisis has hit south and west Jackson hardest while leaving northeast Jackson, the one predominantly white corner of this 80 percent Black capital city, relatively unscathed. Over the past several days, Laurie Bertram Roberts, who runs the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, has used the fund to distribute more than 130 cases of water to residents, with plans to deliver another 80 tomorrow.

“Part of the problem is that it’s everywhere,” Roberts said. “Usually when we have an outage it’s in one neighborhood, so people are used to running over to their friends’ house or their auntie’s house to take a shower or fill up some jugs. Usually, you can grab your buckets and find some place to fill them, whatever. But when it’s the whole damn city? Where are the Black people supposed to go? It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives.”

Jackson, which has a population of around 160,000, has a 26.9 percent poverty rate. Williams explained that a lot of people don’t have the resources to go out and buy additional water to cook and bathe with.

“People can’t afford that,” she said. “Water is a basic necessity and it just brought a lot of frustration, anger, and disappointment.”

“We aren’t out of the woods yet. There’s still a lot of people without water.”

While Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday night that he would “restore clean water” and send in the National Guard and tanker trucks with non-potable water in effort to relieve the issue, conditions still hadn’t improved by Saturday.

Fed-up locals flooded the city’s Facebook page to demand answers.

“Day 12 and not even a drip at my house,” Dwight Pugh wrote. “NEVER have we had disrupted this long.”

“It’s clear that the city government doesn’t have the resources or the ability to manage things, and they’re getting worse, rather than better,” John Zer added.

“It’s been two weeks and I know families with infants who don’t have water. The city needs help,” Jamario Townsend chimed in. “I’m thankful my water is trickling out enough to flush my toilet but dang. This just needs to be fixed at this point. It just needs to be fixed.”

Many directed their anger towards Democratic Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who had pleaded with his constituents to have “patience” while admitting there was “no definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.”

“ This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents. ” — Mayor Chokwe Lumumba

Accused of being too slow to reach out to Reeves for assistance, Lumumba claimed the Republican governor wouldn’t return any of his phone calls. Reeves’ camp quickly fired back that the governor had no missed calls from Lumumba.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, “The challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different. This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents.”

“Our systems were never meant to endure days of ice storms and sub-zero temperatures coupled by road conditions that prevented the delivery of critical supplies,” he added. “It has been a difficult few weeks. Our recovery efforts continue. We are not there yet, but we are doing everything we can to restore water to Jackson residents.”

Reeves seems to agree, saying earlier in the week that Jackson’s water systems problems date back to “50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.”

“That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we’re going to fix in the next six to eight hours,” he added.","For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

41,"Feb 24, 2021",WLBT,Communities lend helping hands to those in need during ongoing water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - For some in the Capital City, it’s has been more than a week without running water.

As Jackson’s water crisis continues, the community comes together to make sure residents have their basic needs met.

“I’ve been in Jackson 53 years but I don’t remember having this problem before,” said Dorothy Hopkins after a container of water was filled outside her apartment building Wednesday. The 75-year-old has no running water and lives in Madonna Manor.

She is one of hundreds of Jackson residents receiving water during State Representative De’Keither Stamps’s daily deliveries of bottled and non-drinking water.

“I’m unable to carry water and I can’t lift over 30 pounds and so I just appreciate y’all for bringing this water out here. I really do thank God,” said Hopkins.

Last week Stamps began hauling two 600-pound tanks in his truck and on a trailer, making water deliveries throughout south and west Jackson and Hinds County.

“A lot of these people treat me like their grandson, and I love them to death,” said Stamps. “I can only imagine if it was my grandmother or if it was my aunt, and a lot of folks don’t have people to come take care of them.”

At Wingfield High School, hundreds of cars lined up in the parking lot for assistance. The Wingfield High School Alumni Association and JPS Partner in Education organized a food, bottled water and potable water giveaway.

The items were donated by the Mississippi Food Network, Word of Life Ministries, Walmart, Sam’s, Kroger, Fairview Grocery and Piggly Wiggly, JPS faculty and staff and others.

They were prepared to serve up the 1,300 people in the area.

“This community is without water. Many are without electricity,” said JPD Partners in Education Director Thea Faulker. “So they collaborated with the Wingfield staff and parents and got community partners together. They’re providing support to families while they’re struggling.”

The Mississippi Black Women’s Round Table also donated resources to help the effort.

“Community saves community. Community steps in,” said MS Black Women’s Round Table Executive Director Cassandra Welchlin. “They save each other and so it’s visible here. You can see it happening right now.”

The Wingfield drives continue Thursday and Friday. Stamps will make deliveries until water is restored.

42,"Mar 31, 2021",Politico,How a ‘Radical’ Southern Mayor Ran Up Against Reality,"When it comes to Jackson’s roads, Lumumba has had limited success as well. He has estimated that it would cost $2 billion just to replace the city’s torn-up roads and fix its century-old water pipes and sewers. But Jackson’s tax base has been declining for years. Meanwhile, state lawmakers killed a local 1 percent sales tax to fix Jackson’s infrastructure, even though the city council approved the tax and Lumumba has been lobbying state leaders for it; the Mississippi legislature is required to approve such tax increases in the state. A federal infrastructure bill would help, of course, but Lumumba has no control of that.

“Making sustainable models work in municipal government is the bedrock of the movement,” says Larry Cohen, chairman of the Bernie Sanders-affiliated progressive group Our Revolution, which endorsed Lumumba the first time he ran and continues to support him. “The concern is where do you get investment? … Otherwise it becomes an almost impossible challenge.”

Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Tate Reeves says he and Lumumba have a good working relationship. But Reeves says the state already invests plenty in Jackson, and that it’s up to the city to better manage its finances. “We want to be helpful. We want to do our part,” Reeves said in an interview at the governor’s mansion. He also said the city should fix its water billing issues before raising taxes: “They understand now that they have to get that fixed long before the request of asking other taxpayers throughout the state or other taxpayers throughout the nation to bail out the Jackson water system.”

Many in Jackson’s Democratic leadership have been frustrated not just by Lumumba’s vision, but by his youth, his brashness, his attitude, his confidence (or arrogance, depending whom you ask), his attempts to circumvent them, his casting them aside.

Last year, for example, Democratic presidential hopefuls sought out Lumumba as a key endorsement in the 2020 primary. In February, Lumumba held what he called a “people’s caucus,” where representatives from various campaigns spoke in Jackson, and attendees voted on the candidates. The 100 or so attendees, according to Mississippi Today, overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. Days later, Lumumba endorsed the Vermont senator. While it might have looked like Lumumba was channeling the views of his constituents, the residents of Hinds County, which includes Jackson, ended up voting overwhelming for Joe Biden in the primary. Democratic lawmakers in Jackson and in other Southern cities — like Birmingham's Randall Woodfin, who also was supported by Our Revolution — endorsed Biden, too.

The process showed that Lumumba is out of step with Jackson, says city councilperson and pastor Aaron Banks, who served as the elder Lumumba’s constituent services representative. “When it comes to a far-left approach, I don’t think that’s the best way for the city of Jackson,” says Banks, pointing out that Mississippi is still a very Republican state. “If the city is going to thrive and have success, we have to find that road in the middle.”

Lumumba pushes back, pointing out that the Mississippi primary took place a week after Super Tuesday, by which point Biden’s win was all but certain. He also stands by the process, which he said gave residents a chance to hear candidates’ platforms.

Lumumba has also earned the ire of many local Black contractors, a group of powerful enemies. Marcus Wallace, who is mayor of Edwards, a small town west of Jackson, owns a construction company that has done business with previous mayors. A few years ago, Wallace invested $200,000 in equipment to fix potholes in Jackson, but he told me he hasn’t gotten any business from the current mayor. Driving around downtown Jackson on a Saturday morning, Wallace pointed out potholes and cracked city streets that Lumumba hadn’t gotten around to fixing. He argues that Lumumba has focused on fixing highly visible streets but has neglected those where poor Black residents live.

“This administration does a lot of grandstanding,” Wallace says.

He told me he and other local construction business owners tried to recruit more candidates to jump into the mayor’s race, but few were interested in challenging Lumumba.","When it comes to Jackson’s roads, Lumumba has had limited success as well.

Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker were among the 89 members of the U.S. Senate who voted in favor of a bill that would reauthorize a series of federal water and wastewater infrastructure programs that could benefit the capital city.

On April 29, the Senate approved S.914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021.

The bill was approved on an 89-2 vote and was passed a day before Jackson experienced yet another crisis at its O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

Early Friday, an electrical fire broke out at the Ridgeland facility shutting down two high-service pumps. The fire took place in one control panel, but as a precaution, officials shut down the entire system and issued a boil water notice because of the loss in pressure.

Pressure across the system dropped as a result, and some 43,000 customers were again put under a precautionary boil water notice.

The fire represents the second time operations at the plant have been hampered this year. In February, the plant was crippled when two winter storms ripped across the area, causing equipment at the plant to freeze up. It took weeks for the city to restore water to all residents and businesses following that storm.

S.914 would allocate some $30 billion in funding for clean water and drinking water revolving loan funds and an additional $6 billion for grant programs, according to NBC News.

The bill also would also ease restrictions for cities borrowing money and would allow for more of the debt to be forgiven, according to WaterWorld magazine.

Over the years, Jackson has issued millions in state revolving loan funds to cover water and sewer needs. The loans are made available through the Mississippi State Health Department and Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and come with lower interest rates than commercial bonds.

The measure now must go to the House of Representatives for consideration.

44,"Feb 25, 2021",Christian Science Monitor,Water problems across the South: Blame it on decades-old pipes,"The sunshine is back and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their citizens.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region's water mains, froze equipment, and left millions without service, it’s clear just how much work needs to be done.

Families stood for hours in lines to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

“You don’t realize how much you use water until you don’t have it,” said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described “chronic, long-term and insufficient investment.” The report warned that the “nation’s public health and the economy will be at risk.""

Actually, it's already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents in the city of 650,000 have been told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they plan to use it for drinking, cooking, or brushing their teeth. More than 40,000 Louisianans still had water outages Wednesday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are “non-operational,” affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation's fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already-struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi’s majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson’s water problem a public health crisis.

“The wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,” the retired public works department employee said. “It’s not their concern because they don’t live here no more.”

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

“These pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,” he said. “They’ll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they’ll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.”

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets, and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, while collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

“The vulnerable are left behind,” she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to “old, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.”

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins’ bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants was being done, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city’s 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.

In Jackson, Mississippi, thousands of residents have gone weeks without water. It is a crisis caused by systemic injustices, crumbling water infrastructure, and the climate chaos that brought unprecedented freezing temperatures throughout the South in February.

At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

More than 100 water mains burst in Jackson, leaving residents without water for bathing and cooking. Emergency bottled water was distributed across the city for drinking, and some residents have also gathered and used melted snow and rainwater.

This should not be happening in the United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And while the water woes being experienced by residents of Jackson are more acute than in other places struck by the recent freezing Southern weather, communities throughout the South have experienced widespread water main breaks and failures, largely driven by an aging infrastructure.

Recent years have seen a spate of severe water crises—in Flint, Michigan, rural California, and Martin County, Kentucky, to name a few. Nationally, millions of people lack access to clean, reliable water. Our water infrastructure is crumbling and fiscal austerity is at the core of the problem.

Each year, more than 240,000 water main breaks occur, wasting more than two trillion gallons of drinking water. For decades, federal funding for water infrastructure has been declining. It peaked in 1977, and since then spending has been cut by 77 percent (based on real dollars as of 2017).

This dramatic cut in federal support has increased the burden on state and local communities, which have struggled to keep up. In cities like Jackson that have experienced a declining tax base, the problem has been dire. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba estimated it would cost $2 billion to bring his city’s water system up to date. The city’s total annual budget is only around $300 million.

The inability of cities to replace aging pipes is just one part of our national water crisis. We also have an aging wastewater system, rampant lead contamination, a separate and lurking rural water crisis, and significant water needs in Indigenous communities.

Unsurprisingly, the hardest impacted communities are largely communities of color. Jackson’s population, for example, is more than 80 percent Black. Study after study has found that Black and Indigenous communities disproportionately lack access to safe water in the United States.

This daunting crisis requires a bold federal response. As President Joe Biden and Congressional leaders assemble a much-hyped infrastructure package, they must prioritize funding for our aging water systems.

A blueprint for what this funding should look like is the Water Affordability, Transparency, Equity and Reliability (WATER) Act, recently introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representatives Brenda Lawrence and Ro Khanna in the House.

The WATER Act would provide $35 billion a year to restore and renew our aging water infrastructure, including targeted provisions to help hard-hit areas like low-income communities, rural water systems, and Indigenous communities. It includes grants to schools and homeowners to replace lead pipes and service lines, and it would help make our water systems climate resilient—something for which the current crisis in Jackson has starkly demonstrated the urgent need.

President Joe Biden has said he intends to introduce an infrastructure package in the coming weeks to help the economy recover from the COVID-19-induced recession. Investing in water infrastructure would certainly help do that, and spending proposals laid out in the WATER Act could create nearly one million jobs across the economy. The bill’s requirement that the infrastructure be built with U.S.-made iron and steel, along with prevailing wage requirements, would further help workers and the economy.

At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

Our nation is facing multiple crises—the pandemic, an economic downturn, a climate crisis, and a water crisis. President Biden has an opportunity to lead the nation through all of these. To do so, however, requires real leadership and a comprehensive agenda.

In fighting for significant funding for public water infrastructure, Biden and Congress can help ensure that millions of people in the United States have reliable access to clean public water, while simultaneously revitalizing the economy and building climate resilience for our collective future.","At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

48,"Mar 30, 2021",WJTV,Jackson leaders look for long term fix to prevent another water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Lawmakers slashed the amount of money the City of Jackson asked for to replace the city’s aging water system. But other routes for financial help are still open.

Jackson public works Director Dr. Charles Williams told me he has detailed plans on how to build back and replace the city water plants and its distribution system. He’s confident the funding will become available.

The city asked lawmakers for $47 million to address “immediate needs”. Lawmakers agreed to give $3 million for the project.

“If we were able to utilize $3 million then obviously that would assist us to upgrade the system at the treatment facilities,” Dr. Williams explained. “But also, an opportunity to maybe do an investment within the distribution system itself.”

Jackson state Representatives and Senators are optimistic $6 billion from the American Rescue Plan coming to Mississippi can be broken up to help fund permanent repairs. This on top of $47 million from Mississippi U.S Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.

“We’re hoping that the United State’s Senator will come through and help the City of Jackson,” Councilman Kenneth Stokes of Ward three said Tuesday. “To help us in our water crisis. A sincere effort would be a new water plant.”

For Public Works Director Dr. Williams the priorities will be to get the plants weatherized and install larger distribution lines that will allow water to flow strongly into South Jackson.

“The plant itself needs equipment to properly operate,” Dr. Williams said. “It needs staffing so you need an annual budget that can provide funding in place to keep those mechanical and electrical systems operating.”

In its current status, Dr. Williams emphasized Jackson’s water treatment system is still vulnerable and could crash again if major repairs do not begin by next winter.

Going forward all eyes will be on how Mississippi legislators distribute the American Rescue Plan funds allocated to the state and when, and if, groundbreaking begins on these projects. The price tag for a complete fix of Jackson’s water system is estimated to be over $1 billion.

The city requested $47 million in state money. According to Mississippi Today, only $3 million dollars is being earmarked for Jackson. The funds would go to the city’s oldest water treatment plant.

Lawmakers expect federal dollars from the American Rescue Plan to provide funds for a longer-term water fix in Jackson.","(WJTV) – Lawmakers slashed the amount of money the City of Jackson asked for to replace the city’s aging water system.

Stainless steel pots, a faded-orange wheelbarrow and a 5-gallon container sitting on Barbara Howard’s back porch brim with rainwater. She’s strategically placed them under the roof, letting the light Monday rain gather and then fall into the vessels more effectively.

She grabs a stock pot by its handles and pours it into a nearby trashcan. From there, she’ll scoop out water with a sauce pot to fill her toilet.

A gallon-and-a-half is needed for a single flush. Her Sunday night and Monday collection are enough to last her for the next two days. For Howard, slugging water back and forth from distribution sites is more time-consuming than her newest method.

Inside her South Jackson home, gallons of distilled water and plastic water bottles line her kitchen counters. It’s for teeth-brushing and for handwashing. More for the few dishes she allows herself to use. She doesn’t dare cook, because dirtying dishes means using more water.

“It’s a challenge,” the Jackson State University professor repeats calmly. “But imagine these routines with little bitty ones or the elderly.”

She’s spent nearly two weeks collecting and distributing water. Living without power for four days. Two hotel stays for a cleansing shower. Her faucets ran dry nearly two weeks ago. They still haven’t sputtered back to life. And she isn’t alone.

About 65% of residents in Ward 6 have no water

While water distribution sites lace the city, and restoration has increased since the winter storm glazed Jackson’s infrastructure with ice, South Jackson remains a pocket of residents who are thrusting buckets outside to collect the drizzle. It was only Saturday that some saw a low-pressure stream lurch from their faucets.

About 65% of Ward Six residents have no water, Councilperson Aaron Banks estimated Monday afternoon. It’s not unusual for South Jackson — the location farthest from the treatment plant on the reservoir — to have their water restored last.

He knows it firsthand.

As the steady stream of residents pop their trunks open at Forest Hill High School, Banks loads their cars with a 45-pack of water bottles and a gallon of distilled water. He nods toward the two water tankers in the lot, “When we started out here with these tankers, snow was still on the ground.”

Along with a handful of volunteers, Banks has worked through icy temperatures and pelting rain to help South Jackson residents. Monday is no different. Within 20 minutes, a dozen cars pull up.

“I need to pick up for my elderly neighbor,” several people muffle through face masks.

South Jackson is filled with elderly residents and retirees, many of whom have struggled to make it to the water sites and cannot secure gallons of water in their vehicles as they brace the bumpy roads.

SUBSCRIBERS: 'We're just not built for this down here': Jackson water crisis is latest chapter in decades-long saga

Monday afternoon, Rita Johnson was in the line at Forest Hill. She was picking up water for her family and asked for more to deliver to her elderly neighbors.

Johnson’s a mother of three and a nursing student. And, like Howard, she’s been without water for days.

She uses water bottles from the Forest Hill site to cook, and she bounces between friends’ homes for showering. But the water Johnson said she gets from the distribution site isn’t enough. It’s further complicated her already-busy life, but she’s still finding ways to help vulnerable South Jackson residents.

“If this was your parent, you wouldn’t want them to go out,” she said. “We need to try and help each other.”

Brookleigh Neighborhood Association lends a helping hand

There’s no exact timeline for total restoration. No definite date to lift the citywide water boil advisory. But what is clear is the helping hand from the Brookleigh Homeowner and Neighborhood Association for South Jackson residents.

Emon Thompson has lived in Mississippi for the past 30 years, and he’s been the association’s president for almost four. He’s experienced area flooding and water main breaks that have been slow to fix, but he can’t recall a time there wasn’t water to flush a toilet.

Even now, as some Brookleigh resident’s water trickles from the faucet, it can take toilets minutes to refill.

He and his wife Cynthia Thompson, who coordinates the association's social media, noticed South Jackson’s need for support immediately. The neighborhood, about 450 homes dense, is chock-full of retirees and then there's working-class people, many who work jobs stretching before and beyond the hours water distribution sites offer.

The couple has gone door-to-door providing water and worked a distribution site, alongside Banks, Saturday at Griffith Memorial Baptist Church. They've even scooped water from their swimming pool to deliver.

“It could’ve been worse, but it could’ve been better,” Emon Thompson said.

But it isn’t over.

Although water began flowing into some Brookleigh homes, low-pressure causes comes with a host of problems. People can’t get enough water to wash their clothes, safely cook or do stacks of dishes. Monday, Banks urged businesses that rely on substantial amounts of water, such as car washes, to close their doors until water pressure builds back up to normal.

And same for people with running water. Conserve it, Banks said.

Looking forward, he’s narrowing in on mitigation. South Jackson makes up four wards; 4, 5, 6 and 7, and often times, he said, residents feel left behind.

Jackson water crisis: Crews still working to restore pressure, fix water main breaks

“We kind of feel like we’re the stepchild of Jackson, however, that’s not true but it’s the feeling,” Banks said.

The Thompsons, Banks, Johnson and Howard are wading through uncertainties about when water will fully be restored, but for now, they are sure to do two things: Check on neighbors and deliver water to those most vulnerable.

Help doesn’t have to look as large-scale as the Thompsons fielding resident calls and going door-to-door, or tanker trucks cruising through a neighborhood. It can be systematic, like Howards rainwater collection. Or grabbing an extra case of water bottles for a neighbor, like Johnson.

“I appreciate the tanks. I appreciate the bottled water. But I rather have the pipes fixed,” Howard said. “It’s one thing to put a Band-Aid on the problem and it’s one thing to fix it. A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough.”","'A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough': Many South Jackson residents still have no running waterShow Caption Hide Caption Jackson, Miss., water maintenance crews work to get water mains fixed City of Jackson Water Maintenance Department crews are out in force fixing broken water mains to help get the city's water flowing.

For the past month, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi simply haven’t had water: not safe water, not reliable water. After winter storms knocked out electricity there, as they did throughout the South, the damage also wreaked havoc on Jackson’s brittle water system. Each issue is connected to the other: the aging pipes that need to be replaced, the lead that can seep into the water when the pipes burst, the condition of the water treatment plants. The faucets are back on in Jackson for now, but the pipes aren’t going to hold up much longer. On Tuesday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Nick Judin, a reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, about how Jackson became a city without water, and how it could happen again, all too soon. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Last week, the city’s boil-water order was lifted. Do you feel like the crisis is over?

Nick Judin: The underlying problems behind the crisis have not even begun to be solved. Please don’t look away now, because a permanent solution has to be found, and we haven’t even begun that yet.

The crisis is really a chain reaction that gives us a map of the water infrastructure problems that the city has. In the middle of February comes these two severe freezes, the kind the state is completely unused to. Water comes in from a reservoir northeast of the city that then hits these water screens at the water treatment plants. It’s so cold that it can’t get through the screens that freeze.

It’s ice.

It’s ice. Now, what happens then is the basin that is supplying the city’s pipes with water runs low and the pressure in the system drops. People no longer have water. That’s just the beginning of the problem. That’s why no one had water at the beginning. The problem is, once that system loses pressure and everyone loses water, you have miles of pipes in the system that are over 100 years old. So after they freeze, the act of refilling them is absolutely destructive to these pipes. We had more than 100 water main breaks at the final count over the month.

When you went outside, did you see cones everywhere?

You see breaks in the street. You see water running out. You see work crews everywhere, and you don’t see any water coming out of your faucet. It was this process of slowly refilling, slowly pushing the pressure back up and then repairing every main break. That’s why it took a month.

To get to the root of Jackson’s current crisis, you have to go back more than 50 years and talk about how the city itself has changed. Because this water problem can’t be disentangled from larger changes in the state of Mississippi: the desegregation of schools, white flight.

In 1969, the clock finally runs out on the state of Mississippi segregated school system, with Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education. The 1970 school year in Mississippi was like a lightning bolt. You could just see kids being pulled out of school, and the creation of a lot of segregation academies, many of which are still relatively well-regarded schools in Mississippi today. By the time the dust settles in 1980, Jackson never sees population growth ever again. At its height, I think the city had a little bit more than 200,000 people. Today, the best estimate for that is 160,000.

What does that have to do with the water?

You build a water infrastructure for the people you have at the time. What ends up happening is you build that system and then you have white flight, you have capital flight, you have the suburbanization of many of the metropolitan areas around the country. Then that tax base now lives outside the city limits.

And there’s no commuter tax or bridge and tunnel fare.

To my knowledge, there is not nearly enough support coming from the cities and towns around Jackson to support its burden.

You’re saying Jackson built its system to meet this larger population, which to me says, they must have a really robust system with fewer people using it. How did that become a problem for the city?

In 1972, there was a serious amendment to the Clean Water Act that put the burden of responsibility for a lot of wastewater treatment in the municipalities around the United States on the core of these metropolitan areas. A huge, huge amount of this construction was supported with federal grants. By 1987, in our era of austerity and federal pullback, there’s a transition. We stop paying for a lot of these systems with federal money and it devolves to what’s called the state revolving loan funds. Now, you may notice the problem with that. The issue with the loan is that it’s loan. So when you see an end to the federal money that supports a lot of these systems, there’s then a system that’s made for a certain population and that population is no longer there. That becomes a real problem for any city looking to keep its system afloat.

Because you’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need.

You’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need and you no longer have the federal support that made it possible in the first place.

You’ve said Gov. Tate Reeves has been uniquely resistant to addressing the crisis in Mississippi’s waters. Do you think he doesn’t necessarily feel like he needs to fix this problem?

There doesn’t seem to be any direct communication between the governor and the mayor. I’m not really sure how something like that happens if the governor really, really wants to fix the problem.

You spoke to a representative from Jackson who worried that federal involvement actually might not help the state, because it might mean that state legislators feel like they are off the hook and don’t need to step in and help the city.

Advertisement

Well, let me be very clear: Federal involvement will absolutely help the state. I don’t think there’s any situation in which the state gets out of this problem without federal assistance. I don’t think that should be surprising, because, if you want to go and look back at the last time the city really had a working water system, there was immense federal aid coming in to the Public Works Department to make the entire system whole. So when you want to talk about how to get out of this situation, you need improvement at the level of the city, you need investment at the level of the state, and then you need involvement at the federal level. I don’t think any one of those pieces can be missing. I think his concern is not that federal help might not help, but that, with federal engagement, the state will kind of bow out of the whole situation. The state has to address the relationship it has with its capital city. It’s incredibly cheap and easy for representatives and senators who don’t live in the urban areas of the state to complain about Jackson.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month. On the pandemic front, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to open up vaccine eligibility to all residents over age 16. Twenty percent of adults in Mississippi has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Public health experts are urging residents to keep wearing masks, even though the state’s Republican governor has lifted the statewide mask mandate, and to regularly wash their hands — something that’s been hard to do for the past month in Jackson, the state’s capital, which has gone five weeks without safe drinking water.

The deadly February winter storm that left most of Texas without power for days also devastated other Southern states. In Jackson, the freezing temperatures burst pipes and water mains, leaving most of Jackson without reliable access to running water. While water delivery has largely been restored, “boil water” orders remain in effect for most residents.

The crisis highlights how climate change threatens much of the nation’s aging infrastructure. For Jackson, there are no easy solutions. The city estimates it could cost $2 billion to fix the city’s water system, but Jackson is a poor city in the poorest state in the country. The city is 82% Black, while the state Legislature is majority white. White politicians have openly suggested Jackson’s problems are because of its Black leadership. Mississippi’s Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann criticized Jackson’s handling of the crisis by saying, quote, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?” Kane Ditto was Jackson’s last white mayor.

Donna Ladd of the Jackson Free Press recently wrote, quote, “Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers.”

We go now to Jackson, Mississippi, where we’re joined by Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. He has served as mayor since 2017. His father, Chokwe Lumumba, also briefly served as mayor before dying unexpectedly in 2014 eight months into his first term.

Mayor, it’s great to have you back on Democracy Now! Your city is facing a massive crisis — two. Of course, you’re dealing, like the whole country, with the coronavirus pandemic. And at the same time, you haven’t had clean drinking water for a month. Can you explain what’s happening and what needs to be done?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Yes. First, Amy, thank you for having me again, and thank you for lifting up this issue.

What we suffered after the two winter storms — and I need to make certain that I clarify that, that we had two consecutive storms that took place, leaving us in prolonged low temperatures in the city of Jackson, historically low temperatures in the city of Jackson. And what it did was it created complications getting water into our treatment facility. The raw water screens are at the inception point of the water treatment facility, in which they froze. And because we couldn’t get water in, it complicated or made it impossible for us to clean water and get water out, leaving our distribution system compromised. And as consumption was high, it drained many of the tanks across the city. And our PSI — our water treatment facility operates off of hydraulics. The PSI went down to 37. We need our PSI at about 90 in order to distribute water throughout the system.

This is on account of an aged, aging infrastructure of a legacy city, money which has not been contributed over time, while the city of Jackson contributes millions of dollars each and every year, and has done so since Kane Ditto, before Kane Ditto, and continues to do so. What we have not is had a state leadership that identifies this as not just a city of Jackson problem, but a ongoing and shared problem of not only the city, but the state. And I’d like to just emphasize that in a few ways, if I could, Amy.

One, the city of Jackson is the largest city by a factor of three, the highest contributor to revenue to the state. We are the state capital, which means that many of our properties are untaxable. We do not get payment in lieu of taxes. Furthermore, we provide water to state facilities at no cost to the state of Mississippi. So, if they just paid their water bill, the city of Jackson would be in a lot better position.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mayor, I wanted to ask you — for the brief time that your father was in office, one of the things that he was praised for was attempting to address the infrastructure problem. As I recall, he tried to institute a new tax to provide better infrastructure services. What’s been the problem between the — you mentioned one aspect, the state not paying its water bill — but in terms of being able to implement upgrades of the system?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, I think that you would have to understand the comprehensive infrastructure problem in the city of Jackson. The 1% sales tax generates about $13 million annually. And when I said $2 billion, I didn’t say $2 billion for the water system; I said comprehensively. The way we know that is that the EPA has estimated that our wastewater problem is about a billion dollars, where sewage is coming up in people’s yards and in their backyards and in ditches, and those issues. So, that’s one. That’s before we get to the drinking water, which we see the crisis that we have on our hands after the February storms. That doesn’t get to the drainage. We suffered a 30-year flood just recently, this past — in 2020. So, that doesn’t get to the issue of how drainage is — how people address that. And that doesn’t get to roads and bridges and all of these things, all these parts of our infrastructure that our residents rely on. So, $13 million is just insufficient to meet the need.

The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped. And so, this is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson. Not only are we not met with a consistent plan in order to support the city that supports the state of Mississippi; we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state. But also, we’ve had resources stripped away from us. You referenced the conversation, or you referenced the statements of Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann. As we have lifted up these issues year after year in our legislative agenda, understanding that it’s not a matter of if these infrastructure systems will fail, but when, he redirected the conversation to talk about the state’s effort to take over the city of Jackson’s airport, which is a profitable institution that we rely on year after year.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how difficult has it been for the residents of your city to deal with the water situation while at the same time contending with the issues around the COVID pandemic?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, as you can imagine, our residents have made every endeavor to be as patient as they could. But the frustrations are high. You know, as you can imagine, when people want to drink water, cook with water, not only bathe but get rid of waste, people being concerned about not only the safety precautions of the pandemic but also taking medications, simple things like that, that they anticipate that water will help serve the need to do those things, it has been extremely difficult.

And so, you know, I do want to lift up the many people across the city, individuals, businesses, people from around the country, who have stood in the gap, rallied around the city of Jackson to distribute water. Each one of us have spent countless hours out making certain that we got water to the elderly, to the immobile, to the disabled. And so, while there has been great frustration around these issues, these are issues that the residents of Jackson have dealt with for quite some time, and so they’re very familiar, they’re intimately familiar, with the history of divestment, the history of a lack of investment from the state, very familiar with the woes and troubles of our water infrastructure and our infrastructure in a comprehensive way, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Calandra Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute. She has been delivering bottled water and food to those without water supply.

CALANDRA DAVIS: The communities that was hardest hit by this water crisis are in South and West Jackson, which, again, are the predominantly or majority Black and Brown communities in the city. So, again, it just shows that it wasn’t just another bad weather day for us, that this has been, again, years of neglect to the majority Black and Brown parts of the city, also just another example of how structural racism works.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you explain how people are getting water? I mean, if people can’t afford to buy water, how do they get to places where water is, or have to go to pick it up? One older woman described the only thing she could get was little bottled water. This is to keep themselves clean. It’s not just for drinking.

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, you know, along with the complication of a water treatment facility essentially crashing during the storm, we also had the challenge for several days because roads were iced over and the transportation or distribution system was interrupted on our highways. And so, it became complicated because the local stores didn’t have water anymore. It became complicated because — it was increasingly challenging because trucks could not come and deliver water. But we were able to manage through that and set up distribution sites across the city. The state National Guard did set up tanks around the city for non-potable water, for people to come with containers and utilize. As I mentioned, you had several businesses, several individuals, that stood in the gap in order to support people in that way.

I do want to lift up the issue that Ms. Davis spoke to: the equity issues. You know, it is not a system where you turn on water from one area of town or another area of town. The system distributes water through the lines that were laid, actually, more than a hundred years ago. The problem is an issue of equity. We just have to understand when the take took place. The take happened, or the issues of people who are in poverty or don’t have the resources not being able to get the water, is because they live in areas that were not valued as high or as more desirable by those who had money. Those who had money built homes near — closest to the resources, closer to the water treatment facilities. Therefore, when water is redistributed through the distribution system, through the lines, they are the ones who get water sooner. When you get to South and West Jackson, those are the areas furthest away from the plant. Those are the areas at higher elevations across the city, which means that the water not only has to travel far, but it has to travel high. It has to go up those high elevation points.

And so, you know, we must lift up not only how we build sustainable infrastructure, but how we do it in an equitable way, looking at these issues and looking at how we address those areas through city planning. And city planning is never neutral. City planning is not by mistake. We have to be able to make sure that we do this in a way that creates dignity for all residents across our city.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mayor, on this issue of equitable distribution of resources and services, years ago, your father pioneered the Jackson-Kush Plan, an attempt to empower African Americans in the majority area, geographical areas of the South. How do you assess the progress that’s been made, beginning with his administration, but then going through yours, in terms of spreading this idea of the equitable distribution of resources?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, that is a movement that is ongoing. And we have many successes to point to in that regard. What our goal is, is to democratize power, understanding that issues of infrastructure, that we need to be able to connect, pothole to pothole, in community to community, so people in Jackson, Mississippi, understand why there’s a community that looks just like theirs in Jamaica, Queens, New York, in Gary, Indiana, or Detroit, Michigan. In that process of fixing that pothole, in that process of how we repair our infrastructure in terms of water, what we ultimately learn is that the pothole was never your problem in the first place. Your problem is that you don’t control the decision-making process that leads to the pothole being fixed.

And so, we do that by having people’s assemblies where we engage community. We do that by participatory budgeting, understanding that the budget of the city is a moral document, and if we don’t listen to the community, listen to what the community needs and scratch where they may be itching, then it reflects what our values are as a community. We’ve done that through making sure that we extend a model which is just and transparent as we look at the issues of public safety and policing, not only making sure that we have a police ID task force populated by the community, so that they can work alongside the police department and understand how public safety must look. And so, we’ve done that in a number of ways. We’re are looking at that in terms of economic mobility and economic development in the community, understanding that we want to be a business-friendly city, but we also understand that it has to be a reciprocal relationship. And so, we lift up cooperative business models, as well, so that we can learn how we can fill the gaps.

Even as we have this conversation about water and the issue of water over the last month or so, the reality is that every effort in order to support the infrastructure of the city of Jackson has been undertaken by the residents, by the people, more than the state itself. The decision to tax themselves more in order to help the infrastructure was supported over 90% by the residents. The state isn’t filling in the gap or standing in the gap when people decide to tax themselves more. Those are people taking the issue in their own hands, realizing that we are who we’ve been waiting on. And so, we should be met in that way.

AMY GOODMAN: Mayor, very quickly, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to offer vaccines to everyone above 16. At the same time, the mask mandate has been lifted. The significance of this for your city, for Jackson?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, it’s a contradictory message, and I believe that it is dangerous. While we are happy that we can expand the opportunity for people to be vaccinated, every health professional that I have listened to, all the health professionals we listen to nationally, have indicated that it is just too soon in order to lift the mask mandate.

The city of Jackson, we execute our COVID policy based on science, not politics. And so, we will maintain our mask mandate in the city of Jackson. However, the state’s decision to do otherwise still puts us in a compromised position, because we’re not only the capital city, we’re the capital of healthcare. What that means is, is as surrounding cities may not issue the mask mandate, when their residents, unfortunately, fall victim to the virus, they will overburden our hospitals in the city of Jackson, leaving not only our residents in greater danger, but those individuals who seek hospitalization or seek medical attention for a myriad of other issues, even outside of COVID. And so, I think that it is contradictory. I think that it is confusing. And I think that it is ill-timed.

AMY GOODMAN: Chokwe Antar Lumumba, we thank you so much for being with us, mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, longtime activist.

54,"Apr 7, 2021",BuzzFeed News,"In Jackson, Mississippi, You Can Go Into Debt Trying To Take A Shower","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative. They avoided using the bathroom as much as possible, and when they couldn’t hold it anymore, they stretched black trash bags across the toilet to capture waste and then poured in bleach. They boiled bottled water to cook, and they used baby wipes to clean their bodies. But on day five, Robinson, a single mother, faced the inevitable: She needed to shower to go to work, and that meant overdrafting her bank account by $500 to cover six nights in a hotel outside of town.

In February, freezing temperatures knocked out power and water across the Southeast, leaving millions of people scrambling to stay warm and unable to access basic supplies for days. But in Jackson, most of the city’s 160,000 residents, 82% of whom are Black, were without safe, reliable water for more than a month. It marked the latest chapter in years of issues with a brittle and decaying water system, and highlights the deep vulnerability of aging infrastructure — a problem from Flint, Michigan, to Sandbranch, Texas, and Newark, New Jersey — as extreme weather becomes more routine with climate change.

The recent water crisis has been especially devastating for Black women like Robinson, who is the sole provider for her family. People working in shops and restaurants lost entire paychecks when their workplaces closed due to lack of water. Kids couldn’t go to school or daycare, so parents had to shell out extra money for food and babysitters. They had to divert money away from rent or other bills to buy bottled water and cover the costs associated with being unable to bathe, do laundry, or cook in their own homes.

“It’s everyday life to me. I don’t know how else to describe it because I am so used to surviving that way,” Robinson said. “As far as our Black culture, it’s our culture, what people say is resilience, it’s just us.”

The water is flowing again in Jackson. But for Robinson and others who are barely getting by, the empty taps left debt and new worries about the future. Years of neglect of the water system had already brought poor service and outrageous bills. In the face of a changing climate, the problems can only get worse, and so far, residents have had to pay the price.

Jackson, the capital of the poorest, Blackest state in the nation, has been flailing for a long time. Decades of white flight and mismanagement, coupled with broken, antiquated infrastructure, have hampered its growth and thus its ability to revitalize itself. City leaders have estimated it would cost around $2 billion, though they recently asked the state for $47 million, to fix its water systems, which, due to a meager pool of public funds, it just can’t do. And the state has historically refused to step in and help, with Gov. Tate Reeves last month calling on the city to collect overdue bills from locals before seeking state support. The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. City officials, and experts who advise them, have argued that the water system’s ratepayers simply cannot shoulder those massive costs.

“What is on the line is really overwhelming,” Dominika Parry, a climate economist who lives in Jackson and founded 2CMississippi, a nonprofit climate change action group, explained to BuzzFeed News. “It’s a failure of lack of support from the state. And when you have a concentration of Black families who are low-income…and a state that refuses to acknowledge climate change, it’s not a sustainable situation, and we are seeing the consequences.”

It’s people like Robinson who have to “take it,” the climate economist said. This time, that meant a hefty hotel bill and overdraft fees. The next disaster could be worse, she added.

“When we have floods, hurricanes, and heat, those who can’t afford to leave die.”

Robinson has lived in Jackson for 22 years, and she and thousands of other residents have grown used to their pipes bursting or sputtering out dark liquid, as well as random shutoffs, while still getting hit with high and inconsistent bills. They’ve grown accustomed to having to boil their water, knowing that the lead in their corroded systems might still poison them, and watching sewage bubble up in their backyards.

Officials have for years warned pregnant residents and children under 5 not to drink the tap water. The city sends boil water notices about five times a year and shuts taps off entirely when a water main busts. On top of that, residents have to bear the brunt of a broken billing system that became even more of a debacle after former mayor Harvey Johnson signed a contract with Siemens Inc. and several subcontractors in 2012 who, according to a lawsuit later filed by the city, manipulated the rules to jack up prices and further gouge Jackson for water.

City officials reached a $89.8 million settlement last March, but residents are still dealing with sporadic and spiked bills. After not getting a bill for about a year, Ronnie Crudup Jr., a state representative who was born and raised in Jackson, went to the department in person to see what was going on and found that he owed $2,500 for water, he told BuzzFeed News.

“Water bills are all over the place. $1,500 up to $10,000. We don’t fully know the true costs,” he said. “People are suing the city because they don’t believe their water bills are accurate. People are not getting bills and people can’t pay the percentage of the bill they need to. As a result, we’re not collecting.”

Then came February’s storms, a new crisis that no one had expected would leave the city waterless for so long, nor the financial ramifications it would continue to have for residents who were already struggling.

Robinson makes $16,800 a year as a teacher’s assistant for students with special needs in the Lincoln County School District, about $21,000 less than the state’s median income. It’s her purpose, she said, to nurture the students “so many people sweep under the rug,” but that small paycheck makes supporting her own kids a constant, stressful calculation.

If she “budgets right,” Robinson can manage to feed her family of three for just $100 a week and then sets aside $180 for electricity, $80 for gas, and $1,000 for rent each month. And for all the years she’s lived in Jackson, water has always been an issue, so she’s factored that in. Despite having a filtration system and setting aside about $120 to pay a chunk of her bill, she still spends about $40 to $50 on bottled water monthly.","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative.
But in Jackson, most of the city’s 160,000 residents, 82% of whom are Black, were without safe, reliable water for more than a month.
“Water bills are all over the place.
People are not getting bills and people can’t pay the percentage of the bill they need to.
And for all the years she’s lived in Jackson, water has always been an issue, so she’s factored that in."

A viral video about the city of Jackson is getting a lot of attention. The video was posted by a business visitor who said he loved the people in Jackson, but not those running the city. ""Political leaders for the city of Jackson, Mississippi... Where the h--- are you,"" said Joshua Desha, a Jackson visitor.Desha posted a 12-minute video rant on YouTube and praised the people of the city for their kindness and warmth. Desha then bashed the city's elected officials for doing very little to deal with boarded-up businesses and broken streets.""This is beyond a shadow of a doubt the poorest run city I have ever been in,"" Desha said.Desha's video is getting a lot of attention across the capital city.

56,"Mar 11, 2021",Bustle,How To Help Those Affected By The Water Crisis In Mississippi,"A few weeks ago, the dangerous winter weather conditions that hit the southern U.S. made headlines across the country, with much of the attention placed on Texas. But those in neighboring areas were just as impacted by the extreme winter storm. Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst. Weeks later and many residents are still without any drinking or flushing water.

The city — and roughly 5,000 of its residents, the majority of which are low-income Black families — is experiencing a water crisis. Cassandra Welchlin, the state organizer for the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, a network that pushes for equitable public policy for Black women and girls, tells Bustle that many people in Jackson are unable to afford food because they can’t get to work. Others are forced to stay home from their jobs because they can’t perform simple everyday tasks like taking a shower or brushing their teeth.

Weeks after the winter storm, Jackson, Mississippi is experiencing a water crisis.

She puts the blame on the state’s weak infrastructure. “This has been a long-standing problem,” says Welchlin. Politicians don’t always put resources where they need to be, she explains, which is why organizations like hers join together to provide support for the community. Through donations, the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable has organized water drives, provided gift cards for hotel stays and groceries, and provided outreach to find water to use from neighboring towns. “We’ve worked with a legislature from the Mississippi Gulf Coast to get truckloads of water brought into the city,” Welchlin says. She was then able to partner with local schools and community leaders to distribute the water to those in need.

Welchlin is now mobilizing community members to help those hardest hit groups like the elderly and single moms, and is urging residents who have cars to take water to the homes of the elderly so they can simply flush their toilets. She’s also been collecting donations like diapers and baby food to help single mothers who abruptly lost work and didn’t qualify for paid leave.

More than anything, Welchlin says residents and the organizations helping to restore these families are still in need of donations because people are still without water and struggling to get essential household and personal items. If you’re looking to help, you can donate to these local organizations that support families across Mississippi:","Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst.

57,"Mar 24, 2021",Mississippi Today,‘A profound betrayal of trust’: Why Jackson’s water system is broken,"Janna Avalon, a 72-year-old retired newspaper editor, lived out the mid-February ice storm and weeks-long water outage just feet from South Jackson’s empty water tower.

The one million-gallon tank, one of several across the city, is meant to store water at a high elevation, utilizing gravity to pressurize the delivery system, especially during service interruptions.

But contingency plans are a myth in a system as chronically broken as Jackson’s.

So for the better part of the last month, Avalon and her husband Billy heaved buckets of water they retrieved from government tankers, kind neighbors or rainfall into their home to flush their toilet or wash dishes.

Most Jacksonians lost running water altogether after back-to-back winter storms the week of Feb. 14 stunned unprepared utilities across the Deep South, and the Avalons were some of the roughly 43,000 people whose taps remained dry for more than two weeks. City officials were still telling most residents, 82% of whom are Black, to boil their water a month later.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government … when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered, it’s a profound betrayal of trust.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

In the Avalons’ spacious backyard — beyond a wooden playset, garden and plum trees, plastic flamingos and decorative stone statues — the water tower adds its own charm. Avalon said it reflects colors in the evening sky, prolonging sunsets.

“It’s got all these great little attributes,” Avalon said, “except water.”

Avalon grew up in Jackson and has lived in her home, where she raised her five children, for 28 years. Despite ongoing utility hiccups, she’s intent on staying. She asks why she should have to move — and contribute to the city’s population decline of 20% since 1980 — to access basic human services. Why city and state government officials can’t or won’t improve conditions where she already lives. Why her water bills are unreliable, why nobody reads her water meter, and why there is a “huge city water tower in our backyard and there’s no water in it.”

The questions seem simple, but the answers are complex, and the dysfunction is causing a rift between Jacksonians and their leaders.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government,” said Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. “It comes into your house. You take it into your body. We put our children in it, and we prepare food with it. And when that fails — when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered — it’s a profound betrayal of trust. And it shakes you to your core.”

Many Jacksonians lacked access to clean drinking water long before the most recent storm. In fact, on a good day, officials advise pregnant people and children under five not to drink from the tap, a phenomenon that’s been the case for the last five years.

“And most people in Jackson don’t even know,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, told Mississippi Today during the recent outage. “The city and the state have done nothing to provide water to those populations. This whole time they should have been providing water for pregnant people and children under five. This whole time.”

And yet, when Jackson water customers do receive a bill (because consistent and accurate billing has also been a problem), they’re sometimes paying exorbitant amounts for water that’s unsafe to drink.

Every city water bill notifies customers of the hazard of high lead levels first found in Jackson’s tap water in 2016, caused by recurring faulty water treatment techniques that remain unaddressed.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city’s water system presented “imminent and substantial endangerment” to its customers and could contain E. Coli.

Water outages and the presence of harmful contaminants when the water does reach the tap are two different scenarios with unique sets of threats, but they both stem from decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance within a dysfunctional and outdated water treatment and delivery system.

And the risks of scarce or dirty water exist more often in the homes of families who are already burdened by the ongoing pandemic, low wages, stagnant wealth, a lack of quality health care and racism.

The city is faced with two colliding but distinct funding problems: One, the city’s infrastructure is only getting older and past administrations did not plan for inevitable future capital investments, as is true in many aging cities. Two, the loss of customer base and pervasive billing troubles have left the water department without a feasible revenue model for regular operations and maintenance.

“This is like a triple or quadruple whammy, what’s going on,” said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at D.C.-based Center for Community Progress. “One layer is the fact that older cities — completely leaving aside race, poverty, all that — are at a disadvantage to young cities.”

“Then you get the second layer,” Mallach continued. “You have this whole phenomenon which has been going on really since the 1950s, where older cities, central cities, have essentially been abandoned by large parts of the middle class, especially the white middle class, for the suburbs.”

Winter storms in past years — 1989, 1994, 2010, 2014 and most recently 2018 — have tested the city’s outdated water delivery system and caused widespread water main breaks and outages. Each time, the city has scrambled to make band-aid repairs, only to wait until the next catastrophe. Jackson isn’t alone in taking this approach, said Teodoro, the Wisconsin professor.

“The nature of local politics is that city governments will tend to neglect utilities until they break because they’re literally buried,” he said. “One of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe. But the price is very easy for them to observe.”

Not even EPA orders — including a decade-old consent decree over the city’s wastewater system that continues to release raw sewage into the Pearl River — have resulted in much meaningful action. City water and sewer systems are not like corporations, Teodoro said; the authorities can’t just take their license away. And imposing large fines only punishes the taxpayers they are supposed to be protecting. “In the end, there’s very little you can do,” Teodoro said of regulators.

“They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund

This year, Jackson officials said, issues were particularly pronounced at the water treatment plants, which are not enclosed and protected from the elements like plants typically are up north.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams told the media that the screens through which water from the reservoir is filtered had frozen, rendering the plant incapable of taking in water, causing pressure to drop across the system. Operators didn’t discover the issue until the weekend after the storms. They also encountered malfunctioning raw water pumps.

Also, the 10 million gallon basins where filtered reservoir water is stored before it is chemically treated contained two feet of sludge due to an overdose in chemicals that occured over time when water wasn’t coming in — a possible human error, Williams said. The city took two basins offline to clean them the week after the storm and cleaned the third a couple weeks later.

In addition to needed equipment upgrades, the city is sorely lacking the personnel needed to operate the plant in its current condition. City officials rely on these operators to notify them of an event, such as sludge build up, that they need to address. Jackson employs three high-level operators at each of its water treatment plants, when each facility really needs six of these top officials, Williams told Mississippi Today. In 2018, there were 60 unfilled positions in Public Works, Clarion Ledger reported.

“You have to maintain what you have until you’re able to make improvements,” Williams said. “But once again, you have to have funding.”

Two generations of white and wealth flight out of Jackson has reduced the built-in revenue that officials say the water system needs just to maintain full operations, including hiring personnel — let alone to make a dent in an estimated $1 billion worth of needed upgrades.

The city’s bungled attempt to revamp its water meter and billing system through a $90 million contract with German-based manufacturer Siemens only worsened the water department’s cash flow — not to mention public confidence — while any outside investment in the capital city has come at a crawl.

“And we all know why,” Roberts, the activist, said. “Nobody wants to invest in Jackson because of who runs Jackson and who lives in Jackson. Because white folks don’t dominate here anymore. They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.”

With a population that’s 82% African American, Jackson is the single Blackest large city in the nation. Roughly 1-in-4 residents live in poverty, and in some west and south Jackson communities, the hardest hit by water outages, the average household pulls an income of $25,000 and as low as $15,000 in some pockets.

The capital city has lost roughly 40,000 residents since the population peaked at about 200,000 in 1980, after an initial wave of white residents left to avoid putting their children in integrated schools. Half of the decline occurred in the last two decades as more middle-class Black families moved, and the city’s white population continued to drop from 52% in 1980 to 28% in 2000 to 17% in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

As the customer base declines, the system might clean and pump out less water, but the same infrastructure remains under the surface of Jackson’s 111 square miles, an area geographically larger than Seattle, Baltimore or Cincinnati. Parts of Jackson’s 1,500 miles of water mains are over 100 years old.

Of course, pipes under streets in front of abandoned properties — about 4,000 by one 2019 count — still require maintenance.

At the same time, family resources are diminishing with inflation. Household buying power fell just slightly in the 1980s and was relatively stable through the 1990s. But since 2000, the annual median household income in Jackson has dropped about $6,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars, a roughly 15% decrease, according to a Mississippi Today analysis of Census data.

“We are a city with very high levels of poverty, and it’s difficult for us to raise the rates enough to do large scale replacement type projects and not make it unaffordable to live in the city of Jackson,” said former city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

Yet the cost of Jackson’s poor quality water is still passed on to families who don’t trust the tap and purchase bottled water — which can cost a family of four $50-$100 a month — to drink instead.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

The city raised water rates in 2013, but the Siemens deal penned the same year came with an onslaught of problems, including the installation of faulty water meters and meters that measured water in gallons instead of the correct cubic feet. This made any benefits of the rate increase virtually impossible to see.

The results have been nonsensical. Over the past several years, the city has mailed exorbitant bills to some customers and none to others. Sometimes, the charges weren’t based on how much water a household used and other times, city officials advised residents to “pay what they think they owe.” Past officials said the city lacked the manpower and expertise in the billing department to manually rectify the account issues with any speed.

In trying to protect people during the persistent billing blunders, the city has at times instituted no-shutoff policies, which demonstrate compassion but haven’t helped to compel payment.

Today, more than 8,000 customers, or nearly one-sixth of the city’s customer base, still aren’t receiving bills. Nearly 16,000 customers owe more than $100 or are more than 90 days past due, a city spokesperson told Mississippi Today. Jackson water customers owe a total of $90.3 million.

As a result, the city continues to miss out on tens of millions of water revenues. In 2016, when officials first uncovered the issue, the city’s actual water sewer collections during the previous year was a startling 32% less than projected — a roughly $26 million shortfall.

It’s a vicious cycle: revenue shortfalls make it harder for the city to purchase upgrades or hire the personnel needed to properly manage the billing system; the billing inaccuracies and sloppy accounting encourage a culture of nonpayment; the unpaid bills just further tank the revenue.

Frustration only grows as residents are expected to pay for subpar service within a utility that’s already largely taken for granted.

The city received just under $60 million out of last year’s $90 million Siemens settlement, about $33 million of which is restricted in reserves or bond covenants. Another $12.6 million went to repay the general fund, leaving about $14 million for emergency sewer repairs and a new billing system.

Lawyers got the rest — a little more than $30 million.

The story of Jackson’s failing infrastructure, national experts say, could just as easily describe the scenario in other major cities like Detroit, Toledo or Kansas City, whose leaders have had to look outside their own budgets to solve major crises.

A city rests within a state, after all, and decisions made at the state level and the impact those decisions have on the economy and public services affect what a city is able to accomplish.

“It’s really disingenuous to look at the politics and policies of any one American city in isolation from the state context in which it exists,” Teodoro said.

The residents who left Jackson in the late 20th century fled to surrounding suburbs such as Rankin County, the wealthier Republican bastion that produced many of Mississippi’s most powerful politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves.

Less than a year ago, Reeves vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided relief to poor Jacksonians with past due water bills and propped up the city’s bond rating, a proposal he suggested perpetuated a “‘free money’ concept,” Clarion Ledger reported.

A similar bill, which would apply to all municipalities, is making its way through the Legislature this session. Lawmakers also killed a bill to assist Jackson with infrastructure bonds, but it still has a chance to pass legislation that would allow the city to propose its own sales tax increase to pay for water system improvements.

Meanwhile, Speaker Philip Gunn, another top lawmaker who lives in a Jackson suburb, spent the session trying to pass tax reform that would have actually increased the tax burden on the bottom 60% of the state’s income earners, according to one study, while significantly cutting the taxes of the richest residents.

The city is also still fighting the state’s 2016 attempt to wrest control of Jackson’s airport. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during a recent mayoral debate that during a conversation with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the state Senate leader who lives in the white pocket of northeast Jackson, the lieutenant governor asked the mayor to “give me my airport” in exchange for infrastructure funding.

This ongoing tension is the backdrop for the city’s current crisis.

Academics who have studied government water systems recommend they regionalize in order to spread costs among struggling cities and more affluent suburbs. There’s just one recurring hitch to securing such an agreement: “Racism makes all of this so much harder,” Teodoro said.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.”

The history of racial conflict, Teodoro explained, creates a scenario where Black residents of the city fear losing control of their services to the same people who have systematically oppressed them. And white residents of the suburbs, who chalk the city’s problems up to incompetence, don’t feel responsible to help.

In the Jackson metro, not only is regionalization a tough sell, there are examples of the opposite happening. West Rankin Utility Authority recently splintered off to build its own wastewater treatment facility to become independent from Jackson’s Savannah Street Wastewater Treatment Plant.

It’s twofold: Systemic racism is an unmistakable underlying cause for Jackson’s stripped resources, and while it may be clouded by a mutual distrust today, racism continues to prevent future investment.

For Avalon, a white woman, understanding the decline of her majority-Black community is as easy as pointing to the state’s refusal to fully fund education or expand Medicaid.

“Racism is everywhere,” Avalon said. “We need to recognize what we’re talking about. If my kid goes to public school that’s not up to par, why? We’re all paying taxes.”

The storage tank on Avalon’s street wasn’t full of water, Williams explained, because as the system loses pressure on an ongoing basis, not just during storms, the tower is constantly drained to make up for the deficiencies. He said he didn’t know if that tank had ever been full.

South Jackson often bears the brunt of water crises because the area is one of the furthest away from the treatment plant, so water takes longer to travel there. What little water would have been inside the tower at the time of the storm was used up immediately by some of the roughly 70,000 people who live in South Jackson.

That’s a convenient explanation for Avalon, who says her community is always last to receive attention on a variety of issues. “We’ve been putting up with that stuff all my life in south Jackson,” she said.

Jackson City Councilman De’Keither Stamps pushed the council to ask the state for $60 million, in addition to an initial $47 million proposal, to build new water storage towers in South Jackson and Byram to build up capacity in those areas.

“You shouldn’t have to live your life in fear of the plant going down,” Stamps said. “You should have enough capacity within a short distance from your house to maintain yourself.”

On March 1, just as water was starting to trickle out of her tap, Avalon stood on her back porch as it rained and looked out at the empty water reservoir that engulfs the skyline. City contractors had just come out a few years ago to repaint its dingy exterior, she recalled. Some 100 feet up, a large black fowl crouched on top of the massive steel structure stamped with the City of Jackson seal.

“If they’re vultures, gosh, that’s a terrible omen,” she said with a chuckle.

Water pressure in the Avalon home fell again in the following days as city officials discovered the facility’s intake filters were clogged with clams, mussels, tree branches and other items and had to take the systems offline. The Avalons had to shut off their water again the following weekend because of a broken pipe on their property. They’ll expect outages to continue.

“It keeps coming back and slapping us in the face, and we can’t do anything about it,” Avalon said.

While the Mississippi city of Jackson works to fully restore water, various community organizations have been filling in the gaps with relief. Mutual aid is a new term for some, but providing it is an old practice in many Black communities.

“As a southern Black girl, who grew up in rural Mississippi, mutual aid has always existed in my life,” Calandra Davis, an organizer with the Jackson chapter of Black Youth Project 100 (BYP 100), told NewsOne. Davis said community institutions have always provided aid in times of need. “The churches [and families] in my community always provided mutual aid,” she added.

Providing support to communities in Jackson and across the state, the Mississippi Rapid Response & Relief Coalition is a statewide coalition, including rural partners. Member organizations include the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, the People’s Advocacy Institute, the Milestone Cooperative, Mississippi M.O.V.E., Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition, BYP 100 and Sarah’s Touch.

Davis said the organizations took on various roles in the storm’s aftermath, each finding its own lane.

“Some people were preparing and delivering food,” Davis explained. “Others were helping to find water and get it out to people.”

She said BYP 100 helped get money into the hands and pockets of people who lost income.

“We also secured hotels for folks who were without power and water,” Davis shared.

Members of the coalition were engaged in community outreach work even before the current water crisis.

“We take a holistic approach,” Sharon Brown, founder and executive director of the Council of Sisterhood, a philanthropic organization, said. “[Our] work didn’t shift, it became harder because we couldn’t get the supplies that we needed to provide for the people in the community.”

Brown said she founded the Council of Sisterhood in 2013 with her sister Valerie Brown.

“We started the organization because we saw the needs of our community not being met because of systemic racism,” Brown explained. She said that her organization has provided everything from clothing to food and even money to help pay utility bills.

“The village is only as strong as the members,” said Brown. “And so if you have one family hurting, then the whole community hurts and suffers.”

The current crisis comes as communities continue to deal with COVID-19. Mississippi is one of two states that recently lifted pandemic restrictions put in place to protect public health and safety.

The disregard for Black lives has been clear even before the pandemic, but existing through the layered crisis has been a real eye-opener for some people.

“We’re really just seeing environmental issues and racism paired together,” Davis said. “And [there are] no real systemic solutions are being offered.”

Rukia Lumumba agreed with Davis and framed the current crisis as a part of a larger challenge.

“Over the last few years, we’ve just been seeing the weather changes become more significant,” Lumumba said in an interview with NewsOne. “And it has consistently harmed our communities, more so than any other community.”

Lumumba is the founder and executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, an organization she envisioned alongside her father, the late Mayor Chokwe Lumumba. She is also the older sister of Jackson’s current mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. At its core, the People’s Advocacy Institute is a community capacity-building and training organization. Lumumba and her team, along with partner organizations, work to uplift impacted communities.

While the city has set up local distribution sites, Lumumba sees the grassroots relief effort as people stepping up to do what needs to be done. She said once the roads were safe, some people drove as long as two hours to find water.

As a part of the Rapid Response and Relief Coalition, Lumumba and the People’s Advocacy Institute fielded requests for food or hotel assistance, water distribution and even money.

“We’ve seen a decline in people asking for hotels,” Lumumba explained. “But now we’ve seen an increase in people asking for financial assistance to cover everything that they lost.”

From pipe repairs and fixing other related damage to buying groceries, people have incurred additional expenses because of the winter weather and water outage.

She said the groups have provided support in Jackson and the greater Hind County area as well as several rural communities from the Mississippi Delta to communities in central and northern Mississippi.

“The collective effort is critical to our sustainability,” said Lumumba. “Our livelihood [and] our ability to survive is intertwined with our ability to work together.”

Lumumba recounted the first week of the winter storm that left highways closed and services disrupted all over.

“Prior to this, anytime there were any major weather changes, our water system was in jeopardy of shutting down in certain areas of town,” explained Lumumba.

She said this impacted South and West Jackson more than any other areas, noting these are predominantly Black and poor areas of the city.

When asked about the state response, Lumumba described the governor’s attitude and approach as a part of a long-held disregard the state’s white elected officials have for both the city’s Black leadership and residents. At one point late last month, the governor made a comment about the state taking over Jackson’s water system.

“What really needs to be done is major infrastructure investment on the federal and state level,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder and Executive Director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, said last week on MSNBC show “The Reid Out.” She challenged claims that the governor could not reach Mayor Lumumba, as Jackson is the Mississippi state capitol placing the governor in close proximity to city government officials handling a crisis.

“But that’s how little the priority is,” Roberts continued. “And it’s not just Jackson, the Mississippi Delta is without water right now.”

Looking forward, Lumumba said the coalition is thinking about how to operationalize how they do rapid response.

“What we’re trying to do now is think about how we create these rapid response hubs,” she shared. “We know that there are going to be more and more storms and changing weather conditions that shift how we’re currently living. There is no guarantee that we are not going to be able to live the way [we do].”

Brown said climate change is real and needs to be a factor considered in whatever next steps are taken.

“And this will not be the first crisis, but one of many crises,” she said. “Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the nation, but at the end of the day, it’s a group of folks that really love and care genuinely about what happens with our community…we represent, and we stand in love.”

Davis compared the current moment to other times of awakening that brought people into organizing. She said some people had “an aha moment” after the killing of Trayvon Martin or last summer with the killing of George Floyd.

“For some folks in rural Mississippi and Jackson it is going to be the ice storm and water crisis,” said Davis. “I believe [this crisis] will cause people to collectively come together [and] use their power to make some structural changes to what has been happening in the city for decades now.”

60,"Mar 5, 2021",Voice of America,"Weeks After Winter Storms, Mississippi City Still Grappling With Water Crisis","JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI - Officials in Mississippi's largest city, Jackson, are aiming to have running water largely restored by the weekend, nearly three weeks after devastating winter weather left tens of thousands of residents without service.

The city was again distributing non-potable water Friday at four sites so people can flush their toilets, and residents must still boil any faucet water before using it for food preparation, drinking, washing dishes or brushing teeth.

Charles Williams, the city's public works director, said Thursday that workers should soon be able to sample enough water to lift the boil advisory.

""I see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Williams said at a news conference, sounding more optimistic than he did Wednesday, when problems at the city's treatment plant caused pressure to drop across the entire system. At that time, he estimated that about a quarter of Jackson's 43,000 water connections — most of which serve multiple households — were not operating.

Ben Mitchell and Deon Sanders work at a public water distribution site after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, in Jackson, Mississippi, March 4, 2021.

Officials did not have an updated estimate as of Friday, though city spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the system was able maintain pressure overnight.

Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water to perform the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.

She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. Her husband's uncle, however, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.

""It was very stressful,"" said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ""third-world country.""

The problems stem from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down the state's power grid and leaving millions without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.

Jackson, the state capital with a population of more than 160,000 people, has seen more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said.

The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves earlier this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson's water system.

Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children finally had water service return Thursday after more than two weeks without it. ""I was like, 'Oh Lord,'"" she said with relief.

Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.

The crisis has also shuttered businesses across the city.

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie's New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint, would open Friday for the first time since February 17 after getting water restored Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Bakery & Cafe, meanwhile, were spending all day on Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening Saturday morning.

62,"Mar 25, 2021",Mississippi Today,"Policy experts explore Jackson water solutions, highlight void in federal aid","The fragility of Jackson’s water system, plagued by decades of outmigration, deferred maintenance and declining federal support, was on full national display in February after a historic freeze left at least 40,000 without running water for weeks.

City officials are asking for state and federal support to help raise the $1 billion they say is needed to fix the system, which failed to produce safe drinking water for more than a month after the storm.

Mississippi Today spoke with several national policy experts about how other American cities have navigated large-scale water funding shortages and how Jackson could move forward. The experts offered several solutions, chronicled in the article below, but ultimately agreed that the absence of a more involved federal government leaves few answers for Jackson.

“A lot of these systems that are on the brink of falling apart, they’re just one extreme event away from a crisis,” said Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University. “That’s what happened in Jackson. It’s a cumulative effect of not investing in our infrastructure for so many years. Aging infrastructure, all of these extreme events that we’re experiencing, it’s all coming together.”

Some signs of short-term relief have trickled in during the past couple weeks. Jackson is set to receive $47 million from the American Rescue Plan, the name of the new $1.9 trillion stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed last week. Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced a bill in Congress that would steer infrastructure funds towards the city.

But those measures still leave Jackson a long way from the necessary funding to repair and revamp its water system.

Federal water infrastructure support has plummeted since the 1970s, when the U.S. sent funds to cities to help comply with the newly-passed Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts. In 1977, federal support accounted for 31% of governments’ total water utility spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By 2017, that share had dropped to 4%.

Now, such spending largely comes in the form of loans rather than grants, mainly through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act that supports specific projects, as well as an annual allotment called the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which last year totaled $2.7 billion for the whole country.

“If Jackson alone has a $1 billion need, and the total EPA State Revolving Fund is $2.7 billion, that starts to give you an order of magnitude of how big the problem is versus how much money is actually available,” said Dr. Martin Doyle, Director for Water Policy at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University.

As for many cities with rupturing infrastructure, the decline in federal support has coincided with Jackson’s sharp decline in population, which has shrunk by 20% since 1980.

Ajami, Doyle, and others discussed with Mississippi Today the ways other cities have tried to boost water infrastructure funding, such as consolidation and privatization, as well as different approaches to water billing.

Consolidation of regional water systems

For many cities, capital improvements such as upgrades to treatment plants and large-scale pipe replacements are simply unaffordable for their tax bases. Those cities instead focus what money is available towards regular operations and maintenance. But as bigger projects get pushed back, their costs only grow.

Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University

“The cost of recovering from the crisis is much higher than the cost of prevention,” Ajami said.

One successful cost-saving solution is consolidating utilities with neighboring towns and cities, similar to the way school districts merge to save money.

In 2014, after the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy, a court ordered the creation of a regional authority that assumed the city’s water and sewer services. The Great Lake Water Authority took on $4 billion in debt from the city, and Detroit officials said the change allowed it to make infrastructure upgrades it couldn’t otherwise afford. Similarly, Raleigh, N.C., saw a decrease in maintenance and operation costs after combining utilities with nearby municipalities in the early 2000s.

“That starts to increase the scale of the operation, which means that you’re able to gain some efficiencies,” Doyle said.

In the U.S., there are more than 50,000 water utilities that operate independently, meaning they each have their own management and set of personnel, from engineers to customer service. When places combine utilities, they’re often able to serve the same populations at a lower fixed cost.

Despite the cost-saving potential, some city officials are unsure if Jackson and its neighbors could come to such an agreement, especially considering political and racial differences.

“I think it would be a difficult political thing to put a regional water system together, just because there’s a lack of trust issue,” said Jackson city councilman Ashby Foote. “A lot of the surrounding communities, I don’t think they would let Jackson run it, and I don’t think the city would vote to relinquish control of the systems.”

Foote and Jackson councilman De’Keither Stamps cited disagreements such as control over Jackson’s airport and the recent decision by West Rankin County officials to break off and build its own wastewater facility.

“Now (West Rankin) has to spend all this money to build a new sewer plant because of relationships and politics,” Stamps said. “How does that benefit the end user?”

Privatization of Jackson’s water system

While not as popular, privatization is a similar solution to consolidation, explained Doyle, who explored water-funding solutions for shrinking cities in an article for the American Water Works Association journal. Private water utilities, which serve 15% of Americans, can combine functions just as a regional utility would and can also provide more resources and expertise. Research also shows they are less likely to violate the EPA’s health-related drinking water statutes than public utilities.

The main concern around private utilities is cost. If a company took over Jackson’s water system, it would have to justify any rate increases with the state’s Public Service Commission; however, Doyle’s paper cites that “it is not uncommon for water rates to increase by greater than 10% when public systems are privatized, and in some cases, rates have reportedly almost doubled.”

Doyle said while it’s unclear how much more a private utility would cost Jackson, it should be considered a “tool in the toolkit.” Ajami and others were more skeptical.

“I don’t think privatization is going to solve the water problem for Jackson,” Ajami argued. “It’s probably going to make water more unaffordable. Their system will be upgraded, I’m just not sure that will lead to more affordable water rates for Jackson.”

Former Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. said he turned down the idea while in office.

“That idea was thrown out, I rejected it,” said Johnson, who was mayor from 1997 to 2005 and again from 2009 and 2013. He asserted that private companies don’t have the same accountability as elected officials, and that cities can get locked into long-term contracts without a way out. “The driving force there is the bottom line, it’s not service.”

Jackson City Council President Aaron Banks said that whether it’s consolidation or privatization, Jackson leadership needs to be open-minded.

“I think we have to explore all those options,” Banks said.

Balancing affordability and water revenue

Despite the city’s long list of needed system improvements, officials know that raising water rates could make the service unaffordable in a place where 1-in-4 residents live below the poverty line.

Even if Jackson leaders had the political will to raise customers’ rates, paying for a $1 billion municipal bond would add $55 to $60 a month in charges to every household, or about a full day’s work on minimum wage, according to associate professor Manuel Teodoro of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.

In 2017, Philadelphia took an innovative approach to address affordability: its Tiered Assistance Program, the first of its kind in the country, allows low-income residents to make payments based on earnings rather than water usage, and it also provides a path for debt forgiveness. Like in Jackson, many Philadelphia residents had built up water debt and weren’t contributing to the city’s water revenue. Since TAP began, the city simultaneously reduced water bill debt and increased the number of customers paying for the service.

Henrietta Locklear, vice president at financial consultant firm Raftelis, worked on Philadelphia’s assistance program and told Mississippi Today that such a system could work in Jackson should the city decide to increase water rates.

“The role is really more to say, ‘We have to have rate increases, and we know it’s going to affect some of our customers detrimentally, and we’re offering assistance to help customers in need,’” Locklear said.

Adjusting the water billing formula

Another way to stabilize revenue could be to adjust the city’s billing formula. Ajami, the Stanford policy expert, explained that while Jackson’s first priority is addressing emergency repairs to its system, the city should also aim to maximize its future water funding.

Jackson, like many cities, charges residents based on both water usage and tiered pricing, which adds a fee after a certain threshold. Customers are charged $3.21 per hundred cubic feet, and then a $7 flat fee is added after 300 cubic feet, or a little over 2,000 gallons, according to a city spokesperson.

Cities rely heavily on volumetric, or use-based, pricing because the more water a utility treats and delivers, the more strain it puts on the system. Yet volumetric pricing can leave a utility with varying revenue returns, Ajami said.

“If you use a gallon or 10 gallons, I still need to operate the treatment plant, I still need to maintain the pipes, I still need to operate the pumps,” Ajami said. “If people use less (water), they’re paying less, and then I have less money to do all those things.”

She said that Jackson would benefit from some combination of its current system and a “decoupled” rate — a common format for energy bills — which includes a fixed rate that pays for the utility’s routine operating costs.

Doyle added that the varying, volumetric nature of water bills stands out from other government revenue streams.

“A lot of the services we get are not use-based,” he said. Many roads, for instance, are mostly paid for by property taxes, not by how much a person drives. “Same thing for jails, same thing for city governments, same thing for school systems.”

In light of affordability issues, Doyle and Ajami both wondered why the U.S. has no federal safety net for water bills.

“You can get money from the federal government to assist you in being able to pay for household food and energy,” Doyle said. “You can’t get that for water, and that’s kind of weird.”

Ajami agreed, pointing to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for energy bills, and the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program that helps with phone bills.

“In a way you’re all subsidizing access to communication, which is important,” she said, “but if we have something like that, why can’t we have something similar for water?”

A “barometer” of segregation

Jackson leaders in the past few weeks have asked state and federal officials to provide the city with money to begin repairing its water and sewer system.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba met with newly-appointed EPA Administrator Michael Regan to discuss funding avenues, and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson pledged to support any request for federal help.

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann told Mississippi Today that state legislators “want to help.” Yet Hosemann, as well as Gov. Tate Reeves and Sen. Hyde-Smith, have criticized the city’s management of its past funding without mentioning other systemic causes that led to the crisis.

Mississippi Today reported on Wednesday that legislative leaders killed the city’s main ask to improve its water system: allow the Jackson City Council’s proposal to increase the city’s sales tax by 1 cent to be placed on to a citywide ballot.

“If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.” Harvey Johnson Jr., former Jackson mayor

Activists and academics who spoke with Mississippi Today described the way racism has fueled the inability of the 82% Black-city to address infrastructure needs, from white flight to a lack of state support.

Yet even with more state-led enthusiasm, Mississippi alone can’t afford Jackson’s funding needs, said former Jackson city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

“While we always talk about, ‘We want more help from the state,’ the state doesn’t really have a big pool of money available to flow down to municipalities for this,” Priester said.

Priester and Johnson, Jackson’s former mayor, emphasized that the federal government’s deflated water funding has only inflated the city’s need. For instance, Jackson is struggling to fight its way out of an EPA consent decree for violations under the Clean Water Act, and last year received a $500,000 fine for violations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

“There’s no resources coming from the federal government to help local governments to meet those standards,” Johnson said. “If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.”

Ajami agrees that political willingness is part of the issue, adding that the disconnect between Americans and how they receive water may be why there’s a lack of political pressure.

“Because it’s easy to access water for a majority of Americans, people don’t think about the complexity of the system that brings water to us,” she said. “You drive on the road, so if there are potholes, you experience them. You don’t see water pipes. It’s a hidden infrastructure that we don’t value as much, while it’s the most essential resource we depend on in our daily life.”

Ajami also underscored the impacts of funding shortages on a city’s poorer and disadvantaged citizens: they can’t afford to rely on bottled water or a filtration system, and they’re left with an aging infrastructure that their local government can’t afford to fix.

“We’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities.” Dr. Martin Doyle

Cities have fallen into a cycle where the inability to afford repairs compounds the effects of the broken system, which is largely what created the desperation Jackson felt this past month. That’s why, Doyle explained, water utilities have become a good indicator of disparities across the country.

“Paying for water in a rich city is, on a per population basis, very cheap,” he said. “Paying for water in a poorer city on a per population basis is really expensive. So we’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities. That’s why I think one of the best barometers of how that big sorting in America is actually taking place is in the water utilities.”

Is water back on in Jackson?

All Jackson water customers now have water running through their faucets although some areas of the city are still experiencing low water pressure, Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday.

Williams said he determined residents are getting water from checking with residents in areas where shortages were occurring and gauging the water pressure in nearby fire hydrants.

Jackson is still under a boil notice

A majority of Jackson's water customers remain under a citywide boil water notice, meaning the water is still unsafe to drink or use for other common activities such as brushing teeth unless it is boiled first.

The about 43,000 customers on the surface water system might see the boil water notice lifted this week, provided the city is able to sample the water supply on two consecutive days.

The city last week lifted a notice on the 16,000 customers who receive their water from the city's well system. Those customers live in parts of south Jackson and Byram.

No disaster declaration in Mississippi

There is still no federal disaster declaration in Mississippi as the city of Jackson enters the fourth week of its water crisis.

Gov. Tate Reeves has until to submit Sunday a declaration to the White House and FEMA.

Several southern states have been approved for emergency declarations that open the door for federal assistance amid recovery from brutal winter storms that knocked out power and water services to millions in February.

Show Caption Hide Caption Stop the Violence march Dozens of marchers took to Congress Street to condemn rising gun violence in the city of Jackson on Sunday, April 25, 2021. Sarah Haselhorst, Mississippi Clarion Ledger

Almost a month has passed since Justin McNeal was fatally shot on Interstate 220 while driving home from Ridgeland after a job interview to be a certified nursing assistant.

McNeal was only 24 when he died March 28. He was the type of person to give you the shirt off his back, girlfriend Mercedez Ramsey said Sunday.

Now, his friends and family wear shirts emblazoned with his name. His smile. His memory.

""Justice for Justin,"" his father, Jermaine McNeal's, T-shirt reads. ""Until we meet again,"" runs across the back of Ramsey's.

They were among those gathered Sunday afternoon in front of the Mississippi State Capitol stairs for a ""Stop the Violence"" march organized by Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes to address surging gun violence in Jackson.

Dozens of residents marched from the Capitol to City Hall, several carrying posters bearing the names and faces of victims.

Surging crime: Community forum exposes resident fears, challenges in Jackson's violent crime response

""Black lives matter,"" Hinds County District 2 Supervisor David Archie began the cadence as marchers strode down Congress Street. ""Black people matter. Black children matter. Black families matter. Black communities matter. Everybody matters.""

Stokes looked across the growing crowd in front of City Hall steps and said, ""We declare a war on violence.""

The march came on the heels of Jackson's 48th homicide committed this year. Officials credit the pandemic, ease of access to weapons and the city's police officer shortage for the rise in violence.

""We shouldn't be at each other's throats no matter what's going on in society,"" Priscilla Sterling, Jackson resident and cousin of Emmett Till, said. ""Our officials need to be involved in the increase of everything that is going on, from the gun violence to the water crisis, especially the racial inequalities.""

'Life in Jackson, Mississippi, has been devalued'

Alongside marchers and Stokes, Hinds County Sheriff Lee Vance, Jackson Police Chief James Davis and Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owens took the City Hall steps, each condemning gun violence and urging residents to share what they know.

These types of crimes are nearly impossible to predict and prevent, Davis told the crowd. While deputies saturate the streets, he said, the department is working to recruit more people and increase community communication.

According to previous Clarion Ledger reporting, the Jackson Police Department is still short 58 officers, despite adding three classes of recruits. Last month, the Jackson City Council approved allocating $500,000 for Hinds County Sheriff's Office deputies on city streets to help with the shortage of city officers.

Vance is first to say he doesn't have all the answers, but he assured marchers the Hinds County and Jackson departments are working tirelessly and together to defuse violence.

""Life in Jackson, Mississippi, has been devalued too much to where it seems business as usual when three of four people get shot every day,"" Vance said.

For the criminal justice system to work fully, Owens said it's going to take the community's voice and effort.

""I demand you to stop being quiet,"" said Shannon Anderson, whose 22-year-old son Oren was shot to death in broad daylight in December. ""Y'all know you're gonna call the police when someone breaks into your house, but y'all don't wanna call the police when someone's child is slain in the street.""

Over the past 30 days, Germaine McNeal hasn't come any closer to finding out who killed his son. The family posted a $11,500 reward for information that would lead to an arrest in their son's death. No one has come forward.

But the McNeal family will not rest until they get their answers.

There were all smiles on the field during Jackson State's 53-0 win over Edward Waters on Sunday.

A COVID-limited sold out crowd of 11,000 fans showed up. The Tigers' defense anchored the program's first shutout since 2014. Even Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman showed up on the sidelines to support former Dallas Cowboys teammate Deion Sanders as he coached his first college football game.

There was just one noticeable issue inside of Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium - there was no running water.

The City of Jackson and surrounding areas have been without water or have experienced extremely low pressure for the greater part of the last two weeks since last week's winter storm rocked the state.

Jackson State's football stadium was no exception to the city's water crisis, as all attendees, media, players, coaches, fans and stadium workers alike had to use portable toilets. Aikman was seen carrying a jug of water into the stadium upon arrival.

The reality didn't hit Sanders until he received his Gatorade bath in the closing seconds of the win.

""(It was) cold, and sticky,"" Sanders said. ""The first thing that came to my mind is, 'We don't have a shower. We don't have water. We have a shower, but we don't have water.' That's the first thing that came to my mind.""

The Pro Football Hall of Famer said he expected the bath to come, so he prepared for the moment by bringing a fresh change of clothes.

""It was good though,"" Sanders said. ""Especially my kids enjoyed it the most. I think they enjoyed it the most. Just to share that first moment with your sons is incredible.""

As far as the actual game goes, Sanders said the stadium's water situation didn't bother his focus.

""We couldn't tell,"" Sanders said. ""I think the only time water is a concern is during the timeouts, and we took care of that. The staff took care of that, so we're fine in that aspect.""

The coach said he was unsure if running water returned to the stadium on Tuesday afternoon.

""I don't know what's going on outside this building, and outside the walls of this team,"" Sanders said.

About four miles away from the stadium on JSU's campus, water was still out as of Wednesday evening. The University encouraged all students to return home until the conflict could get resolved. The University will remain open to those who can't travel

Not all of the residents of Jackson, Miss., have had clean water restored — weeks after a winter storm. It's leading to major questions over emergency preparedness, and the state of infrastructure.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

This morning, thousands of residents in Jackson, Miss., still do not have access to running water or have to boil what comes out of their tap. It's been nearly three weeks since a winter storm wreaked havoc on Jackson's infrastructure. Areas with mostly Black and low-income residents are still affected. Shalina Chatlani of the Gulf States Newsroom has more.

SHALINA CHATLANI, BYLINE: At Forest Hill High School, senior Deon Sanders pulls a latch on a massive water tank.

DEON SANDERS: When you push this up, water going to come out from right there.

CHATLANI: Sanders is a volunteer at this water drive-through. He says dozens of people have showed up this week, including some of his classmates.

SANDERS: They said their water would cut off. They couldn't flush the toilet or whatever. So they had to come out here and get some water.

CHATLANI: The city of Jackson says that, as of Sunday, there were fewer than 10 water main breaks in the system; less than a thousand residents had no water or little water pressure. The total population is about 160,000. The majority of the city still has boil-water notices. But Charles Williams, city engineer for Jackson, says those should be lifted and other problems solved by the end of this week. He says there are a few next steps.

CHARLES WILLIAMS: Make sure that all of our residents are restored with water, take samples, get our storage tanks filled.

CHATLANI: The areas of Jackson still impacted are predominantly Black and low-income. And some residents say even if their water is on, it comes out dirty. So to get by, people are going to drive-through giveaways and collecting rainwater, staying clean with alcohol wipes or going to a friend's to bathe. And three weeks into this crisis, residents are now dealing with issues that go far beyond the plumbing - for example, Forest Hill High School.

ROCKY KHANNA: Several hundred students were without water.

CHATLANI: Rocky Khanna is a teacher at Forest Hill. He says they were starting to bring students back to the classroom with COVID-19 safety precautions, but during the storm, the school had to close. It still doesn't have water.

KHANNA: And we have to have a certain level of water pressure or water to actually return.

CHATLANI: Khanna says the school has been busing meals to students and making sure they have water. But he's afraid these last few weeks could further slow down students.

KHANNA: Or they may not even have access to the Wi-Fi and Internet.

CHATLANI: Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba says it's important that the city invests in low-income communities, even after the water is turned back on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHOKWE LUMUMBA: What is the poverty rate? What is the quality of education? What is the stability of our infrastructure? Development goals that really should be the metric of success of any economy.

CHATLANI: Lumumba says residents need access to basic resources so they are prepared to weather any storm.

This wouldn’t happen in a Whiter town.,"Many of the state’s White political leaders appear indifferent to the dangers to a largely Black population from a dilapidated water system.

He focused instead on problems the city has had with its water billing system. “I do think it’s really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments,” Reeves said, “before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money.”","Many of the state’s White political leaders appear indifferent to the dangers to a largely Black population from a dilapidated water system.

70,2 weeks ago,Mississippi Free Press,Jackson Maddox Well System Repairs Continue,"The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

The TV Road Well is still operating with a temporary pump. In a statement, City of Jackson Communications Director Michelle Atoa explained that a permanent pump for TV Road would be delivered and installed later this week, hopefully bringing an end to the newest manifestation of chronic water problems facing the City of Jackson.

Jackson Maddox Well System provides water to roughly 16,000 connections through six wells. The loss of operations at the two wells in May has caused outages, low water pressure, and undrinkable water for around 2,000 of those connections, located in south Jackson and Byram.

As with most water system outages, the dual well failures have put pressure on higher elevated areas first, without sufficient water output to keep the highest homes pressurized.

“When you have two well systems that are down at the same time, obviously you’re not able to put as much pressure into the system as you’d like,” Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams explained at a press event last week.

A series of setbacks have extended the well failures. Last week’s inclement weather delayed the final pump installation. At the same press event, Williams acknowledged that the City of Jackson had to seek replacement pumps for the two wells out of state.

In spite of the newly installed pump at Siwell Road, the boil-water notice for affected connections remains in effect as the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water in the affected areas: multiple days of clean samples are required before the boil water notice is lifted. Currently, MSDH is testing samples derived from well connections. Atoa told the Mississippi Free Press today that results from the testing are expected in the coming days.

Precautionary boil water notices are not a guarantee of unsafe water, but are required when pressure drops below a certain level. Under-pressurized pipes can draw in groundwater from surrounding pockets near pipe joints and breaks, potentially introducing untreated water into the low-pressure system.

“When we get TV Road back online, we’ll breathe a little easier,” Williams explained to WAPT News, adding that with both wells replaced, “hopefully we’ll end this particular water crisis.”

This particular crisis comes only a few months after a different segment of Jackson’s water utilities faced catastrophe, when many surface water connections tied into the city’s distribution system and water treatment plants spent nearly a month without water pressure. The Jackson water crisis revealed systemic failures to adequately repair and improve the city’s aging water infrastructure, spurred by decades of population loss and disinvestment.

The ongoing well-pump failures represent the second time in a year—the first in September 2020—that the Jackson Maddox Well System has experienced significant outages. In last week’s press event, Williams suggested that improper repair during that first outage contributed to the problems continuing into 2021, but promised that additional care had been taken to ensure that this set of repairs would last.","The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

73,"Apr 7, 2021",WLBT,EPA sent Jackson emergency administrative order on water system,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - There are alarming new details about the condition of Jackson’s water treatment system.

We’ve learned that over a year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency sent an emergency administrative order demanding the city fix the water system or face hefty fines.

Documents show this emergency administrative order was sent to the city last March. We’ve heard city officials talk about the EPA inspecting the water treatment plants and this report details what they found.

The EPA report was critical saying Jackson’s water treatment plants were being mismanaged, had routine equipment failures, vital positions to monitor water treatment were not staffed which could lead to water contamination.

The report also said that plant conditions present imminent and substantial endangerment to the people served by the system.

It also said that turbidity disinfection treatment concerns condition of the system has potential for presence of e.coli in the water. City council members, who just learned about the report a year after it was sent to the city, were alarmed.

Councilman Kenneth Stokes said that with all the problems the city’s having with the water system, it may be better to have someone else manage it.

Stokes said, “If the city cannot run it properly and we’re going to experience these water problems every winter where people are going weeks and months without water, then we need to do something different. If something different means we need to get private companies in here to run our water plant, then so be it.”

The city is making nearly $5 million in repairs at both of their water treatment plants. Some city leaders now wonder if the system failure during the ice storm could have been avoided, if only they knew what the EPA had found.

Councilman Ashby Foote said, “It was a great wake up call for the City of Jackson, ordered by the EPA for the emergency that might lie ahead and sure enough we got hit by that emergency, shut down the water system for weeks in some areas of Jackson. Really disrupted the livelihood and quality of life for our citizens, and the city had been warned about that but the council that had not been warned about it and that’s really disappointing.”

Mayor Lumumba sent a letter to the EPA last year promising to follow their guidelines and make repairs. Members of the council hope to have a healthy discussion about that and why they were kept out of the loop at next weeks council meeting.

74,"Feb 20, 2021",WLBT,Timeline for water reconnection for Jackson residents still unknown,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Several Jackson residents have little to no water pressure.

This is because the city’s water operations were crippled by this week’s winter storm.

At this time, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he can’t give a definitive day or time when the water system will be restored.

However, he said the system is thawing out and making progress.

Wanting to help those in need, city leaders pounded the pavement delivering water to those who’ve been without water for the last couple of days.

A large part of the deliveries were aimed at elderly residents and those who are home-bound.

One of the people on the receiving end is Elease Morgan.

On her 97th birthday, the only gift the birthday girl wanted was a case of water.

Her wish was granted and the bottled waters were personally delivered to her by Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

“It’s a happy moment just to know that you are thought about,” Morgan expressed.

The longtime Jackson resident said she already knows how she’s going to use the water she received.

“Mostly to wash dishes, my hands, and medication,” she said.

“I know what it means not to have water,” said Councilman Stokes. “You can’t flush your toilet, then you talk about no water to drink when you’re thirsty, can’t cook. They need water, and it should be our responsibility to help them.”

Also stepping up to help is Mayor Lumumba.

He and others spent Saturday dropping off cases of water to residents living in assisted living faculties.

“We are getting the water to you, as soon as we can get it ourselves,” said Lumumba.

The mayor said this water is critical, in particular, because he doesn’t know when everyone’s water will be turned back on.

This comes after valves were frozen due to the wintry weather.

“I think that I owe the residents honesty and so I’m gonna always be honest that I cannot give you a precise date and time, but I can say that we are seeing improvements across the city,” the mayor said. “That means that the system is cranking up and pushing more because it is thawing out.”

Lumumba said the water system thawing out is good news, but now they’re bracing themselves for another round of challenges.

“The next challenge that we have to observe is that as they increase the psi, what typically takes place is that you have ruptured in the pipes, and then we’ll have to go out and fix those leaks that will be present and are present at this time,” Lumumba explained. “We haven’t seen them yet because the water hasn’t gotten fully through the lines to reveal them, so as those reveal themselves that will be the next phase of this process. We ask our residents for their patience. We thank them for being patient thus far, and we’re doing all that we can to get the water to them.”

As the city continues to work on its water system, city leaders want to provide water to those who are in need.

If you’re a Jackson resident looking for water, you’re asked to contact your local council member, or dial 311.

In addition to 311 , residents can call one of the following numbers:

601.960.1111

76,"Feb 25, 2021",Jackson Free Press,Daggers Drawn: Lumumba and Stokes Trade Blame As City Suffers Water Crisis,"Amid a water crisis in the wake of a serious winter-weather storm, Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes gave dueling statements during the week, trading accusations of negligence.

""Rookie mistakes of the mayor have proven costly to the city of Jackson, especially children, elderly, disabled and businesses,"" Stokes said Wednesday in an interview with WAPT. ""The issue is senior citizens in this city without water. They couldn't even have water to flush toilets. You wouldn't want that for your mother, any of your loved ones.""

Stokes said that the City's delay in providing tankers to supply water to Jacksonians still without water for over a week was the last straw for him and rejected the mayor's claim that he is spreading misinformation.



The sharp criticisms were in sharp contrast to Stokes’ past endorsement of Lumumba for mayor. Stokes was also close to and endorsed the mayor’s father, a former councilman and activist who died during his first term as mayor.

Lumumba gave a press conference Tuesday in an apparent broadside against Stokes’ earlier comments, defending his administration's effort at providing water for residents. He said what happened is an act of God and rejected the allegation of incompetence against him.

""The crisis that we are in the midst of was an act of God, not through incompetence, not through a failure to act from any individual, not from a failure to act from the administration,"" Lumumba said. ""We offer as proof of the fact that this is an act of God is you just simply have to look at all of the places that this weather affected, and the fact that communities are experiencing the same trauma that our residents are experiencing today—Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas Canton, Mississippi, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Louisiana, and many more.""

Stokes: Tankers ‘Not An Act of God’

Stokes, however, said that ""the issue of tankers is not an act of God,” adding, “Let me say that because they tried to merge the cold weather and ice to tankers. Tankers could have been on the streets in Jackson long before.""

In the Wednesday interview, Stokes picked holes in the mayor's claims. He said that if the city had a white mayor, people would have been marching the streets. He claimed that Lumumba initially rejected renting a tanker because he did not like the business person who has the tanker. He did not mention who this person is. He declined to mention his name after the reporter spoke with him on the phone. The mayor’s communication manager Michelle Atoa said she has no information in response to Stokes' comments.

""This mayor had an opportunity to do something, and he did not,"" Stokes said. ""They had a businessman who had two tankers, (City Council President and Ward 6) Councilman (Aaron) Banks got one of them up, tried to get the city to pay, the mayor said I don't like him."" Banks, however, declined to respond to questions from the Jackson Free Press concerning Stokes' claims.

""So that way the citizens, the older people especially, can't have water to flush their toilet! So Councilman Banks, at that point, was reaching out to get others to pay for it. At that point, the City said they were going to pay for one tanker.”

In his response, the mayor said Stokes does “things just to give the appearance of work.”

Stokes, a long-time member of the Jackson City Council (interrupted by a stint as a Hinds County supervisor) defended himself against the mayor's accusation that he is incompetent by saying that he has introduced more legislation and passed more resolutions than any other council members.

Lumumba: Political Bickering Not Helping

The mayor on Tuesday said all the political bickering is not helping as the city tries to recover from the weather and water crisis.

""I'm calling up to those individuals that we have to work with—our council people. It isn't helpful (that) we're in the midst of a crisis, and we make it a political discussion, or we make it a fight,” Lumumba said.

The mayor said that he has been in communication with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and other agencies for support. He has personally given out 10 pallets of water, he said, adding that his house has also been without water and understands how people feel.

""The failure to have tankers in certain locations was not due to a lack of recognition of the challenge as it was a lack of availability; there were no tankers available to us,"" he said. ""We gave what we had; we gave what we could find.""

Lumumba said that transportation problem caused by the winter storm made it difficult to get their tankers here and that it is very difficult for him to reach the Ward 3 councilman, an allegation Stokes did not deny, saying that he cannot sit and talk with the mayor.

""You do not sit and talk and play with a liar,"" Stokes said and leveled a litany of complaints against the mayor unrelated to the water crisis. The Ward 3 councilman is known for being hard to reach by telephone.

In a statement, Banks said, ""At this time during the crisis of the majority of the city being without water, it is important that we all work together to come to the aid of our citizens.""

""You do not sit and talk and play with a liar,"" Stokes said and leveled a litany of complaints against the mayor unrelated to the water crisis."
77,"Mar 18, 2021",Chattanooga Times Free Press,Chattanooga's faith community mobilizes to help in Mississippi water crisis,"Area churches mobilized in the past week to address the ongoing water crisis in Mississippi, where some residents have gone a month without clean water following a winter storm in February.

Last weekend, Orchard Park Seventh-day Adventist Church hosted a drive on its church campus for people to drop off water donations. The church in Orchard Knob partnered with First Baptist Church and Southern Adventist University to deliver water to communities nearly 400 miles away.

Troy Brand, senior pastor at Orchard Park, said he was shocked with the level of generosity and support from the community.

""What we thought would be one truck full of water, what we thought would be a nice deed, became three U-Haul trucks,"" he said.

Residents of Jackson, Mississippi, were advised to boil their water before consumption after a series of winter storms in February damaged local water infrastructure. For weeks, some residents did not have running water at all, according to the Associated Press.

Brand said notice about the donation campaign was sent through the Kingdom Partners network in Chattanooga last week.

At the same time, Southern Adventist University put a notice out to its campus to collect donations as part of the effort, said Stephanie Guster, senior advisor for diversity to the president. Someone from campus volunteered to drive the truck to Mississippi, she said.

Guster said Christians are called to care for those in need and this was a great opportunity to live out the lessons of the Bible.

""The gospel mandate, 'Go ye into all the world,' there's no geographic or demographic limit on that, even if it's two states away,"" she said. ""Christ's calling is to help everyone in need.""

Brand said he was reminded of the people and donations that came to Chattanooga last April when the region was rocked by a series of tornadoes that left nine people dead and caused millions of dollars of damage to homes and businesses.

""People just helped us out here in Chattanooga. It becomes reciprocal, especially when you know something is going to be lasting a long time. I think it was critical to give them some help,"" Brand said.

On Sunday morning, Brand rode down to Mississippi to drop off the donations. People were already lining up to get water, he said. The Chattanooga area, he estimated, delivered around a dozen pallets of water to Mississippi.

78,"Apr 13, 2021",WLBT,Mayor says EPA order not about water quality; a copy of the order seems to say different,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said Jackson water quality is not unsafe, and that an EPA order is more “a discussion over process than it is over quality of water.”

Tuesday, Jackson leaders discussed an emergency administrative order handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the city’s public water system.

Lumumba refused to go into details during the open session but said Jackson’s water quality has never been in question.

“I would say this is more a discussion over process than it is over quality of water,” he said. “It would be not only a failure of the city of Jackson, (but) it would be a failure of the Mississippi State Department of Health … for us to OK bad water for the residents of Jackson.”

A copy of the March 2020 Emergency Administrative Order from the EPA, though, seems to say different.

The order, as well as correspondence associated with the order, was sent to the mayor on March 27, 2020, by EPA Region Four.

In it, the agency states that “conditions exist at the system that present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the persons served by the system.”

Federal officials conducted inspections at the O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell water treatment plants, at the behest of the state health department.

The order goes on to state that the EPA identified numerous concerns related to “bacterial contamination and proper disinfection.”

EPA did an inspection of the city’s water treatment plants in February 2020, after the city failed to provide the proper reports to the agency for nearly three years.

Among findings, EPA determined that equipment at both plants was not properly calibrated to “provide accurate dosing for proper treatment of drinking water.” In other words, the city could not determine whether it was putting the accurate amount of chemicals in the water being treated.

Inspectors also found that monitoring equipment at O.B. Curtis had not been repaired or calibrated in three years after a technician position at the plant had been vacated. Respondents also were unable to perform membrane integrity tests and had failed to perform filter maintenance at both plants.

Curtis provides water to more than 43,000 connections across the city. It treats water brought in from the Ross Barnett Reservoir.

Meanwhile, jar tests, which are used to check things like the amount of sedimentation in treated water, were not up to industry standards.

As for water quality itself, turbidity exceedances had been reported at both plants in January 2020.

Turbidity, or the cloudiness of the water, is a good indicator of whether disease-causing organisms are present.

“Particles of turbidity provide shelter for microbes and reduce the microbes’ exposure to disinfectants,” the EPA states. “if particulate material is not removed, a high turbidity event can provide shelter for and promote regrowth of pathogens in the water, leading to an outbreak of waterborne diseases.”

Samples taken on Feb. 23, 2021, at the height of the city’s water crisis, showed samples had turbidity levels of greater than 1.0 turbidity units, much higher than the industry standard of 0.3 turbidity units the city said at the time.

Following that sampling, the city told residents not to drink the water without boiling it.

Inspectors found other problems, as well, including UV disinfection devices that were “offline for significant periods of time” at both water treatment plants, with one at the Fewell plant being offline for 3.5 months. Eight other UV reactors were offline anywhere from two to 31 days, the report stated.

“Despite actions taken by MSDH, the local authorities have not undertaken all actions necessary to protect the public health, and conditions exist at the system that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons served by the system,” the report states.

Pumps at the O.B. Curtis malfunctioned following the winter storm, contributing to the city's water crisis. (WLBT)

Lumumba said the council needed to go into executive session to discuss the matter, arguing that the administration was still in talks with the EPA regarding compliance.

He further claimed the city had not shared more details of the EPA’s findings, saying a final order from the federal agency had not been handed down.

“The reason we haven’t sent (it) out is because the draft hasn’t been finalized by any party. When there is a completed document that both the EPA and the city of Jackson agree to, it will be issued,” he said. “It would be premature to do it prior to that.”

Ward One Councilman Ashby Foote attempted to challenge the mayor on claims that the order was still in draft form, but was shut down by Council President Aaron Banks, who also said the matter needed to be discussed in a closed session.

Foote said the administration was in talks with EPA over a potential consent decree regarding its water treatment plants. However, those negotiations were separate from the 2020 administrative order.

“He’s trying to cover up the fact they didn’t tell anyone about this,” he said.

The councilman also asked why the mayor was unwilling to discuss the EPA’s findings in an open forum, saying that it was bad optics for city government.

The mayor has been criticized for not informing residents about the EPA order, despite it being handed down more than a year ago.

“One of the biggest problems with this issue is the fact that there was no public announcement when it happened in March 2020. I didn’t find out about it until a week ago,” Foote said.

Documents obtained by WLBT through an open record request bring into question the mayor’s claims Tuesday that the order issued by the EPA was a draft document.

In the March 27, 2020 correspondence to Lumumba, the EPA states that the order “constitutes a final agency action” under the Safe Water Drinking Act. However, it goes on to state that the city could seek federal review.

And in an April 1, 2020 letter the mayor sent to the agency, Lumumba seems to understand that fact.

“The city will use its best efforts to rectify the deficiencies identified in the Emergency Administrative Order. I acknowledge the gravity of this situation and the responsibility to ensure a safe supply of drinking water to the public.”

In that document, Lumumba went on to say that the city “looks forward to working with the EPA and the Mississippi State Department of Health to achieve compliance with this … Order as quickly as practicable.”

Mississippi Moral Monday! 🚨WATCH Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II joins the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign for Moral Monday live from Jackson, MS with a major national announcement of the Mass Poor People’s and Low Wage Workers’ Assembly and Moral March on Washington! ***To see StreamText captions: www.bit.ly/PPC_2021 Posted by Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival on Monday, April 19, 2021

The Poor People's Campaign announced its second virtual Mass Poor People’s and Low-Wage Workers’ Assembly — set for June 21 — on Monday during a stop in Mississippi.

Officials also announced an in-person event, Moral March on Washington, in 2022.

The campaign strives to challenge policy disproportionately affecting the nation's poor and low-income people.

People came together at Smith Park in Jackson to discuss the impact of the state's health care disparities, the pandemic, a monthlong water crisis, racism and centuries of voter suppression in Mississippi.

""It's time for a new day in Mississippi,"" Bishop Thomas Jenkins of Jackson said during an opening prayer. ""Our people have suffered too long.""

Two residents shared their stories of past incarceration that led to their disenfranchisement. Benny Ivey of Jackson spent 11 years in prison on drug charges. Now, Ivey is over a decade into recovery. He has a family and mentors troubled teen. But Ivey still can't vote.

""What more do I have to do?"" Ivey asked. ""Our word don't mean nothing.""

Other residents discussed the impact of violence, poverty and discrimination in the state.

The issues of 2021 are the same as the 1960s and 1970s, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. The worst form of violence is poverty, he told organizers and eventgoers.

The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, Poor People’s Campaign co-chair, pointed to five interlocking injustices that affect both Mississippians and the nation. The campaign strives to address the following injustices: systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism and a distorted moral narrative of religious nationalism

Residents in Mississippi are one slice of the 140 million low-income and poor people in the United States, according to the campaign's website.

Mississippi joins 44 states in the campaign's organizing efforts to address the five interlocking injustices. Last year, over two million people attended a Poor People's Campaign virtual nationwide rally that placed inequality at the forefront of lawmakers' minds, Barber said.

""It's time for poor and low-wage people to flex our power,"" Barber said. ""If you lift from the bottom, then everybody rises.""

81,1 month ago,WLBT,"Siwell Road well could be back online by Friday, best-case scenario","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Another 1,000 customers on the city of Jackson’s water well system will soon be under a boil water notice, said Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams.

The city gave an update on its efforts to repair the two wells that failed Tuesday morning, leaving thousands of customers again with little or no water pressure.

Williams said that best-case scenario, the larger well will go online again Friday, with crews turning their attention to the other well next week.

Meanwhile, some 16,000 customers in South Jackson and Byram are currently under boil water and conserve water notices.

To help those customers until service is restored, the city already has at least one water giveaway scheduled. That will be held at 4 p.m. Tuesday at Siwell Road Middle School. The school is located at 1983 N. Siwell Rd.

Tuesday morning, the city announced that two wells, including one at Siwell Road and one at TV Road in South Jackson had gone down, leaving just four in operation.

Williams said crews are now concentrating on repairing the wells and will focus first on the one at Siwell Road.

“We are basically assessing the situation while the contractor is on-site and are breaking down the well to determine the cause of that failure,” Williams said. “We hope to have some information available tomorrow.”

Williams said it will likely be “well into next week” before crews will know the severity of the TV Road well failure.

Areas affected by the disruptions include the TV Road area, Maddox Road, U.S. Highway 18, Willowood, Cedar Hills, Siwell Road, Terry Road, Spring Ridge Road, and Gary Road.

“We’re asking for your patience. For residents on the well system with water, we’re asking (you) to conserve water over the next two days and into the weekend,” he said. “We have been blessed that the weather has been cool, so there’s not a tremendous strain on the system (like we had when) both wells went down in September 2020.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba also voiced calls for patience, saying that the city is still amid a water crisis.

“Because of our aged infrastructure... until we can comprehensively, effectively address it … we will continue to fight with this system,” he said.

“We know how difficult it is. We know what a challenge and sacrifice it is to go without water for cooking, for bathing, for sanitary purposes,” he added.

The mayor again reiterated the need for federal aid in addressing the city’s water system needs.

“We are looking for an infrastructure package to come from the federal government. We know that Sen. (Roger) Wicker just had a bipartisan meeting with the president, and we are tuned into the results of such meetings,” he said. “We want all of our U.S. delegation to know Jackson is paying heavy attention to the work taking place there.”

He also provided an update on efforts to improve service in South Jackson.

“We’re investing, two meetings ago, (the council voted) to pay for a $7 million pipe that will better improve pressure to South Jackson.”

South Jackson is located farthest away from the city’s main water treatment plants and typically is hit hardest when there are disruptions in service and water pressure in the system drops.

Following severe winter storms in February, some customers in the Forest Hills area, for instance, experienced little or no water pressure for several weeks.

When a winter storm knocked out water service to tens of thousands of Mississippi residents, it was Black families that were hit hardest—and who organized their own relief efforts. Why you can trust us By Aallyah Wright 7 MIN READ

For Rukia Lumumba, this time was different.

In February 2021, a winter weather warning prompted the native of Jackson, Mississippi, to take precautions, just as she had two years ago when another winter storm hit her hometown. She adjusted the thermostats in her home, filled her bathtub with water, and left the water faucets dripping so the pipes wouldn’t freeze, she said.

The next morning, Lumumba could get only a trickle of water from her faucets. Days went by, and her water did not return.

“This storm lasted four to five days,” she said. “The ice was so thick. The conditions were so different.” Ice covered the roads for days, she said, and stores like Walmart sold out of cases of bottled water.

The back-to-back winter storms in February left about 43,000 homes without access to running water for nearly a month. The cold temperatures caused water plant equipment to freeze and centuries-old water pipes to break, city officials say, which will take more than $2 billion to fix. The water pressure dropped, the system shut down, and service interruptions were disproportionately felt in communities farthest from the city’s water sources, especially in West and South Jackson, areas whose populations are largely Black.

In the time of crisis, grassroots organizing helped the community secure essential needs where the local and state governments came up short. Lumumba, the executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, received several text messages and phone calls alerting her of others without water. The Jackson-based nonprofit describes itself as a community resource, capacity-building incubator and training ground for transformative justice in the South. Lumumba immediately began to organize from her home, calling folks she knew throughout the state who could help distribute water, blankets, and other essential items, she said.

“Literally, just after the storm, we hit the ground running, even with ice on the ground,” she said. “We began to safely distribute things for people, and it was a very dangerous job. There were times I myself felt that I wasn’t gonna make it.”

The roads topped with ice and store closures made it nearly impossible to reach the community.

The city of Jackson operates two water treatment plants, some of whose pipes date back to the 1900s. The Ross Barnett Reservoir and the Pearl River serve as sources for the water utilities, said Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams at a March 19 virtual town hall.

It isn’t uncommon for residents to experience unsafe drinking water, and boil water notices are common, a city spokesperson said, but frequency of notices varies, depending on the situation. Jackson’s Public Works director told WLBT-TV that, for example, the city experienced nearly 500 main breaks in 2010, and almost 300 more in 2018. High levels of lead were found in the city’s water supply in 2016.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said during the town hall that he has asked for years for federal and state funding to alleviate the city’s infrastructure needs. The mayor, who is Rukia Lumumba’s brother, presented two options for state lawmakers to consider: Support a bill that allows the city to raise its sales tax by 1 cent to raise $14 million per year to fund repairs, or directly allocate $47 million in emergency relief for repairs to the water treatment facilities. The sales tax bill died without committee consideration, and instead lawmakers approved just $3 million to overhaul one of the water plants, saying the city could draw on the federal American Rescue Act for more infrastructure work.

The hurdles of improving a faulty water billing system, the city’s declining tax base, and low revenues mean Jackson cannot afford to make repairs, Mayor Lumumba said.

Antiquated infrastructure issues aren’t new in older cities. In the city of Mound Bayou, situated in the Mississippi Delta, for example, the water lines were installed before the 1970s, said Mayor Eulah Peterson. At some point, “everything wears out,” she said.

“You try to add on to systems that need to be fixed, then you got a situation where a major replacement is needed,” Peterson said. “We’re probably all experiencing what Jackson is experiencing, but it’s not as large.”

Tamiko Smith, a resident of South Jackson, grew worried when her water and power did not return on the second day after the storm. She couldn’t wash, cook, bathe, or flush her toilet. Most importantly, she said, she couldn’t help her husband, Otis, with his at-home dialysis treatments. Staying at home would intensify her husband’s health risks because water and electricity is necessary for his solution bag, she added. The couple had no choice but to check in to a hotel.

“Dialysis is a life-threatening thing,” Smith said. “You can’t go three or four days. It’s not good for a person because you could become septic if you don’t get your treatment.”

Once the power was turned back on three days later, the Smiths returned home. But they still had no water. Tamiko drove 15 minutes every day to her daughter’s house to fill and refill a water cooler until their water service at home was restored. This became a daunting task—filling gallon jugs with water, hauling it to the trunk of her SUV, then toting it into her house. Her water service finally returned two weeks later, she said.

Smith critiqued Gov. Tate Reeves’ slow response to summon help from the National Guard, emphasizing the additional barriers this placed on the elderly community, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities.

“When we were dealing with having no water, our governor was talking about removing the mask mandate. There are quite a few dialysis patients in (South Jackson),” she said.

Arekia Bennett, the director of Mississippi Votes, a millennial-led civic engagement organization, and a South Jackson resident, said what her family and others experienced is systemic racism. Frustration settled in for Bennett when her parents drove to North Jackson—where in some neighborhoods more than 80% of the population is White—to her brother’s house to take a shower. It became evident that there was a financial disinvestment in predominantly Black areas, Bennett said.

“If I’m in areas like Fondren (in North Jackson), and I drive 10 minutes back to South Jackson, you can literally see the changes in infrastructure. You can see the changes in dilapidated buildings and houses,” she said. “You can see the intentional redlining, clear disenfranchisement of people and their livelihoods.”

Bennett said that even the location of the Ross Barnett Reservoir showed the racism embedded in the city infrastructure. The reservoir and its treatment plant lie northeast of Jackson—closest to the White neighborhoods of the city—and the water system’s failure after the storm was felt hardest in the more distant Black neighborhoods.

Bennett and her parents finally got their water service restored three weeks after the storm hit. That moment took her back to 2015 when she spoke on a panel about “climate change being a real thing.” The lack of preparedness by Mississippi’s elected officials is unacceptable and officials must be held accountable, she said.

“People’s lives are not this political chess game,” she said. “We cannot afford to not be prepared for the real implications of not being prepared and what it could do and cause for folks who live literally worlds apart from the other side of Jackson.”

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, also helped people after the storm, such as moms who needed formula and groceries or laundry services, she said. She agreed with Bennett that it is incumbent on elected officials to be prepared because low-income families, for instance, do not have enough money or job security to prepare for a disaster.

“This is a human right,” she added. “(Lawmakers) have to really pass smart policies that ensure families can take care of themselves in a disaster.”

This is why organizers in the community like Welchlin and Rukia Lumumba stepped in.

Rukia Lumumba said it was in part to “save ourselves” from “willful and intentional neglect by the state to care for the needs of Jackson.” The People’s Advocacy Institute delivered water and food boxes to more than 15,000 homes and housed over 100 people in hotels. Also, her organization conducted wellness calls to thousands of residents, which allowed them to provide more relief. The nonprofit organization also raised more than $20,000 to give out in direct payments for residents to pay utility bills and for other needs.

Lumumba said that while the organization was conducting wellness checks, they learned that a lot of people had also lost their food stamps, food subsidies, or other benefits, and they were hearing that the state had not renewed some of those programs for those residents.

Many of those people were living on fixed incomes, she said. “That was a really big problem.”

While it’s still unclear when Jackson will have enough resources to overhaul its water system, one option the city council is considering would be to work with the Rural Water Emergency Assistance Cooperative, which creates partnerships between municipalities and water utilities to provide technical assistance, physical assistance, and mutual aid in times of need. That would bring in more volunteers and personnel in response to extreme weather events.

In the interim, on-the-ground organizers will continue to pressure lawmakers, while continuing to prioritize the well-being of the community.

“Our community really came together. We can’t wait on the government to meet our immediate needs,” Welchlin said. “We’ve been talking about how to make sure that our community has stockpiles ready for when disasters happen, so we won’t be in this kind of situation again.”

(CNN) The historic winter storm that crippled Texas during the third week of February spotlighted the Lone Star State's pervasive history of structural racism. Similarly, it revealed how seemingly universal crises, such as climate change and catastrophes sometimes referred to as ""acts of God"" affect some communities much more severely than others.

During the height of this record winter storm, 4 million Texans lost power, but those who lived on grids that connected hospitals, emergency responders, or downtown commercial buildings and condos were more likely to retain their power. Wealth, income and housing inequality make it much more likely for Black and Latinx families in Texas to live away from densely populated and more expensive parts of the city -- and when they do live in urban areas, to reside in places that are not deemed essential to the functioning of the electrical grid. They are more likely to live in areas lacking the robust infrastructure necessary to weather environmental and man-made catastrophes, environmental experts recently told The New York Times

Black and Latinx families, many already disproportionately impacted by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, experienced power outages, burst pipes, freezing temperatures and water shutdowns that illustrate the hidden cost of racism. The storm's aftershocks continue to be felt in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mississippi where many Black and brown residents continue to lack power, clean drinking water and shelter.

In Texas, almost two weeks after the storm, almost 400,000 people remain without clean water (after power outages halted the ability of municipalities to adequately ensure the safety of water systems, leading to boil water orders in some areas such as Austin), many of them apartment dwellers whose landlords have been slow to respond to the crisis . Some residents of Jackson, Mississippi , a predominantly Black city, have been left reeling from the storm's aftermath and are still struggling to obtain an adequate supply of clean water.

What happened in Texas and across the South during the storm -- and is still happening in its aftermath -- is one facet of a national crisis of race and democracy, one that has been amplified in recent decades by economic and public policies that have greatly enhanced the power and wealth of the few at the expense of the many. Republicans led the charge for the privatization of public utilities and the evisceration of labor unions and social welfare programs during the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s , which impacted Texas by leading to the deregulation of the energy grid . Many Democrats also embraced that era's ""greed is good"" ethos (a phrase popularized by Michael Douglas' Oscar-winning performance as the amoral venture capitalist Gordon Gekko in the 1987 movie ""Wall Street"").

The conservative free-market ideology that led to the deregulation of Texas utilities has been catastrophic on racially segregated and economically impoverished communities. Structured to operate without federal safeguards that might have prevented last month's disaster, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), represents a profound failure of political leadership and moral imagination.

Texas' failure is also reflective of our larger racial and political divides. Members of the Black communities in Houston, some still not recovered from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey, stood in long lines seeking food, water, and other resources a week after the winter storm. Predominantly Black and Latinx low-income communities were especially vulnerable to freezing temperatures since they tend to live in older homes and apartments hit hardest by power outages that wrought havoc on neighborhoods with decaying infrastructure.

The split-screen nature of American democracy means that lying politicians often try to impose an alternate reality in service to their own power. This could be seen at the height of the crisis, with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott attacking the Green New Deal as a rhetorical sleight of hand intended to deflect from his failed leadership. Abbott's false claims that the winter storm ""showed how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal"" for America reflects the Orwellian nature of American politics. Since less than 13% of the energy grid is powered by wind and solar energy, Abbott's naked effort to deflect blame for the disaster was as laughable as it was appalling. The failure of political leadership and moral imagination of the Texas governor is boundless. From prematurely announcing the end of a statewide mask mandate -- while residents in major cities still struggle to get vaccinated -- to the incompetent approach to a historic winter storm, the Lone Star state has become a national embarrassment.

When states like Texas turn public utilities into financial markets that can exploit the nation's collective resources for private interests, we all lose, especially Black and brown folks.

The reverse migration of Black folks to the South makes this a particularly important policy and political issue. Climate change, like all the challenges facing the nation and world, has a racially disparate face . Communities lacking political and economic resources will in all likelihood consistently suffer the most catastrophic impact of the kind of regional failure we witnessed during the third week in February.

After the Black Lives Matter protests so widespread in 2020 sparked a wave of conversation and engagement with anti-racism, it's crucial to say: Centering racial justice in the fight against climate change is perhaps among the most important policy imperatives in the quest for Black citizenship and dignity.

Sen. Ted Cruz's now-infamous escape to Cancun amid the state's crisis, while Beto O'Rourke and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised millions to help those in need, offers a striking juxtaposition of the twin realities of this moment. Cruz's rhetoric helped embolden the White supremacist assault on the nation's capital even as he failed the minimum test of leadership at home by abandoning his constituents in a time of crisis.

AOC's advocacy of a ""Green New Deal"" that would center poor, working-class, Black and brown communities as part of an ambitious effort to reverse climate change, end income inequality and confront systemic racism continues to be wrongly portrayed as a radical anti-American agenda by the right -- even as once in a century storms continue to damage local, regional, and national infrastructure with unnerving frequency.

National discussion surrounding ending systemic racism in government, politics, and corporate America begins by confronting racism's structural impact on already vulnerable communities. Blacks, Latinx, and poor communities of color continue to bear the brunt of environmental and political storms that cast a spotlight on American democracy's tragic underbelly. Now, more than ever, America needs infrastructure and climate change policies that address structural racism and inequality by centering racial and economic justice.","(CNN) The historic winter storm that crippled Texas during the third week of February spotlighted the Lone Star State's pervasive history of structural racism.

85,"Feb 22, 2021",Fire Engineering,Water Woes Linger in MS and LA After Freeze,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Rising temperatures have melted the snow and ice in Mississippi and Louisiana, but tens of thousands of people still had little or no water service Monday, some waiting a week for restoration since the outages began during an extended freeze.

A City Council member in Jackson, Mississippi, said Monday that it’s time for the city to seek state and federal help.

“This is an institutional failure,” said De’Keither Stamps, who is also a state representative. He said he spent about $5,000 to install a tank on his truck so could distribute water to homebound residents.

Stamps told The Associated Press that he visited a 70-year-old woman last week without heat or water who hadn’t left her bed in two days.

“This really broke the backs of a lot of communities,” he said of the storm. “We need door-to-door check-ins with our elderly.”

Jackson is under boil-water advisory, and city workers are delivering drinking water to older and homebound residents. Water for flushing toilets was available for pickup at two local schools, and people waited in long lines Monday to fill buckets and bowls.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has supplied 131,000 bottles of water to people statewide and is working to determine if the state has met its $4.5 million damages threshold to request a federal disaster declaration.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he has had trouble reaching Gov. Tate Reeves. The Democratic mayor said he has tried calling the Republican governor’s personal number without getting a response. Lumumba said he usually communicates with Reeves’ chief of staff, who left the state for a family emergency.

Reeves spokeswoman Bailey Martin said the governor has no unanswered calls from the mayor.

“This is false,” Martin said. “The governor has been leading the state’s response to this crisis, and he was the one who directed that water be delivered to Jackson residents via his agency, MEMA. We have been in consistent contact with the mayor’s office and other local leaders.”

On Monday, Jackson’s Public Works Director Charles Williams said it could be the end of the week before water returns for all 161,000 residents as crews scramble to repair broken pipes.

“We are doing everything we can to get it hopefully quicker than that,” Williams said.

Williams said the water shortage occurred after frigid temperatures iced equipment and caused water lines to burst. Officials say the city’s aging water system is not built for subfreezing temperatures.

Jackson has struggled to find money for improvements.

Mississippi has a 7% sales tax on many items. With permission of the Legislature, Jackson had a local election in January 2014 to add an extra 1% sales tax in the city to improve or replace aging infrastructure, including streets riddled with pot holes and pipes that are decades old and have a history of breaking after cold weather.

Voters overwhelmingly approved the tax, which was projected to generate about $15 million a year. That is only a fraction of what is needed, though. Jackson officials said in 2014 that fixing all the city’s infrastructure problems would cost about $2 billion.

Sheila Lewis, a parent of a 19-year-old student at Jackson State University, said her son has been without water for six days on campus. The campus has been shut down during the crisis.

“We just didn’t expect the university to be out for so long,” said Lewis, who lives in a Houston suburb.

Louisiana has faced similar challenges. About 82,000 people in Louisiana lacked access to water by Monday, according to the state health department, and hundreds of thousands of people around the state were advised to boil their water before using it.

In Shreveport, Louisiana’s third-largest city, about 8,000 residential and business customers still waited for their water connection to return, according to Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins. He said Louisiana’s difficulties from the winter weather have been lost amid the problems in Texas.

“Everybody’s eyes are on Texas,” Perkins said in an interview Monday. “Nobody even knows what’s going on here. They don’t even know the damage.”

He added: “Louisiana has been treated very much like a stepchild in this crisis.”

Perkins estimated full water restoration would be complete in his northwestern Louisiana city by Tuesday, a full eight days after outages began.

But even that won’t end the water woes in Shreveport. Perkins said once water is completely restored, customers will remain under a boil advisory until Thursday or Friday, because testing will need to be completed ensuring water is safe to drink. Meanwhile, water has been trucked to hospitals and distributed to residents.

“We’ve even had our fire trucks go out and pump water into the hospitals,” Perkins said.

Families running low on supplies have found Shreveport area grocery store shelves stripped of items, with delivery trucks unable to reach the region until roads cleared.

“It’s still rough on a lot of families,” Perkins said. “Just about every grocery store in the city doesn’t have milk, water, bread, any of those types of essentials.”

More than 15,000 customers remained without power Monday in Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.us, which trackers outages nationwide. Most of the outages were in the central and southwest parts of the state.

In Louisiana, fewer than 4,000 customers remained without power.

86,"Apr 7, 2021",WLBT,Senator says Jackson has to spend money on water system before getting more help from state,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - If Jackson wants the state’s help in repairing its water system, it will have to help itself first, so says District 26 Sen. John Horhn.

During the 2021 session, the city asked lawmakers for more than $100 million to help fund emergency repairs.

The request was made amid the city’s winter water crisis, which left tens of thousands of residents across Jackson without water for weeks.

The request included nearly $47 million to make upgrades at the city’s water treatment plans and $60 million to build additional storage tanks to increase capacity in underserved areas.

That $60 million request was additionally reduced to around $15 million.

However, by the end of the session, neither request had been approved, with the legislature allocating the city just $3 million out of the state’s capital expenditures fund.

Horhn said part of the reason is that Jackson is already set to receive tens of millions of dollars in funding from the American Recovery Plan.

Mississippi state Sen. John Horhn is shaken up but thankful for his life after he was robbed at gunpoint.

It also is going to likely receive millions more in emergency assistance once the state’s request for disaster assistance is approved by the president.

As part of ARP, Jackson is slated to receive $47 million in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds.

“The city gave us a $47 million request, yet they’re getting $47 million from HUD,” he said. “They could use the money they’re getting from that to make the repairs.

“Beyond that, what is Hinds County going to dedicate to that effort?”

The county is expected to get another $45 million in ARP funding. District One Supervisor Robert Graham said the board had not decided how it would spend its allocation.

“The first thing we have to do is get it,” he said. “We’ll get half of it (upfront) and the other half will come in 12 months.”

The city and the county are expected to receive the first half of their funding in the next 30 or so days, Horhn said.

Meanwhile, the senator said that as soon as the state’s disaster declaration is approved, Jackson will be able to apply for grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Treasury and other agencies.

The state recently received a time extension to submit its request for a major disaster declaration due to the February 11-19 winter storms. Two storms ripped across the state that month, causing widespread damage, including at Jackson’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) initially had until March 21 to submit its request but now has until April 16 to submit the request, according to a MEMA news release.

“There may be between $100 million and $200 million they could access from the federal government with the declaration,” Horhn explained. “It’s important the city aggressively goes after those discretionary funds.”

Also on the federal level, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) has authored legislation that would provide Jackson with at least $72 million in additional federal funds through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program and another $25 million from the federal Economic Development Administration’s Economic Adjustment Assistance grants program.

That bill has been referred to a Senate committee, but no action has been taken.

Jennifer Granholm, D-Mich., to be Secretary of Energy, Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP) (Graeme Jennings | AP)

Horhn was quick to say the state is not closing the door on Jackson but is rather requiring city leaders to pay it forward.

“The feeling in the legislature is, if you’re not trying to help yourself, why should I help you?” he said.

He points to the fact that lawmakers are likely going to set aside a portion of the $1.8 billion in relief funding it is expected to receive from ARP to the city.

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann also said he wanted to use $166 million in capital project funds from the federal government to establish a “support fund for every community affected by the ice storm.”

Horhn said state leaders also felt they had time to address the city’s water crisis, in part, because it will take time for Jackson to expend the initial $47 million it’s receiving.

“Let’s say the city dedicates $30 million of the $47 million to this crisis. And let’s say Hinds County gives another $20 million,” he said. “That’s $50 million to get cranked up.”

Add that to the $3 million from the state, “that’s $53 million the city will have a hard time spending,” Horhn said.

Lawmakers also want to see more details on how the city would use any allocation. He pointed to the fact that the city council asked for $60 million to install new water tanks in south and west Jackson, but then reduced that amount to $15 million.

“What they need to do is put in place a plan of action – what they will spend the money on and when,” Horhn said. “They won’t throw a boatload of money at the city without a plan in place.”

87,"Feb 25, 2021",WLBT,WLBT granted exclusive tour of O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - On Thursday, 3 On Your Side was given an exclusive tour of ground zero for Jackson’s winter water crisis – the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

Public Works Director Charles Williams agreed to the tour to help the public better understand how the recent winter storms caused interruptions in water service for homes and businesses across the city.

The tour came more than a week into the crisis, and as half of the 43,000 customers served by Curtis were still experiencing low or no water pressure.

“We wanted you to get a feel for what it takes to run a water treatment facility. It’s not easy,” Williams said. “It takes a lot of manual resources, as far as personnel. It also takes a lot of equipment to run a plant.

“All of (the equipment) has to be operational at all times to get water to our citizens ... safe water to our citizens.”

Early last week, a winter storm ripped across Mississippi, bringing with it freezing rain, sleet, snow, and sub-freezing temperatures. The weather wreaked havoc on the plant, causing several major pieces of equipment to stop working. A second storm came through in the middle of the week.

The brunt of the wintry weather was felt at the plant’s water intake area.

Curtis is located on a couple of acres located off of Lake Harbour Drive in Ridgeland.

It pumps in water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which is then filtered through large “water screens,” and diverted to a conventional settling tank.

Pumps at the O.B. Curtis malfunctioned following the winter storm, contributing to the city's water crisis. (WLBT)

The storm caused surface water temperatures at the reservoir to fall to 48 degrees. That surface temperature, coupled with the sub-freezing outside temperatures, led to the water screens freezing up, Williams said.

“Those froze and we couldn’t bring water in,” he said. “When the water gets to 48 degrees and the temperature outside is below 32 it’s a bad combination.”

Plant workers discovered the problem the Saturday following the storms.

“We got the screens back working and then we had an issue with the raw water pumps,” he said.

Raw water pumps bring in water directly from the reservoir, which is then filtered through the water screens and sent to the 10-million-gallon-capacity conventional basin, where it is allowed to settle.

From there, the water is chemically treated before being sent out into the city’s water distribution system.

Water is allowed to settle at the Curtis plant's coventional basin, before it is chemically treated. (WLBT)

The conventional method is one of two ways the plant treats water.

In addition to the conventional method, it also treats water through a membrane system, where raw water is brought in from the reservoir, diverted past the conventional basin, and pushed through membrane filters.

Public Works Director Charles Williams expands the Curtis plant's membrane filtration unit. (WLBT)

Curtis was constructed in the late 1980′s or early 1990′s and was expanded in 1997, Williams said. Today, it has the capacity to treat about 50 million gallons of water a day.

During the height of the crisis, water production at the facility fell to about 20 million gallons a day.

With the drop in production, pressure in the distribution system fell off. As a result, customers across the city lost water pressure. Pressure at Curtis must stay at around 90 pounds per square inch to ensure that water is pushed out throughout the city’s distribution system.

As of Thursday night, PSI at Curtis was still between 78 and 80, Williams said.

Treatment efforts were also hampered because two ultraviolet filters had gone down prior to the storm. Contractors were unable to come out and make repairs because of icy conditions.

“We were able to get them fixed internally,” he said. “That limited our ability to get water out.”

As the city addresses problems at the plant, it also is turning its attention to water main breaks.

As the pressure in the system is restored, the city expects water lines in the distribution system to rupture, something that could cause PSI again to drop.

Public works also will be looking at what, if anything, could have been done differently to prevent the crisis.

“That is something we’re going to have to evaluate,” he said. “Once we get everything restored, we need to lay everything on the table and have a thorough discussion about this particular event, what we learned from it, everything that went wrong, and what are some strategies we can put in place to prevent it from at least minimally happening again.”

Jackson is getting millions of dollars from the state to help fix its water system. After a lot of debate, the Mississippi Legislature approved $3 million, much less than the $47 million the mayor wanted.February’s water crisis crippled one of Jackson’s water treatment plants and left much of the city without running water for a month. After that unprecedented infrastructure failure, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba sent a letter to state and federal leaders asking for $47 million to pay for overdue repairs. The Republican-controlled legislature approved only $3 million to pay for repairs to the Fewell Water Plant at the Waterworks curve on I-55.“The $3 million that we received (Thursday) is nowhere near what we want, but it’s a start. Three-million-dollars is better than $0,” said State Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson.None of that money can be spent on the O.B. Curtis plant, which was a source of the initial water system shut down.“They came with a lot of rounded numbers, like, ‘We need $1 million. We need $2 million.’ So, we gave them $3 million to fix up the water plant, or at least get started on that,” said Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann.The legislature also approved a bill to help Jackson fix water billing problems. Sometimes customers go months without getting a water bill, and when they do, they may be charged thousands of dollars.“To allow the city to resolve all those disputed and delinquent claims, that’s going to clean up the books,” said Sen. David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson.Blount said he’s hopeful Gov. Tate Reeves will sign the bill. The governor vetoed similar legislation last year.“At the very beginning of these negotiations, I sat down with the governor’s staff person and we went to this bill again and again, line by line, because our intention was to help Jackson and get him a bill that he can agree to,” Blount said.“I’m confident this bill is going to give us some bonding capacity, so we will be able to make sure that our water treatment plants and other things are taken care of,” Bell said.Both bills approved by the legislature will have to be signed by the governor.Jackson is expected to receive $44 million under the new federal American Rescue Plan and they could get more federal dollars through the state to upgrade infrastructure, according to state leaders.","BUT THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE APPROVED ONLY $3 MILLION TO PAY FOR REPAIRS TO THE FEWELL WATER PLANT AT THE WATERWORKS CURVE ON I-55.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is walking back statements he made alleging state-owned properties in Jackson were not paying for water.

Lumumba made the comments to the New York Times and in at least one press conference locally amid the city's water crisis in an apparent effort to show the city doesn't receive its fair share of revenue from the state.

Lumumba said he sent a retraction to the Times after an unnamed official in his administration pointed out the error. The correction came about a week after the March 12 article was published, according to the Times.

Lumumba first told the paper the city “provides water for the state of Mississippi, but we don’t get paid for the water we provide to them. If we simply charged the state like any other customer, we’d be in a lot better position.”

When asked to clarify on Monday, the mayor's office released a statement.

“It has come to my attention that I have misspoken with regard to the state of Mississippi paying for water within the city of Jackson,” Lumumba said. “The state does in fact pay for its water. I stand corrected.”

Water billing plan: Plan to overhaul Jackson's water billing system two months away, consultant says

The correction comes after reports surfaced that showed state-owned properties were indeed paying their water bills and have been for years.

Jackson Jambalaya first broke the news and revealed through public record requests that several properties — including the Capitol Complex, Department of Agriculture & Commerce, PERS, and the Health Department — have paid several hundred thousand dollars in water bills in just this fiscal year alone.

The comments have generated their own controversy between the mayor and Gov. Tate Reeves. When asked Monday, Reeves blasted the mayor for the claims.

""Either that was a complete lie or he was informed wrong about what the state pays,"" Reeves said. ""My understanding is the state has spent well in excess of half a million dollars on water alone.""

Reeves also pointed to the city's issues with its water billing system, where thousands of water customers still do not receive a bill. That has resulted in a shortfall of millions of dollars of revenue every year for the city.

The Clarion Ledger has also submitted public records requests for billing information from state-owned properties. It is also examining whether those properties pay property taxes. Lumumba — in his correction — said the state does not pay taxes nor a payment in lieu of taxes. It also does not pay for police and fire services, he said.

The correction comes as Lumumba and other city officials are attempting to secure $47 million in funding from the state to help repair its deficient infrastructure. Consecutive days of freezing temperatures led to a historic shutdown of the water's treatment plants, leading to widespread water shortages and outages, and resulting in a citywide boil-water notice that lasted close to a month.

""That's one of the unfortunate things when we find ourselves in what we all agree is a crisis with Jackson's water system,"" Reeves continued. ""There are enough challenges out there where we all need to work together that nobody needs to go out there and lie and make it seem worse than it really is.""

A consultant with the city said it will take about two months before a comprehensive plan to overhaul Jackson's troubled water billing system will be ready for review.

Mike Secor updated council members on Monday of progress analyzing Jackson's water and sewer billing system, as well as a look at reorganizing the city's Water/Sewer Business Administration.

He said a final report on both will be ready in approximately eight weeks.

The plan will encompass Jackson's longstanding issues with getting water bills out to customers or reliably trusting its water meter system.

It also comes as a backdrop to the city's worst water infrastructure crisis in recent memory, which has put Jackson's water woes back in public view.

""People want to know what the city is doing to stabilize its water system,"" Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay said after the meeting. ""Finally, there's some end in sight.""

One of the problems with the current system is that the city’s meters do not transmit information in a reliable manner, meaning water meter usage is difficult to track.

The new system would have automated meters that can collect and store water billing information remotely. It will also allow customers to review and pay their bill via cellphone, as well as start or transfer service online.

For years, Jackson has lost out on millions in dollars of revenue from water collections due to widespread billing issues. The city should see about $7 million a month in water revenue, said Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay. Instead, it collects about half that.

""And that's been the case for years,"" Lindsay said.

The plan announcement comes almost 10 years after the city signed its $89 million contract with Siemens Industry Inc. and several Jackson subcontractors to overhaul the billing system. That contract guaranteed savings but resulted in widespread issues with the system that persist.

It was revealed in 2018 that nearly one-third of all water customers weren't getting a bill.

""We want to make sure we have the most efficient operation, more people power, more resources and understand where our strengths or weaknesses are,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

100,"Mar 22, 2021",,"One Month Later, Boil Water Advisory Lifted for Jackson, Mississippi Residents","After 30 days of boiling their water to get rid of contaminants and sometimes no water at all, Jackson residents are finally able to drink the water from the tap after officials lifted a boil water advisory put in place in mid-February when a deep freeze wreaked havoc on their water infrastructure.

The city’s 43,000 surface water connections were released Wednesday from the boil advisory put in place on Feb. 16. A boil notice had previously been lifted for the city’s 16,000 well water connections on March 10.

After officials said cold weather froze equipment at the city’s water treatment plant, thousands of water customers went weeks with low pressure or no pressure at all, collecting water in buckets from distribution sites throughout the city to flush toilets and clean themselves. National Guard members were called in to help distribute water. Volunteers loaded tanks of water on trucks to deliver to apartment complexes housing seniors and those without transportation.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said the crisis has been caused in part by decades of neglect of aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson’s water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor affecting the city’s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base because of “white flight.” Jackson’s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize the water system and other infrastructure related to sewer and roads.

The Democratic mayor wrote a letter to Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and other officials to request $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system. Since then, the mayor and other city leaders have begun meeting with legislative leaders to discuss options.

102,1 month ago,Mississippi Today,Task of redrawing U.S. House districts not as daunting as in 2000,"In 2001, House Speaker Tim Ford of Baldwyn supported the plan of fellow Democrats to place much of suburban Jackson in a congressional district with northeast Mississippi.

Explaining the congressional redistricting effort featuring the Tupelo to Jackson district, Ford off-handedly dubbed it “the tornado plan” because of the way it looked on the map. Ford’s intent was not to sabotage the plan, and most likely opposition to the plan would have been intense regardless of what it was called, but the “tornado” moniker stuck and not in a good way.

Indeed, the moniker helped galvanize opposition.

The political landscape of the state was much different in 2001, though in hindsight the writing already was on the wall portending the rise of the Republican Party and fall of the Democratic Party.

As a result of the 2000 Census, Mississippi’s number of U.S. House seats was reduced from five to four — not because the state lost population but because it did not grow as much as other states. Legislators faced the difficult task of redrawing the districts, knowing they would be forced to pit two incumbent U.S. House members against each other.

Legislators could not complete the task after the 2000 Census. And legislators also failed to draw congressional districts based on the population shifts found by the 2010 Census. In both 2000 and 2010, the federal judiciary ended up drawing the districts.

Now, 10 years later, legislators again face the task of redrawing House districts. The preliminary census data was released last month. Both Senate Pro Tem Dean Kirby, R-Pearl, and Rep. Jim Beckett, R-Bruce, who are heading up their chambers’ redistricting efforts, have said they intend for the Legislature, not the courts, to redraw the congressional districts — early in the 2022 session.

They will not have much time. The qualifying deadline for candidates to run for the U.S. House is March 1.

Like in 2000 and 2010, Mississippi will have four U.S. House members. The state is not losing a U.S. House seat even though it was one of only three states to lose population, according to early census data.

In 2000, Mississippi’s five U.S. House members were Democrats Gene Taylor of the 5th District on the Gulf Coast; Ronnie Shows of the 4th District, which stretched from Jackson into southwest Mississippi; Bennie Thompson of the 2nd District, who was the state’s sole African American member representing most of the Delta; and Republicans Roger Wicker of the 1st District in north Mississippi; and Chip Pickering of the 3rd District, which included parts of the Jackson suburbs and much of east Mississippi.

The consensus was that Pickering and Shows would be thrown into the same district — in part because they had less experience than some of the other members and in part for the sake of the compactness of the districts.

Democrats, who controlled both the state House and Senate in the form of Speaker Ford and Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck, reasoned that it made sense to move the Republicans in high voter turnout Jackson suburbs in Madison and Rankin counties from Pickering to Wicker.

Democrats reasoned that the tornado plan would result in the re-election of Thompson and Taylor for their side and put the incumbents Shows and Pickering in a toss-up district. On the other hand, people from northeast Mississippi feared the tornado plan could make Wicker, a Tupelo resident, vulnerable to a Republican from the Jackson suburbs.

At any rate, Tuck, though a Democrat, would not go for the tornado plan.

The result was a November special session where the two redistricting chairs, Rep. Tommy Reynolds and Sen. Hob Bryan, essentially did nothing other than call meetings where they rejected each other’s offers on behalf of their leadership and then regaled those in attendance with their vast knowledge of literature, ranging from Shakespeare to Tennessee Williams to Faulkner to the Bible.

After seven days, the House leadership opted to end the special session. The Senate stayed in session, knowing that if one chamber refused to go home the other would be forced to return.

But then Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, Mississippi’s last Democratic governor, stepped in to conclude the session based on a constitutional clause that said the governor could end the session if the two chambers could not agree.

With the Legislature not able to complete its task, the courts, both on the state and federal levels, got involved in a complex process that involved multiple high profile attorneys. The end result was a plan that looked nothing like a tornado where Pickering easily defeated Shows.

In 2003, Tuck, facing anger from Democrats, ran and won re-election as a Republican. In 2010, Taylor lost to Republican Steven Palazzo, leaving the Democrats with one U.S. House member: Thompson.

The upcoming effort to redistrict the House is not expected to result in such dramatic changes.

103,"Mar 25, 2021",WJTV,12 News Investigates: Former Mayor Danks on Jackson’s water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – 12 News spoke with former Jackson Mayor Dale Danks Jr. about the city’s water infrastructure. He held the position from 1977 to 1989.

Danks said when he was with sanitation, he wanted to be the mayor of the city, and he succeeded. When he became mayor, the city was expanding.

“You get a great deal of experience that helps you meet those challenges. It took a lot of money and a lot of time to provide water and sewage to the South Jackson area. That’s the area that was annexed right after I went in,” he stated.

You don’t want to ignore people and not address problems or challenges. It makes or breaks the image of the City of Jackson.”

104,"Mar 13, 2021",WLBT,Congressman Thompson offers solutions to help with Jackson’s water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson has been facing a water crisis for nearly a month, but U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson said there are some solutions to help the city bounce back.

He said there’s a short term solution.

“Short term, FEMA,” said Thompson. “Now that we have the paperwork submitted requesting that disaster declaration, I anticipate in very short order that President Biden will make that disaster declaration available for Hinds County and 32 other counties that the request has gone in.”

Then there’s a long term solution.

In the next few weeks, lawmakers in Washington will be voting on an infrastructure package.

“In those packages, will be additional monies for communities like Jackson, to improve water, sewer, as well as streets and other infrastructure challenges that they might have,” said Thompson.

The longtime lawmaker said the state and Capital City will also receive relief funds from the American Rescue Plan to help them recover.

Also included in the $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package is money to provide access to the COVID-19 vaccine, especially for African-Americans throughout the state.

The congressman said many people have raised concerns about not having transportation to get the shot, or their city doesn’t have sites available.

Now, he’s hoping that will change.

“This money that we put in the COVID relief package will pay 100 percent of the cost of doing anything as it relates to COVID,” the lawmaker explained. “If you have to hire buses to take people to get a shot, we’ll reimburse them. If you have to have five sites in an area, if those sites are providing shots for individuals, we’ll pay for the cost. There’s no excuse now for states or municipalities not to have sites available.”

Though he’s happy about the American Rescue Plan being passed and signed, Thompson said there’s one issue that still lingers regarding that legislation.

“I was just kind of bothered that no other member of our delegation voted for it,” he expressed.

Still, Thompson said he believes the plan will bring some much needed relief to many cities in the state who are struggling.

“I just thought anytime people can alleviate the pain and suffering in your community then that’s a good thing,” said Thompson. “That’s what America’s all about, helping people in their time of need.”

106,"Mar 3, 2021",WLBT,Jackson restaurant owner asking for help as locations suffer from lack of water,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - One of Jackson’s biggest cheerleaders is taking a rare stance, asking people to help his business in light of the city’s water crisis.

The news comes even as an anonymous patron makes a $10,000 purchase in gift cards from the establishments.

Jeff Good, co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, outlined his restaurant’s struggles on Facebook Wednesday morning.

“This is day 15 of no water at Broad Street Bakery & Cafe ... We have been working directly with the city of Jackson ... they are doing all they can but this was truly a catastrophic failure of equipment and the recovery period will drag out until the entire web of water lines and water towers (is) repressurized,” he wrote.

Another one of his restaurants, Sal & Mookie’s New York Pizza and Ice Cream Joint, on Taylor Street, opened on a limited basis earlier this week after being closed for more than 10 days with no water.

Good said he had avoided asking for help until now, saying that in light of the circumstances, “perhaps it is time to just go ahead and surrender and say ‘your help would be wonderful.’”

Meanwhile, Good is asking patrons to come back to his restaurants when they do reopen.

“We know your patterns of breakfast eating, coffee and pastry pick up, lunch ordering, afternoon snacking and dinner pick up have changed since we shuttered,” he wrote. “Habits are formed over time, through repetition and consistency. I fear that some of you may be building a new dining habit since we are not available.

“Please, please return. When we reopen, we will need you more than ever.”

Not all the news is bad for Good, though, with the restaurateur taking time on social media to thank a patron who purchased $10,000 in gift cards at Bravo! Italian Restaurant, his third Jackson location.

“We are all speechless,” he wrote. “Thank you for loving us ... supporting us ... caring for us.”

Jackson has been struggling to restore water for weeks after winter storms crippled production at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

The plant, which is located in Ridgeland, brings in water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which it treats and sends out into the system.

However, the freezing temperatures brought in with the storms caused equipment there to freeze and water production to be cut by about half.

Typically, the plant can treat around 50 million gallons of water per day. However, during the storm, production fell to around 27 million gallons, Public Works Director Charles Williams said previously.

As a result of the decrease, the city’s reserve water tanks ran dry, water pressure fell and thousands of customers ended up with no water.

Williams said the city has been working to rebuild pressure in the system and explained that it needed to be around 90 PSI at the Curtis plant for water to be restored across the capital city.

However, pressure has yet to reach that point and has hovered in the mid-80s, and efforts to fully restore pressure have been met with several setbacks.

Among them, the city has experienced a number of water main breaks as the pressure in the system comes back up.

In all, about 80 breaks have been reported, of which 58 have been repaired.

Another setback occurred on Wednesday, March 3, when a mechanical issue was reported at one of the Curtis plant’s raw water screens, forcing the city to cut production so the issue could be fixed.

The raw water screens filter water being brought into the plant from the Ross Barnett Reservoir.

To make repairs, the city had to shut down production on the plant’s conventional treatment side, causing pressure there to fall to around 60 PSI.

Curtis treats water in two ways: the conventional method and the membrane method.

Water is allowed to settle at the Curtis plant's coventional basin, before it is chemically treated. (WLBT)

On the conventional side, water is pumped in directly from the reservoir and allowed to settle in a large basin before being chemically treated. On the membrane side, water is diverted past the conventional basin and pushed through membrane filters before being treated.

Williams hopes to have the problem fixed today. “We’re addressing that now. We’re trying to get it back up as quick as possible.”

More clean water and supplies will be coming to the Jackson area Wednesday to help those who were affected by the winter storms that swept through Mississippi in mid-February.

Members of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, based in Stonecrest, Georgia, will give out bottled water, household cleaning supplies and non-perishable food at the Pearl Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, located at 2615 Robinson St. in Jackson, beginning at 4 p.m.

The church has previously helped other areas of the country during disasters such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and the New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina.

They had recently been providing supplies to people in Texas who were also affected by the winter storms, but were later contacted by Jackson residents to ask for help.

""Jackson wasn't even on our radar,"" said Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of the church. ""We had no idea this was happening.""

Bryant said he reached out to former Jackson mayor Tony Yarber to learn more about what was happening in the city and began collecting donations soon after.

""It was dizzying to me how this wasn't a bigger news story,"" Bryant said.

Bryant said he hasn't heard of an event like this happening so close to home before, but is glad his church can offer help to those still in need nearly three weeks later.

108,"Mar 5, 2021",News 1130,Official: End in sight for Jackson residents without water,"JACKSON, Miss. — Crews continued working Friday to restore water to thousands of customers in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, where some taps have been completely dry for nearly three weeks.

“A lot of our residents have just had to endure this water outage, and it’s disheartening that it’s gone on this long,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday during a news conference. “But I see the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Williams said he hopes to see service restored to most customers in Jackson by the end of the weekend.

The water shortage in Jackson occurred after a winter storm passed through the region three weeks ago, freezing machinery at the water treatment plant. When it began to thaw, dozens of water mains broke.

The outage left people in the majority-Black city, where close to 30% of 160,000 residents live in poverty, scrambling to find water to flush toilets, bathe and drink. The National Guard was called in to assist at water distribution sites, where people waited for hours in lines of vehicles to fill buckets and bowls to fill with water.

A key focus to recovery has been filling the system’s water tanks. Williams said earlier in the week that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into the treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

Williams said Thursday he is feeling encouraged. It was “a good day” for the city’s water system, he said.

“Water is flowing through the system, and we are getting our tanks filled,” he said.

Williams said as the city’s tanks continue to fill, the city can start sampling the water to see about lifting the boil water notice, which has been in effect since Feb. 16.

By the end of the weekend, most customers will have service returned, with the exception of a few “isolated areas” — mostly areas impacted by water main breaks, he said. City workers patched around 70 water main breaks during the last three weeks, according to a news release.

“We are very sorry for this traumatic experience for our residents throughout this particular time and understand that this has been very difficult on everyone,” Williams said.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said that the water crisis has been caused in part because of decades of neglect regarding the city’s aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson’s water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor impacting the city’s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base due to white flight. Jackson’s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools. The city was 60% white in 1970, according to U.S. census data. In 2021, it is more than 80% Black.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

On Wednesday, Lumumba penned a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asking for $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system.

“These improvements are critical to our efforts to ensure that our residents and businesses are not deprived of clean water again,” he wrote.

112,"Apr 12, 2021",Voice of America,Las Vegas Pushes to Become First City to Ban Ornamental Grass,"LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - A desert city built on a reputation for excess and indulgence wants to become a model for restraint and conservation with a first-in-the-nation policy banning grass that nobody walks on.

Las Vegas-area water officials have spent two decades trying to get people to replace thirsty greenery with desert plants, and now they’re asking the Nevada Legislature to outlaw roughly 40% of the turf that’s left.

The Southern Nevada Water Authority estimates there are almost 8 square miles (21 square kilometers) of “nonfunctional turf” in the metro area — grass that no one ever walks on or otherwise uses in street medians, housing developments and office parks.

They say this ornamental grass requires four times as much water as drought-tolerant landscaping like cactus and other succulents. By ripping it out, they estimate the region can reduce annual water consumption by roughly 15% and save about 14 gallons (53 liters) per person per day.

Las Vegas might be known for splashy displays like the Bellagio fountains on the neon-lit Strip, but officials say residents of bedroom communities and sprawling suburbs embrace conservation measures, including aggressive monitoring of sprinklers and leaky irrigation systems.

“The public perception outside of Las Vegas is certainly much different — and has been for a long time — than the water conservation ethic within the community,” said Colby Pellegrino, Southern Nevada Water Authority water resources director.

Sprinklers water grass near a street corner on April 9, 2021, in a neighborhood located in northwest Las Vegas.

California imposed a temporary ban on watering ornamental grass during last decade’s drought, but no state or major city has tried to phase out certain categories of grass permanently.

“The scale of this is pretty unprecedented in terms of a full ban on this nonfunctional turf,” said John Berggren, a water policy analyst at Western Resource Advocates.

The proposal is part of a turf war waged since at least 2003, when the water authority banned developers from planting green front yards in new subdivisions. It also offers owners of older properties the region’s most generous rebate policies to tear out sod — up to $3 per square foot.

Those efforts are slowing. The agency says the number of acres converted under its rebate program fell last year to six times less than what it was in 2008. Meanwhile, water consumption in southern Nevada has increased 9% since 2019.

Last year was among the driest in the region’s history, when Las Vegas went a record 240 days without measurable rainfall. And the future flow of the Colorado River, which accounts for 90% of southern Nevada’s water, is in question.

The waterway supplies Arizona, California, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, New Mexico, Wyoming and Mexico. As drought and climate change decrease what the river provides, the amount allocated to Arizona, California and Nevada is projected to be cut further.

Justin Jones, a Clark County commissioner who serves on the water authority’s board, doesn’t think ripping out ornamental turf will upend people’s lives.

“To be clear, we are not coming after your average homeowner’s backyard,” he said. But grass in the middle of a parkway, where no one walks: “That’s dumb.”

“The only people that ever set foot on grass that’s in the middle of a roadway system are people cutting the grass,” Jones said.

The agency has different regulations for yards and public parks. Based on satellite imaging, it believes banning ornamental grass will primarily affect common areas maintained by homeowner associations and commercial property owners.

Jones said the proposal has drawn resistance in some master-planned communities, but water officials say years of drought-awareness campaigns and policies like the rebates have cultivated a cultural change.

Southern Nevada Homebuilders’ Association lobbyist Matt Walker said consumer preferences have reached the point that potential homebuyers from wetter regions aren’t turned off from neighborhoods that have parks but no ornamental grass.

Conservation frees water, reduces per capita consumption and strengthens builders’ arguments that the desert can accommodate more growth, Walker said. “And the benefits are the ability to keep doing what we do, which is building homes.”

“We’ve really gotten a comfort level that buyers are very much willing to go along with responsible development practices when it comes to water use,” he added.

Other desert cities aren’t so sure. Salt Lake City has an ordinance that requires a certain amount of yard and median greenery. Phoenix, where some neighborhoods remain lush from flood irrigation, has never offered grass removal rebates.

Water officials elsewhere are loath to compare their policies to southern Nevada. Particularly in cities where water consumption per person is high, they say there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for a drier future.

Las Vegas, for example, mostly ignores toilets, showers and dishwashers because the water authority is able to treat and recycle indoor wastewater and let it flow through a natural wash into Lake Mead — the Colorado River reservoir behind Hoover Dam. It is filtered again for reuse.

A draconian anti-grass policy might not work in downtown Phoenix, said Cynthia Campbell, water resources adviser for the nation’s fifth-largest city. Trees and grass blunt public health dangers of “urban heat islands” — areas lacking green landscaping to offset heat through evaporative cooling.

Regional water officials understand future consumption will have to be reduced but fear the preparation and perception could backfire if the community doesn’t buy in.

“There comes a point when people’s demands start to harden,” Campbell said. “They’ll say, ‘This is the point of no return for me.’ For some people, it’s a pool. For some people, it’s grass.”

The Southern Nevada Water Authority isn’t sure the idea of banning grass will spread to other cities. But Pellegrino, the water resources chief, said other places will have to make changes.

“Particularly every community that relies on Colorado River water.”","They say this ornamental grass requires four times as much water as drought-tolerant landscaping like cactus and other succulents.

114,"Mar 25, 2021",WJTV,12 News Investigates: Former Mayor Yarber on Jackson’s water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – In 2017, Jackson was met with pipe problems. The city had to repair a 48 inch pipe in Northwest Jackson.

He said during his time as mayor from 2014 to 2017, there were troubles with not only the underground piping, but issues with the distribution systems at times, the plant itself and lead leaching. In 2017, he played a role in an opportunity with the state.

“They would become contributors to the city’s infrastructure through the Capitol Complex, a bill that was passed. So the city should be getting about $11 to $13 million per year of work being invested in the city based on that,” said Yarber.

He said fixing the infrastructure will take time because after years, the problems have exacerbated.

“There was no investment in the 1980s, the 1970s into infrastructure, and so what you see is the cascading effecting on the city’s leadership and the city’s coffers.”

In 2014 as mayor, Tony Yarber created an infrastructure plan and secured federal funding for State Street and West County Line Road projects.

He came to speak to the Jackson City Council, to thank them for considering an ordinance to rename a street after him.

The city is considering renaming Ellis Avenue to Bobby Rush Boulevard, in honor of the two-time Grammy winner.

“I never dreamed that I would have this honor from you guys, to name this street after me. I’ve been up for Grammy six times and won two of them,” he said.

Rush, who said he’s recorded 398 records, said he no longer tells his age, “I’m over 85 but not quite 90,” but did share several stories of the racism he and his family experienced in the Jim Crow South.

“I’m in tears because I remember three white guys, two riding a horse and one guy leading a horse, when my daddy was getting hay out of a barn as a black man. They asked my mom, ‘what are you doing with this n-word.? [And she said,] ‘that’s what I am too,’ he said. “She had to go into the store and prove she was a Black woman to save my daddy’s life.”

An ordinance to rename the street was introduced at the April 27 meeting. The ordinance is expected to be expedited through the approval process and will be amended to rename Ellis Avenue from Belvedere Drive to Woodrow Wilson Avenue.

City Attorney Monica Allen said before the ordinance can be passed, several steps have to be taken, including notifying businesses along the roadway of the potential change.

The council initially considered renaming a smaller stretch of Ellis after the legendary performer but was told by Planning Director Jordan Hillman that it would be less expensive to rename the entire street.

Council members had no qualms about following the planning director’s advice.

Ward Three Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who also suggested renaming the entire street after Rush, said he’s glad the city has its own Bluesman to represent it.

“We love B.B., he was always talking about Mississippi. But now we’ve got somebody to talk about Jackson and we’re proud of it,” he said. “I thank the president for coming up with the idea because a lot of people love you.”

The only thing between you and another round of COVID-19 relief is one House vote and President Joe Biden's signature. The House of Representatives is poised to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan on Wednesday with $1,400 checks, billions for vaccines and money to reopen schools. The Senate passed the bill over the weekend after a marathon session. Once the House has passed the legislation and Biden's signed it, stimulus checks will start to go out in a matter of weeks. Could the bill not pass? It's possible, but unlikely.

Where's Joe?: The latest batch of stimulus checks will look a little different from the two previous rounds. The president’s signature will be missing. “This is not about him,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “This is about the American people getting relief.”

Millions of people watched George Floyd take his last breath while pinned under Chauvin's knee. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest police killings of Black men like him, chanting his last words: ""I can't breathe."" Now, lawyers must find 12 people in and around Minneapolis who haven't made up their minds about what happened. In such a high-profile case, we expect that won't be easy.

Detailed data released this week by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services illustrates just how much the nation's hospitals have recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic's third wave. Although more than 1,500 Americans are dying of COVID-19 every day, the share of COVID-19 patients make up a decreasing share of hospital admissions around the country. The number of hospitals with more than half of patients infected with COVID-19 has dropped from 193 to 10 since early January. Intensive care units have become less strained as well.

There is a water crisis in Mississippi

Imagine having to lug gallons of water home from a distribution site — just to flush the toilet. Water pressure so low that it’s difficult to take a shower or wash dishes. And even if there were water flowing from the faucets, it wouldn't be safe to drink. That’s what thousands of people in Jackson, Mississippi, are facing nearly a month after a brutal winter storm passed through and knocked out water pressure. Officials said early this week that the pressure was being restored, but the situation there still isn’t resolved: The water in Jackson is unsafe to drink – and has been since a boil water notice was issued Feb. 16.

117,"Feb 25, 2021",Mississippi Today,"Winter storm prompts review of Mississippi’s electric, gas, water infrastructure","Mississippi’s public service commissioners announced on Wednesday that they are launching a comprehensive review of the state’s public utility infrastructure in response to the damages caused by last week’s winter storm.

The goal of the review, which will begin immediately, is to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure utility services across the state are reliable.

The commission, which regulates the state’s public utilities that offer electricity, water and gas, noted that the state’s electric and natural gas utilities performed well during the winter storm, but that regulators still need to guarantee systems are in place to avoid costly and damaging large-area outages — similar to what happened last week in Texas.

“While Mississippi utilities are accustomed to extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes, winter storms are much rarer,” the commission wrote in a press release. “The latest winter storm presented new challenges to Mississippi utilities that the commission feels must be addressed immediately and forthrightly.”

Last week’s historic winter storm wrecked public infrastructure and disrupted public services across the state. Hundreds of thousands of Mississippians lost power at some point during the winter storm, and residents in dozens of Mississippi cities and towns also went without water or had low water pressure. Thousands of residents across the cities of Jackson and Vicksburg still have no water service.

“It is our highest duty as commissioners to make sure that we not only solve problems but anticipate them ahead of time,” Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley said. “This latest winter storm has presented challenges that must be addressed in a formal and thorough manner. Mississippians deserve to have every assurance that the public and private power grid, water and other utility services will be there at all times. After all, the customers are the ones paying for it. Working families and small businesses are already financially struggling because of the pandemic, we must protect their pocketbooks along the way.”

121,1 month ago,Next City,"How Jackson, Mississippi’s New Comprehensive Plan Foregrounds Race","The last time the city of Jackson, Mississippi developed a comprehensive plan, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was graduating high school. (He’s now 38.) Lumumba became mayor in 2017 in an election that was said to represent a new era for Jackson and the South. In his campaigning, he stressed that solutions for the city’s crises — including economic inequality, budget cuts and crumbling infrastructure — shouldn’t come from the upper levels of government or policy advisors — but instead the very people who have long been marginalized by the political status quo.

It was under that belief his administration kicked off a new comprehensive planning process which in many ways has centered around Washington Addition, a predominantly Black neighborhood that faced significant city neglect but is undergoing new development due to its proximity to Jackson State University. More recently, this community engagement translated to the mayor’s response to the water crisis caused by February storms.

“Many of the groups that have participated in some way in our planning processes activated and provided mutual aid during the water crisis,” says Mayor Lumumba. “I would say that relationships became the forefront of the mutual aid process … that is something that Jackson, as a whole, not limited to city government by itself, seems to be extremely skilled at.”

Mayor Lumumba’s focus on Washington Addition predates the larger citywide comprehensive plan and essentially shaped that process to come. In many ways, this neighborhood — one of the first African American communities in Jackson — embodies struggles of predominantly Black communities across the country.

What became a working-class enclave intimately tied to the university was badly impacted by white flight from the city in the 1970s and 80s. “Like much of West Jackson, Washington Addition became, by the 1990s, an almost forgotten area,” according to a history of the neighborhood. By 2000, nearly one-quarter of all housing units were vacant. In 2002, the university formed the Jackson State Center for University Based Development to help spur revitalization efforts.

The Mayor’s office wanted a more active role in the relationship between Washington Addition and Jackson State University, especially as development interest increased. In 2019 the administration kicked off its first neighborhood planning process here. “It was an attempt to use existing staff, who carried multiple duties at the time, and attempting to do the first neighborhood plan in quite a number of years,” explains Jordan Rae Hillman, director of planning and development for the city.

With limited staff and infrastructure, the city’s planning team got creative. The city forged a partnership with the local Jim Hill High School to create the Jim Hill Neighborhood Planning Team. In February of 2019 the team, which included high school students, held a neighborhood survey outside a Family Dollar Store. Responses were used to develop neighborhood statistics on quality of life issues including housing, open space, transit, blight and healthy food access. The city also tracked property conditions, vacant land conditions and existing land use to create a GIS map.

“We actually didn’t come out of this with a written plan to date,” notes Hillman. “We came out of this with internal goals through supporting the neighborhood with our services better.” It also revealed that the planning team needed more capacity to continue the work. “The Washington Addition work really solidified we needed to resource build — we jumped in without the true resources to support it,” Hillman says.

Given years of government funding cuts, resource building looked as basic as replacing outdated computers, utilizing modern mapping and data software and hiring dedicated neighborhood planning staff. “We’ve prioritized it within our latest budget,” notes Mayor Lumumba.

In February, planners kicked off citywide comprehensive planning to get a big-picture look at existing resources and needs across the city. “We really had to engage with one another to identify what we want to build and what we want to see,” as Mayor Lumumba put it. Then the challenges hit: major flooding in early 2020, followed by COVID-19. February’s winter storms caused a five-week water crisis that was years in the making, due to infrastructure neglect and tax cutting by the Republican-led state government alongside a shrinking tax base exacerbated by white flight.

That crisis deepened the urgency to prioritize infrastructure in city planning, according to Mayor Lumumba. “The comprehensive plan is not a replacement for a capital improvement plan,” he notes. “The comprehensive plan will look at the systemic planning decisions and population decline that contributed to our infrastructure challenges over the past fifty years, and the policies developed will be focused on creating the population base and land use pattern that is needed to maximize the use of our existing infrastructure.”

The city navigated other challenges. It couldn’t replicate some of its successful engagement initiatives in Washington Addition, like partnering with local schools or conducting in-person neighborhood surveys, during COVID-19. Instead, the city partnered with the Central Mississippi Planning & Development District and the nonprofit One Voice to begin digital and telephone outreach, as well as some socially-distant gatherings. Mayor Lumumba also focused on the transition from neighborhood planning in Washington Addition to the rest of Jackson during his Just City Mayoral Fellowship with the Mayor’s Institute on City Design.

“What we have to realize is that engagement doesn’t stop with this process — it requires ongoing communication, an ongoing investment in what the community is saying they want and need,” Mayor Lumumba says. “So as we’re engaging the community about blight elimination, for example, we’re dealing with it in a strategic way that doesn’t just set the stage for gentrification.”

Indeed, one thing that will set this comprehensive plan apart from its predecessor is prioritizing how race and racism has deeply shaped the city. “We know we have a very racist history here,” Hillman says. “The level it worked into how our housing looks today is the story we are trying to tell, and then match our recommendations and interventions moving forward with how we reconcile that. We think it’s a really important conversation between the white and Black community in Jackson.”

An internal planning team is currently studying matters like redlining and discriminatory zoning in specific Jackson neighborhoods. Washington Addition, for example, was marketed as a “colored subdivision” when homes went on the market in the early 1900s.

The goal is to finish the comprehensive plan this year, which will identify neighborhood planning districts throughout the city. (While it will provide guidance on priorities to support economic and neighborhood stability and growth, it will not identify specific projects, the mayor says.) The team will then return its focus to Washington Addition to complete a plan that builds off all the city’s prior work.

When Mayor Lumumba thinks on the importance of this comprehensive planning for Jackson, he quotes Scripture: “People without a vision perish,” he says. “I believe that. I believe that without a true plan, we really have no idea where we’re going. And as you’re looking for people to make investments in your community, they need to see the overall mission of the community and where we’re headed.”

122,"Mar 3, 2021",WLBT,"Non-profit works to keep disabled people out of nursing homes, amid water crisis, pandemic","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - A non-profit that helps Mississippians with disabilities is working to keep members of this close-knit, vulnerable group out of assisted living facilities.

Created through federal legislation, the non-profit organization named LIFE of Mississippi has been helping people with disabilities since 1992.

“We don’t look at the dis in disability, we look at abilities,” said program management coordinator Margie Moore.

While Mississippi (and the nation) was still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, Jackson was slammed by February’s Winter storm, limiting the number one resource; water.

“Some of our members are without water in South Jackson and we’ve been supplying water and food and making sure they have everything they need,” Moore said.

Jackson is now in week three of this water crisis, which has made national headlines. Everyone is under a boil water advisory, several schools remain closed and many people are still without water.

But for someone who already lacks mobility, these difficult times are a nightmare.

“You don’t have to be a wheelchair user like myself, you could be visually impaired or just can’t get to the site and it’s a stress and a struggle,” Desmeon Thomas said, a LIFE of Mississippi member.

Thomas was the innocent victim of a robbery in 2002 and lost his mobility to walk. He said the crisis can remind a disabled person of the obvious.

“It makes you realize all over what your limitations are. It’s stressful and can even bring about depression,” Thomas added.

But Thomas refuses to give into isolation. He helps bring awareness to the challenges people with disabilities face and also encourages others to focus on their abilities.

“If they drop off a bucket of non-potable water, we can’t pick it up, but we can take time to scoop the water out,” Thomas said. “And I commend the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency because they are working with the city to come up with these kinds of solutions for our community.”

And LIFE of Mississipi says the ultimate goal is to keep members out of nursing homes.

“We work with anyone to keep you in your own home,” Margi Moore said.

During the height of the pandemic, most long-term care facilities averaged over 200 virus outbreaks.

Now, there’s an average of 61 COVID-19 outbreaks, but LIFE is staying focused on its goal.

“We want to keep our people COVID-free and independent, which also helps them to stay mentally healthy.”

LIFE has delivered hundreds of hot meals, built six wheelchair ramps, donated truckloads of necessities, hosted basic skills training, and distributed vital COVID-19 supplies, such as face shields.

If someone can’t cook for themselves, LIFE ensures they have meals delivered to their home. If someone is visually impaired, LIFE connects them to resources for the blind. And even if someone was recently injured or disabled, LIFE sends a team member to the hospital to help them start their lives all over again.

It’s not just a job for Margie, but her life’s work after her son was diagnosed with a cognitive disability at a young age.

“Homework was like pulling your hair out because I didn’t understand what was going on,” Moore said. “I worked with a teacher to develop a plan to help make sure he was getting everything he needed. He just used a different method.”

Margie’s volunteer work turned into her passion.

“They’re just like everyone else. Everyone gets from point A to point B, but we all use a different method,” Moore said. “Some people put so much emphasis on the method, but it’s not about that. It’s just about getting where you need to be.”

123,"Mar 1, 2021",HBCU Gameday,Deion Sanders and JSU a part of much bigger story,"A lot of headlines have come out of Jackson, Mississippi in the last six months have had to do with Deion Sanders taking over as Jackson State football coach.

So there was much anticipation for the third weekend in February when Sanders would live out his dream of becoming a head football coach. Never mind that this was a game in winter against an NAIA opponent (Edward Waters) in a spring football season that many people felt didn’t matter or shouldn’t count at all.





Sanders’ hiring had literally shaken up the HBCU football world, and reverberated beyond that. Sports Illustrated sent one of its national writers to the city to cover an HBCU game for probably the first time since the mythical 1984 Missississippi Valley-Alcorn State game. That game took place in the same stadium, Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium, that Sanders and JSU were going to make their debut.



And the media was so wrapped up in covering the spectacle of Sanders, that it largely ignored the most important story in Jackson. And not only in Jackson, but around the south, particularly in areas that are home to the SWAC.



It was me. I was the media.



My first visit to Jackson, Mississippi was a dizzying one. I took the 10 hour trip from my door to the Capitol of the Magnolia State along with Lut Williams, Editor of the Black College Sports Page, and his grandson Muhammad. We weren’t 100 percent sure we were going until Saturday morning, about 26 hours before game time. Partially because we weren’t sure there would be a game.



The preceding week had brought true winter weather to the Deep South, a region of the country that sparsely gets it. It brought along with it power outages, treacherous road conditions, and in many places, a water access issue. Jackson, Mississippi was one of those places.



Knowing the game was going to happen and wanting to be there to properly document history, we shot down I-85, hit I-20 in Atlanta and kept on trucking to Jackson. When we arrived to pick up our credentials, everyone at the stadium was working feverishly to get ready for the big game. We were greeted warmly by folks making last-minute adjustments to prepare for the first game in the stadium in nearly 15 months. We now know that many of them likely did not have running water. The combo of factors limited Jackson State to just one practice all week.





A quick chat with the hotel workers where we spent the night revealed that all rooms were booked. Not because of Deion Sanders and Jackson State, but because many people didn’t have power, and most didn’t have water.

Thankfully, our hotel did have water on that Saturday night, though the pressure was noticeably low.



The next morning we packed up and drove downtown toward’s JSU’s campus. The city was quiet. It was Sunday morning, after all.

We found our way into the motorcade leading the football team through the city to the stadium. On a normal Gameday, you could imagine the streets being full of folks hustling and bustling their way towards the tailgate area and possibly into the game. But this was anything other than normal. Again, we were going to watch a football game in late February.



The first thing I noticed when I walked in the stadium was a column-sized poster detailing JSU’s proud football history with the year of every SWAC Championship it has won etched into the graphic. It was literally picture perfect, except the fact that there were port-a-poties in front of it.



As I made my way throughout the stadium, at the same scene stood in front of a poster highlighting the four Pro Football Hall of Famers from JSU — Lem Barney, Jackie Slater, Robert Brazile and, of course, Walter Payton. I won’t lie, the photographer in me was disappointed.



Things picked up after that. COVID-19 testing to get on the field. Troy Aikman showing up. The game on the field. The J-Settes and the Boom in the stands. The first home HBCU football game anywhere since 2019. And, of course, the postgame presser and all the media blitz that followed.



Meanwhile, much of the city, including JSU’s campus, was in bad shape. By the time the game reached its end, more than 10,000 households did not have electricity. And many people were left with poor water pressure if any at all.

Jackson State alumni step up

Laura Lewis is a Jackson State alumna and president of the JSU Charlotte Metro Alumni Chapter. The chapter routinely raises scholarship funds to send students from North and South Carolina to JSU, so she stays plugged in.



“Our band students, they played during that game, but they went back on campus to no water,” Lewis said. “So we got wind of that about Tuesday, and that’s when we stepped right in.”



Lewis spoke with a manager at the local Hilton to book rooms for the students, allowing them to take showers, wash clothes, and relax as the city tried to get things right.



“It’s not the university, it’s the city of Jackson. They have some of the older infrastructures that is just not up-to-par so they’ve had water main breaks,” Lewis said. “Jackson State is in the heart of the south and the west side of Jackson, where, of course, a lot of African-Americans live. And so we are normally, like in any city, the last area that gets attention.”

Deion Sanders and JSU pushed past obstacles

The debut of Deion Sanders was undoubtedly a big deal media-wise. On the field, JSU was expected to pound on Edward Waters. Many who follow HBCU football weren’t particularly impressed, but Alabama A&M coach Connell Maynor watched and said JSU looked solid.



“I saw Jackson, and Jackson looked good,” Maynor told the Clarion-Ledger. “They did what they were supposed to do and beat them 53 to zip. I thought they looked good in their first game in coach Sanders’ first game coaching.”



Especially when you consider they only practiced once all week prior to the game.



“You have no idea what our kids have been up against, what the students on campus have been up against. What the city has been up against,” Deion Sanders said on his 21st and Prime Podcast. “But we’re perceiving. We are. And we got it done…we got it done.”



A few days ago I wrote about how HBCU football matters, even in the spring. And it does. But water access matters much more. Nearly two weeks after the storm, many residents are experiencing low-to-no water pressure. And some of those who are say they are seeing sediment come out of their pipes. While sports in general and football, in particular, is a much-needed diversion from the issues going on in our world, they are not immune from them.



“The Deep South, they really got it (the weather),” Lewis said. “It is a wake-up call. Our schools are in the heart of mostly African-American communities, so we have to be the ones that rally with the city and work with the city.”



I came to Jackson knowing there would be a story. I left thinking I knew the story. But clearly the most important question in Jackson in recent weeks isn’t whether Deion Sanders and Jackson State can climb the mountain, or what happened in the locker room after the game. It has been and continues to be when the water will get back to normal. The answer for many in the city is clearly, not soon enough.","A lot of headlines have come out of Jackson, Mississippi in the last six months have had to do with Deion Sanders taking over as Jackson State football coach.

124,"Feb 25, 2021",WLBT,Volunteer fire departments band together to provide tankers to Jackson firefighters during water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - As Jackson firefighters wrestled the flames pouring out of an abandoned house on Clifton Street Friday, crews reported low water pressure from hydrants at that location.

Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Armon said his crews shuttled water, a practice that involves hooking hoses directly to the fire trucks themselves instead of hydrants.

“That’s not as easy as it is to just tap a hydrant and get on an endless supply of water,” Armon said. “It makes the task a little more difficult, but it’s nothing that we can’t overcome and can’t do.”

Armon said each truck holds five hundred gallons of water and they typically respond with five to six trucks.

What he’s concerned about are larger fires than they’ve battled thus far.

“If we were to have [a fire] on a larger scale, like a warehouse or one of those large structures, multi-unit apartment or something like that, that would be an issue,” Armon said. “That’s where we would have a major issue.”

Hinds County EMA Director Joey Perkins said the county’s twelve volunteer fire departments are specially suited to help because they’re used to carrying water to rural areas that don’t have hydrants.

“With water out in Jackson, where they can’t get it out of fire hydrants, we’re supplying them with tankers when they go to a fire that you know, haul 3,000, 4,000, 5000 gallons of water so they can extinguish the fire,” Perkins said.

Perkins said the volunteer fire departments don’t have an actual mutual aid agreement with the city of Jackson.

Instead, they offered to help on a “handshake deal” and step in when needed.

Since the water crisis and pressure concerns began, Armon said his crews have battled nearly a dozen fires across the city.

Only once have they required the county’s services.

However, Armon also wanted to address inadvertent misinformation put out during Gov. Tate Reeves’ Tuesday press conference, when the governor said the volunteer firefighters were not only capable of providing fire service for the city of Jackson, but claimed they were doing that now.

“The county is not providing services to the citizens. The Jackson Fire Department is providing fire service to the city of Jackson. We are a Class 3 fire department and the county volunteered to provide the city of Jackson with tankers,” Armon said.

Councilman Ashby Foote says he’s encouraged by the camaraderie between the county and city during this turbulent time.

“I don’t remember a time like this where we had the water pressure this low for this extended period of time and the realization that it may go on for another week or two. And I’m glad we were able to bring in some tankers and some bottled water to address the private citizens’ concerns with drinking water, but we also need to be very aware of the challenges it presents to the fire department,” Foote said.

127,"Mar 18, 2021",Mississippi Today,Feds accuse New Summit private school leaders of bilking $2 million in Mississippi public school dollars,"When agents arrested Nancy New and her son Zach New last year on charges they allegedly stole $4 million in Mississippi welfare dollars, onlookers speculated how the popular private schools they ran, New Summit, may be implicated.

Now, the federal government is alleging the News also defrauded the Mississippi Department of Education out of $2 million they secured by filing fraudulent claims, sometimes on behalf of kids who didn’t attend the school, people who didn’t work at the school or teachers who had a lower certification level than they claimed.

Nancy New allegedly used at least $76,889 of the public school money to purchase her house in northeast Jackson, according to a series of bank transactions outlined in the indictment against her.

The U.S. Attorneys Office alleges the money came from the Mississippi Adequate Education Program, which is the name for the state’s public school funding formula. An education department spokesperson explained in a statement to Mississippi Today that “eligible accredited nonpublic schools may request MAEP add-on funds” to pay for special teacher teams to serve students with learning disabilities.

In a 12-page federal indictment unsealed Thursday morning, the News are accused of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, eight counts of wire fraud, five counts of aggravated identify theft, money laundering conspiracy and one count each of monetary transactions with proceeds of specified unlawful activity.

The News were arraigned in front of Magistrate Judge F. Keith Ball Thursday afternoon and released on a $10,000 bond. Both pleaded not guilty and trial was set for May in front of U.S. District Court Judge Carlton Reeves. If convicted on all counts, the U.S. Attorneys Office said the News could each face up to 210 years in federal prison and up to $4 million in fines.

Nancy New did not return a call or text message from Mississippi Today on Thursday. Her attorney Cynthia Speetjens and Zach New’s attorney Tom Fortner did not respond to specific questions or offer information contradicting the indictments, but said that their clients look forward to presenting their side in court.

“The allegations listed in today’s indictment are deeply troubling, and the Mississippi Department of Education is committed to continue to assist with this investigation to its conclusion,” State Superintendent of Education Carey Wright said in a statement Thursday afternoon.

New Learning Resources Inc., the for-profit umbrella school district over the New Summit Schools, was able to secure its taxpayer support in part by using high-powered lobbyists, Mississippi Today reported. But, according to a state audit, the News paid the lobbyists with federal welfare dollars that the state gave to their nonprofit, Mississippi Community Education Center, to run programs to help impoverished families.

New Learnings Resources Inc. has received a combined $28.9 million from Mississippi Department of Education since 2006 for programs for students with disabilities, through a combination of special needs scholarship account funds, dyslexia scholarships and other funding streams called Section 504 teacher units and educable child services.

New Learning Resources and the New-affiliated Mississippi Autism Center each also received about $1.5 million since 2006 from “flow-through” grants from the Legislature in the education budget, most of which in recent years — a total of $550,000 in 2017, $360,000 in 2018 and $360,000 in 2019. Inside Capital lobbyist Will Longwitz, who received the most money from the News — nearly $320,000 — told Mississippi Today he was hired to secure funding for autism and dyslexia therapists.

Nancy New and her son Zach New after they were arrested on Feb. 5, 2020, on charges they allegedly stole $4 million in welfare dollars.

Nancy New long had the support of state leaders. During his 2019 campaign for governor, Gov. Tate Reeves filmed an ad at New Summit School in Jackson, where he touted his proposed $4,300 pay raise for public school teachers. The News donated a total of $5,000 to Reeves in the past, money he later said he would return or donate.

Former Gov. Phil Bryant, who led the state during the scheme, lauded the work of Nancy New’s nonprofit, Mississippi Community Education Center, which ran a state-sanctioned program called Families First for Mississippi.

In 2018, Bryant gave Nancy New the Mississippi Meritorious Civilian Service Award, the second highest honor the governor grants.

In 2016, Bryant and his wife, Deborah, stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Nancy New and Davis, a Bryant appointee, at the ribbon cutting ceremony for the original Families First office in Jackson.

“The Families First platform has become a model of success for thousands of Mississippians and one that is being emulated all across America,” Bryant said in his final State of the State address in January 2019.

Meanwhile, the nonprofit was actually allegedly funneling millions of federal dollars intended for the state’s neediest citizens to their cronies and programs with little evidence they helped the poor.

The former Families First State Street office sits empty, much of the furnishings still intact from a year ago, on Mar. 18, 2021. The office, which was supposed to assist needy families, shut down shortly after the owner, Nancy New, of the nonprofit that ran it, Mississippi Community Education Center, was arrested on embezzlement charges. A Mississippi Department of Human Services spokesperson said the agency is planning to utilize the space for early childhood development programs in the future.

The News were two of six people agents from the state auditor’s office arrested on Feb. 5, 2020, alleging they conspired to steal more than $4 million in federal block grant funds intended to help Mississippians escape poverty.

Prosecutors filed those charges, related to Mississippi Department of Human Services and the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families federal block grant, in Hinds County Circuit Court. This week’s newly revealed charges related to the alleged Mississippi Department of Education scheme appear in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.

“I am proud of the joint work we have done with federal investigators that led to this indictment,” State Auditor Shad White said in a statement Thursday regarding the federal charges. “We are continuing to work shoulder-to-shoulder with our federal partners to advance this case, and today is another step toward justice for the taxpayers.”

About half — $2 million — of the allegedly stolen money outlined in the Hinds County indictment went to the News personally, with $2.15 million going to concussion-research firms, Prevacus and PreSolMD, companies that state leaders were trying to lure to Mississippi.

A state audit showed that money the New organizations received from government sources was often comingled between the nonprofit and for-profit entities.

From 2016-2019, the auditor found, Mississippi Community Education Center transferred a total of $6.5 million to New Learning Resources. Some employees were listed as staff members of both the nonprofit and the school.

The nonprofit paid for a New Summit School employee’s counselor license expenses, for example, and paid $42,750 to turn a lot into a baseball field next to New Summit School, which the private New Summit Academy utilized.

Several million more in questioned spending has not appeared in criminal charges.

Mississippi Today first reported that the New nonprofit paid $5 million for the construction of a new volleyball stadium at University of Southern Mississippi; covered the $9,500-a-month mortgage on former football star Marcus Dupree’s ranch in a gated Flora community; and funded a high-profile boot camp-style fitness program offered by former linebacker Paul Lacoste. A state audit released in May included each of these purchases as a finding.

One of the more headline-grabbing findings was that the New nonprofit had paid famed NFL quarterback Brett Favre’s business Favre Enterprises $1.1 million between 2017 and 2018 “to appear at several events, record promotions, and provide autographs for marketing materials.” He didn’t attend the events, the state auditor said. After the news broke, Favre promised to pay back the funds, starting with $500,000 he paid to the auditor’s office. No additional payment has been made, the office confirmed Thursday.

Besides the six arrested, no one else who received roughly $94 million in questionably spent welfare funds has been charged with a crime. It’s possible that if they had no knowledge of the overarching scheme or the source of the funds, they may not be accused of wrongdoing, officials have explained to Mississippi Today.

Former professional wrestler Brett DiBiase, who allegedly went to drug rehab on the TANF program’s dime, pleaded guilty in December to his part in the scheme. The New nonprofit’s accountant, Ann McGrew, tried to plead guilty but a judge rejected the deal in January.

The remaining four — Nancy New, Zach New, former Mississippi Department of Human Services director John Davis and agency employee Gregory “Latimer” Smith — remain innocent until proven guilty. Trials are set for coming months, but additional delays are likely.

128,"Mar 1, 2021",Vox,"“It’s after the storm that’s the hardest part”: 390,000 Texans still don’t have clean water","As of Monday morning, it had been two weeks since Helen McCanick and her neighbors in Wharton, Texas, had running water. The freezing temperatures brought by Winter Storm Uri burst their pipes and broke the motor running their well.

McCanick has spent the days since the storm traversing neighboring towns, searching for the pipe and motor parts needed to restore her water. “I am very tired of running from place to place, I really am,” she said from the parking lot of yet another hardware store.

To cook and flush the toilet, the 73-year-old has had to resort to using donated water or heavy buckets she hauls from a local church. And with replacement parts in short supply after the storm, McCanick still doesn’t know when she’ll get her water back.

“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.

Even after the electricity came back on in most homes as of February 19, water problems have lingered on a large scale. As of Monday, nearly 390,000 Texans were still being told to boil their water due to safety concerns after the storm disrupted utility water supplies, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). And that number doesn’t include the people, like McCanick, who can’t get water because their pipes broke in the cold — an issue that has affected thousands of homes in Houston alone.

The widespread failures in Texas reflect the domino effect that happens in many disasters, as power failures lead to breakdowns in water systems, putting people’s health and food security in danger. And Texas isn’t alone: Extreme weather — in some cases directly linked to climate change — has impacted water access for days, months, or even years in other states, including in the fire-ravaged West.

And yet, the long-term impacts of disasters on water systems often get less attention than the initial disaster.

For instance, the devastating Camp Fire in Paradise, California, made headlines in 2018 as the deadliest fire in the state’s history, but few know that 40,000 people were initially told to boil their water after the fire. And later, when carcinogenic chemicals were identified in the town’s pipes, Paradise residents were told not to drink their water at all — it wasn’t until more than six months after the fire that water access started to be restored.

As climate change increases the threat of extreme weather and disasters, it’s clear our infrastructure systems need to be able to withstand new pressures. And there’s a lot to learn from the latest water crises in Texas and California to avoid the next fiasco.

What caused the water failures in Texas

At the height of the water crisis on February 19, nearly 15 million people across Texas lost access to clean water, according to Gary Rasp, a spokesperson for TCEQ. This number reflects the problems that occurred in the water system itself, rather than in people’s homes.

Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, explained how the crisis rippled from the electricity grid to the water system. As the storm hit, the rapidly escalating blackout on February 15 forced water treatment plants offline. At the same time, the freezing temperatures broke water mains and people started to turn on their faucets to prevent their pipes from freezing.

Due to the combination of a drop in supply from treatment plants failing and the increase in water demand from dripping faucets and leaks, the pressure dropped in the system.

A loss in pressure can lead to dangerous bacteria in the water supply, so millions of people were told to boil their water before drinking or cooking with it. Of course, this was an impossibility for those who were also hit by the power outage and lacked electricity to power their stove.

The winter storm didn’t just cause water issues in Texas. From Oklahoma City to Jackson, Mississippi, hundreds of thousands of people also faced water shortages due to dropping water pressure.

Beyond these systemic failures, people like McCanick have also been dealing with problems closer to home, which aren’t reflected in the official numbers. One of the biggest issues has been broken pipes. In buildings not designed to weather the plunge in temperatures — from schools to houses — pipes froze and burst, sometimes dramatically, as captured in viral TikTok videos of flooded houses. Corinne Whitehead, a 70-year-old resident of San Antonio, told Vox she heard the squish of water on her floor as she stepped back into her apartment after the storm to find her pipes had burst.

And in some cases, residents have been without water for weeks because of a confluence of failures.

In the rapidly gentrifying Riverside neighborhood in Austin, Rebecca Sanchez told Vox that many of the residents in her apartment complex, the Hillside Villas, have been left without any running water for two weeks after pipes burst. Repairs have been slow, and Sanchez said the property managers have failed to provide adequate emergency water supplies in the interim. In response, she and other tenants organized a small protest last Tuesday, which the management tried to shut down by calling the police.

Afterward, the property managers accelerated the repairs, but Sanchez said half of the buildings still did not have water access as of Monday, while other properties in the area were back up and running. Further complicating matters, the city also discovered a broken water main near the complex on Friday, making the timeline for restoration of water access even less clear. The Hillside Villas property managers did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

For Sanchez, the water crisis has shown how the burden of disasters often compounds existing inequities. “It is mostly Black and brown [people’s] apartments and parts of the city that are feeling this,” she said. “There were entire white communities that never lost power and never lost water.”

Extreme weather threatens Western states’ water supplies

From the hurricanes that have hit the Gulf Coast to the wildfires that have spread across the Western US, many other communities have found themselves without clean water in the wake of recent disasters.

Just as widespread leaks and overuse caused the water system to fail after Winter Storm Uri, when houses or pipes burn in a wildfire, water pressure in distribution pipes can drop and can create a vacuum, sucking in contaminants. It was only after a resident smelled a strange odor in their tap water after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California, that scientists first uncovered such widespread chemical contamination (benzene in that case) in water systems after wildfires.

Since then, contamination after fires has led to thousands of people in a rising number of communities being put under “do not boil, do not drink” notices. This happened recently after the CZU fire struck Boulder Creek near Santa Cruz, California, in August, burning a 7-mile stretch of plastic water pipe. And like the lingering problems in Texas, these water systems have not been easy to rehabilitate.

In Boulder Creek, it took months for the water company to clear the system of the benzene — a dangerous carcinogen — initially detected, and conduct extensive testing to ensure it was really gone.

In the interim, Boulder Creek residents like Sophia Lwin-McGee were forced to live without tap water. She and her family hauled a 5-gallon water jug from a water spigot in town and tried to rely on that water or bottled water to drink, cook, and bathe.

Sitting on her deck overlooking the remains of a burnt redwood forest, Lwin-McGee told me in October that the lack of safe water access wasn’t something she expected in the US. “I feel like I’m back in Burma,” she said. “I left there when I was a kid to avoid this situation. But you know — take water, go to town, get water, bring it back — like, we are doing that every other day.”

Even after the local water company officially announced their water was safe, she and her family said they would continue avoiding the tap water as much as possible, at least for a year.

“I just can’t put myself and my son and my husband in that risk,” Lwin-McGee said. “So we are just going to have to buy bottled water to drink and cook with until, you know, we feel that it is safe.”

With climate change causing drier, hotter falls in the Western US, the conditions for extreme fires and impacts to water systems are increasing, according to a 2020 study published in Environmental Research Letters.

Stefan Cajina, a drinking water section chief for California’s State Water Resources Control Board, said he’s witnessed these changes firsthand. “I think in the last half-decade we have really seen an escalation in how [wildfires in] the wildland-urban interface can have an impact on water systems and communities in general,” he told me this fall. (Residential areas like Paradise and Boulder Creek that are on the edge of forests are described as the WUI, or wildland-urban interface, and are the most vulnerable to destructive fires.)

These rising threats mean fortifying infrastructure to handle extremes is all the more important. But Emily Grubert points out that even where climate change isn’t definitively linked to the extreme weather event, as is the case with the winter storm in Texas, the fundamental need for more resilient infrastructure is clear.

Related Scientists are divided over whether climate change is fueling extreme cold events

“We underinvest in maintenance to such a degree that these disasters tend to be pretty catastrophic,” she said. The failure of infrastructure is still being felt by the 390,000 people boiling their water in Texas today, and the nearly 2,000 people whose utilities were still not delivering water at all as of Friday, according to TCEQ.

“Adapting to extreme events and adapting to climate change is going to make all of this harder, but that’s not the only thing that is a problem,” Grubert said. “What we are really starting to have to face is this kind of combined issue where we have failed to invest in these systems for a very long time, and now we are also playing on hard mode.”","“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.

129,"Mar 2, 2021",Patch,"A Power Crisis Turns Into A Water Crisis. That Story And More Headlines For March 2, 2021","An arctic blast has sent frigid air to as far south as the U.S.–Mexico border. Sixty-nine deaths were blamed on the extreme weather, including many who perished struggling to get warm. The Texas Tribune reported that hospitals saw a spike in people suffering carbon monoxide poisoning from burning things like charcoal or gas heaters in their homes while trying to stay warm. Although power was being restored, many still had no water, and millions who did were warned that may it be unsafe to drink and should be boiled.

Last week, a blast of frigid air dropped deep into the heart of the U.S., affecting millions of people. The so-called polar vortex that normally circulates cold air around the North Pole was disturbed and sent arctic temperatures much farther south. And the breakdown of this polar vortex was a whopper—one of the biggest, nastiest, and longest-lasting meteorologists have seen, overwhelming the Texas power grid and cutting off electricity to millions.

The crisis was not confined to Texas. In Tennessee, hundreds of thousands of people were under a boil advisory, and in Jackson, Mississippi, at one point most of the city had no running water.

Nearly 15 million people were affected by disruptions and some resorted to using snow to flush toilets. At food bank and water distribution sites, lines stretched as long as a mile. The Texas Tribune reported that systems couldn't treat or pump water without electricity, and that in some cases reduced water pressure was caused by millions of people dripping their faucets for days so pipes wouldn't freeze. In Houston, the public works department had to slow down the water treatment process since the chemical feed lines had frozen, and in Austin the water supply lost 325 million gallons due to burst pipes.

Besides problems in the U.S., the meandering polar vortex brought snow to Greece and Turkey, and CBS reports that in Saudi Arabia snow-covered camels made for a rare sight.

Insurance companies are expecting hundreds of thousands of claims, with the event likely to be the largest disaster in Texas history.

Judah Cohen of Atmospheric and Environmental Research told the Guardian that the uptick in winter storms is a symptom of heating in the Arctic that is disrupting long-established climate systems.

Liz Sherwood-Randall, a National Security Advisor to the White House, said that the extreme weather events across the central, southern, and eastern United States demonstrate again that climate change is real and happening now, and the country is not adequately prepared for it. She noted that power grids across the country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are placed on them under these circumstances, and the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme conditions.

Cold Weather Causes a Spike in Pollution from Fossil Fuel Infrastructure

During the cold weather event in Texas, refineries, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure were freezing up and releasing pollutants into the air, an analysis has found. The online news site Earther looked at reports from the Texas Department of Environmental Quality that showed that during the week ending February 18, polluting events occurred at a rate about four times higher than other recent seven-day periods before the cold weather struck.

Data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for reported emissions events over the past three weeks shows a sharp uptick during the cold weather outbreak | Credit: Earther with data compiled by Earthworks



For example, ExxonMobil's refinery near Houston spewed 68,000 pounds of carbon monoxide over the course of two days as it struggled with the cold. The specific health impacts of this kind of pollution on Texans is well documented.

Sharon Wilson of Earthworks told Earther that all oil and gas infrastructure starts with a hole in the ground, and it keeps pumping even if machinery is frozen. So, when a pipeline is frozen, everything gets released into the air and just keeps going. She said that some reports noted glitches as tiny as a frozen switch stalled operations and forced excess gas to be released, adding that if the industry had winterized their equipment, the pollution could have been avoided.

Thousands of Paralyzed Sea Turtles Rescued from Freezing Waters

The extreme cold also caused problems for marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico. Sea turtles are cold-blooded animals that regulate their bodies by the water temperature, and as National Geographic reports, when it dips below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, their heart rates slow, leaving them conscious but paralyzed.



Many turtles washed up onshore at South Padre Island, and in response, an army of people—many of whom were struggling themselves to survive—rushed to rescue about 5,000 of the creatures. Some turtles were taken to a rescue facility and more than 4,000 were sheltered in a nearby convention center, resting on tarps spread out on every foot of floor space—including the gift shop. Even when that center lost power, it was still warmer for the turtles than being in the sea. One of those rescued weighed about 400 pounds and was at least 150 years old. It took ten men to hoist it onto a truck.

Scientists are monitoring water temperatures so they can safely release the turtles. Without the rescue, 40 years of conservation work to protect them could have been wiped out.

Study: Frogs Could Lose Their Ability to Hop

As the climate shifts there are concerns about how Earth's biodiversity will respond. Not only are regions getting warmer, but precipitation patterns are changing, and, according to a new study, the combination could make frogs lose the ability to hop.

New paper from Dan Greenberg and Wendy Palen illustrates the importance of integrating species' hydration physiology into forecasts of climate vulnerability, as forecasts using thermal physiology alone may significantly underestimate the effects of future climate change on Earth's biological diversity. | Credit: Palen Lab/Simon Fraser University



Scientists from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, did an experiment with three species: the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), which lives near cold mountain streams, the desert-adapted great basin spadefoot toad (Spea intermontana), and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla), which can adjust to various habitats.

As NewScientist reports, the researchers placed frogs and toads in climate-controlled chambers where they could dictate the amphibian's temperature and hydration. They found that the more dehydrated the frogs were, the shorter distance they could leap—and once they lost 30 percent of their body weight they stopped jumping entirely. The frogs and toads were even more impacted when they were both dehydrated and subjected to warmer temperatures—as will likely happen with climate change.

The scientists think there are a few reasons for the reduced ability to leap, one of which could be that as the animals become dehydrated their blood becomes thicker and harder for their heart muscles to pump. One of the researchers, Dan Greenberg, said as soon as the temperatures went up a little bit, the tree frogs in particular would sort of hunker down in a way that reduces water loss, as if they were thinking, 'This isn't going to be good for me.""

Since many frogs jump to avoid predators, this could have devastating consequences, and the researchers think their findings might have implications for other animals like insects, arthropods, and reptiles.

The paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Watering Restrictions Have a Surprising Bonus

Adhering to water conservation mandates and watching how much you use your sprinklers may have an added benefit—fewer mosquitoes. According to a new study from UCLA, mosquito populations would have been 40 percent higher in Southern California had water use mandates not been in place.

Mosquitoes, like those that carry West Nile virus, Zika, and dengue fever, can breed in just a few milliliters of water—about a bottlecap's worth—sitting in the shade for a few days. Hundreds of eggs hatch at a time before the insects grow into biting adults in just over a week. The researchers say that reducing shallow pools of water is key to preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Looking at Orange and Los Angeles counties from 2012 to 2016 they found that the numbers of mosquitoes declined more in lower-income areas than in wealthier neighborhoods—most likely, they say, because homeowners who could afford to ignored restrictions and continued watering their lawns and gardens.

The authors note that as the planet warms, keeping lawns green and healthy will be challenging, so replacing them with drought-tolerant plants and creating green infrastructure would not only conserve water and reduce bills but also make it less likely to get bit by a disease-transmitting mosquito.

The study was published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

130,"Apr 15, 2021",The Conversation,"Nearly 60 million Americans don’t drink their tap water, research suggests – here’s why that’s a public health problem","Imagine seeing a news report about lead contamination in drinking water in a community that looks like yours. It might make you think twice about whether to drink your tap water or serve it to your kids – especially if you also have experienced tap water problems in the past.

In a new study, my colleagues Anisha Patel, Francesca Weaks and I estimate that approximately 61.4 million people in the U.S. did not drink their tap water as of 2017-2018. Our research, which was released in preprint format on April 8, 2021, and has not yet been peer reviewed, found that this number has grown sharply in the past several years.

Other research has shown that about 2 million Americans don’t have access to clean water. Taking that into account, our findings suggest that about 59 million people have tap water access from either their municipality or private wells or cisterns, but don’t drink it. While some may have contaminated water, others may be avoiding water that’s actually safe.

Water insecurity is an underrecognized but growing problem in the U.S. Tap water distrust is part of the problem. And it’s critical to understand what drives it, because people who don’t trust their tap water shift to more expensive and often less healthy options, like bottled water or sugary drinks.

I’m a human biologist and have studied water and health for the past decade in places as diverse as Lowland Bolivia and northern Kenya. Now I run the Water, Health, and Nutrition Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. To understand water issues, I talk to people and use large datasets to see whether a problem is unique or widespread, and stable or growing.

An epidemic of distrust

According to our research, there’s a growing epidemic of tap water distrust and disuse in the U.S. In a 2020 study, anthropologist Sera Young and I found that tap water avoidance was declining before the Flint water crisis that began in 2014. In 2015-2016, however, it started to increase again for children.

Our new study found that in 2017-2018, the number of Americans who didn’t drink tap water increased at an alarmingly high rate, particularly for Black and Hispanic adults and children. Since 2013-2014 – just before the Flint water crisis began – the prevalence of adults who do not drink their tap water has increased by 40%. Among children, not consuming tap has risen by 63%.

To calculate this change, we used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey that releases data in two-year cycles. Sampling weights that use demographic characteristics ensure that the people being sampled are representative of the broader U.S. population.

Racial disparities in tap water consumption

Communities of color have long experienced environmental injustice across the U.S. Black, Hispanic and Native American residents are more likely to live in environmentally disadvantaged neighborhoods, with exposure to water that violates quality standards.

Our findings reflect these experiences. We calculated that Black and Hispanic children and adults are two to three times more likely to report not drinking their tap water than members of white households. In 2017-2018, roughly 3 out of 10 Black adults and children and nearly 4 of 10 Hispanic adults and children didn’t drink their tap water. Approximately 2 of 10 Asian Americans didn’t drink from their tap, while only 1 of 10 white Americans didn’t drink their tap water.

When children don’t drink any water on a given day, research shows that they consume twice as many calories from sugary drinks as children who drink water. Higher sugary drink consumption increases risk of cavities, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Drinking tap water provides fluoride, which lowers the risk of cavities. Relying on water alternatives is also much more expensive than drinking tap water.

What erodes trust

News reports – particularly high-visibility events like advisories to boil water – lead people to distrust their tap water even after the problem is fixed. For example, a 2019 study showed that water quality violations across the U.S. between 2006 and 2015 led to increases in bottled water purchases in affected counties as a way to avoid tap water, and purchase rates remained elevated after the violation.

The Flint water crisis drew national attention to water insecurity, even though state and federal regulators were slow to respond to residents’ complaints there. Soon afterward, lead contamination was found in the water supply of Newark, New Jersey; the city is currently replacing all lead service lines under a legal settlement. Elsewhere, media outlets and advocacy groups have reported finding tap water samples contaminated with industrial chemicals, lead, arsenic and other contaminants.

Many other factors can cause people to distrust their water supply, including smell, taste and appearance, as well as lower income levels. Location is also an issue: Older U.S. cities with aging infrastructure are more prone to water shutoffs and water quality problems.

It’s important not to blame people for distrusting what comes out of their tap, because those fears are rooted in history. In my view, addressing water insecurity requires a two-part strategy: ensuring that everyone has access to clean water, and increasing trust so people who have safe water will use it.

Building confidence

As part of his proposed infrastructure plan, President Joe Biden is asking Congress for US$111 billion to improve water delivery systems, replace lead pipelines and tackle other contaminants. The plan also proposes improvements for small water systems and underserved communities.

These are critical steps to rebuild trust. Yet, in my view, the Environmental Protection Agency should also provide better public education about water quality testing and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, such as children and underserved communities. Initiatives to simplify and improve water quality reports can help people understand what’s in their water and what they can do if they think something is wrong with it.

Who delivers those messages is important. In areas like Flint, where former government officials have been indicted on charges including negligence and perjury in connection with the water crisis, the government’s word alone won’t rebuild trust. Instead, community members can fill this critical role.

Another priority is the 13%-15% of Americans who rely on private well water, which is not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. These households are responsible for their own water quality testing. Public funding would help them test it regularly and address any problems.

Public distrust of tap water in the U.S. reflects decades of policies that have reduced access to reliable, safe drinking water in communities of color. Fixing water lines is important, but so is giving people confidence to turn on the tap.

131,1 month ago,Mississippi Today,Medical marijuana protesters call on Mississippi politicians to ‘stop the steal’,"Carolyn Prisock had a brain tumor removed 15 years ago, and suffers debilitating migraines and side effects from medications — one caused her to temporarily lose her eyesight.

Prisock was hopeful that the medical marijuana program Mississippi voters approved in November would offer her some relief and an alternative to pharmaceuticals she said “are like-taking poison.” But she said the state Supreme Court “pulled the rug out from under our feet.”

Prisock, 56, of rural Louisville was among a little over 200 people who rallied near the Supreme Court building and state Capitol on Tuesday morning. They were protesting the high court’s ruling that struck down the Initiative 65 medical marijuana program voters passed, and that also nullified Mississippi voters’ right to change the state constitution.

The protesters called on Gov. Tate Reeves to call the Mississippi Legislature back to Jackson in special session, and for lawmakers to reinstate the medical marijuana program and voters’ ballot initiative right to take matters in their own hands.

Some legislative leaders have joined this call. Reeves said he’s open to calling a session, but still “a long way” from that decision. He said legislative leaders would have to be on the same page first. So far, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann who oversees the Senate said he’s open to passing a medical marijuana program, but believes fixing the ballot initiative process could wait until next year. House Speaker Philip Gunn wants a special session to deal with the ballot initiative, but said medical marijuana could wait.

“If I want to put something natural in my body instead of all these chemicals, that should be my choice,” Prisock said.

The rally was hastily organized by “We Are the 74,” a group that in a little over a week has garnered more than 8,500 members on its Facebook site. The 74 refers to the 74% of voters that chose Initiative 65 over an alternative placed on the November ballot by lawmakers — although opponents of the initiative note that a smaller majority voted in favor of medical marijuana overall in the two-question ballot proposal.

The rally included live music — with a band striking up a few old 60’s marijuana standards — and several speakers. It drew a diverse crowd of patients and families, cannabis advocates, entrepreneurs hoping to get into the marijuana business, and voters who feel like they’ve been rooked by the court and politicians.

PODCAST: Breaking down the Supreme Court marijuana initiative decision

Wilson Hunt of Tupelo said the rally was the first he’s attended in his 55 years. He came because, “The will of the people has been thwarted, and this is a state that has been vocal about the will of the people being thwarted on a national level.” Hunt carried a poster that said, “New math. 6>766,000?” Referring to the six high court justices that voter to overturn voters’ initiative. A friend of Hunt’s carried a sign that said, “Stop the Steal.”

Will Reed, also of Tupelo, owns an organic farm and produce company, and received the first license in Mississippi to grow hemp after it was federally legalized. He had hoped to start farming medicinal marijuana, and had made some investment in such an operation before the court ruling put a halt to the program.

“Both my wife and I had health issues. Using marijuana helped us tremendously, it’s what inspired us to open our business,” said Santita Delaney of Pearl, owner of Hemp World. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today

Chad King, a Jackson attorney, and partners had already invested in Jackson real estate and were moving to open a cannabis business “and were ready to bring at least 90 jobs to Jackson” when the ruling halted it.

King hopes Tuesday’s rally and the ire of many voters prompts action.

“I hope it encourages the leadership to step up and do something,” King said. “Over and above medical marijuana, the Supreme Court struck down people’s voice. Taking people’s voice away with the right to pass amendments is huge.”

The Supreme Court ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Madison Mayor Mary Hawkins Butler. She argued the initiative process should be voided because the state constitution requires the signatures to be gathered equally from five congressional districts as they were configured in 1990. But in the early 2000s, the state lost a U.S. House seat because of population loss, rendering it impossible to gather the signatures as mandated in the Constitution.

Voters bypassed the lawmakers and approved medical marijuana after years of inaction on the issue by the Legislature despite growing grassroots support and other states legalizing it.

Jasmine Cochran, a Picayune native, was teaching school in China when she learned her father had been diagnosed with cancer, and she quickly returned home. She spoke to the crowd in Jackson on Tuesday, and lamented Mississippi being historically and continually the unhealthiest state.

‘I was bootlegging edibles for her. Those opioids would leave her depressed,’ said retired pharmaceutical industry worker Ken Flynt of Bailey, holding a picture of his late mother Mattie Bessie Caraway Flynt. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today

“It’s just numbers until one of those numbers is your dad or your mom or your kid,” Cochran said. “… I see my dad struggling for help every day, and we could give it to him with a plant … You’d be hard pressed to find a more divided state, but we all came together (with Initiative 65) because we felt there was a better, smarter, healthier way than with endless opiates … If there is no special session, then the 74% will get together again when it’s the next time to vote and invite (politicians) to leave.”

Puckett native Austin Calhoun also spoke Tuesday. He has suffered terrible seizures and other issues for years, and his mother, Angie Calhoun was a vocal supporter and organizer of the Initiative 65 movement. Austin had moved out of state so he could be treated with medical marijuana, but was planning to return after initiative 65 passed.

He called for the governor and lawmakers to “do what is right by Mississippians.”

“Call a special session as soon as possible,” Calhoun said. “… Be the patients’ and voters’ heroes and bring back to Mississippi what was unjustly taken from us. All I want is to be able to return home to this state. Do not give up the fight for democracy to be carried out in Mississippi.”

You’ve met Mr. Morrow before. We had a story about him not long ago releasing a magazine about the history of Jackson automobile dealers and dealerships on the 20th Century and how these guys not only sold cars, but built Jackson as the same time.

Well, Johnny Morrow’s latest venture in a Black History calendar, with a personality respected by Johnny on every page for all of the year. Multiple people on some pages.

He had 50 calendars printed up and immediately they were gobbled up. So, they are back at the presses again, cranking out more. Johnny told me a part of his rational for selecting who he did was these are people who have been around for a long time and have made an indelible mark on our community, state and history.

Some of them you will recognize their names, James Meredith, for instance. He was the first Black student admitted to the University of Mississippi. There’s a shot of the stage when President Bill Clinton presented the commencement address at Tugaloo College. Pretty much all of these people are showcased against some of Johnny’s antique car collection.

He said he wanted to feature people you might not think of right off the top of your head in association with Black History Month, but people who deserve the recognition.

You just have to know Johnny Morrow or know someone who knows him. Get a calendar, if you want one. You’ve heard of the six degrees of separation?

134,1 month ago,WJTV,Jackson Public Works director provides update on efforts to fix wells,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Even those on the well water system in Jackson and Byram have gotten tied up in the City of Jackson’s water crisis with no clear timeframe on how long till it gets fixed or what needs to be replaced. Crews are still digging around the TV Road well, which distributes water to more than 2,000 customers along with Maddox, Raymond, and TV Road communities. Going into day seven of little to no water pressure, people are demanding more accountability.

For seven months Tangela Williams and her son worked to turn their new home off Forest Hill Road into their dream house. For the past week, simple house chores are becoming impossible to do without running water.

“This is actually clean bottled water I had used to pour and be up to date to be able to cook,” Williams stated. “Here’s another bottle of water I have to use to drink, to cook, and all that because I have no water.”

After restoring running water to the well off Siwell Road, contractors with Jackson are able to focus more on the TV Road well, but they will have many pipes to dig through. They won’t know what needs to be fixed until Tuesday morning.

“It’s a very labor-intensive and tedious work in order to break down a well and determine the cause and then gets it repaired,” Dr. Charles Williams, Jackson’s Public Works Director, said. “So, it takes some time, and we understand time is really not on our side because we have customers who are without water.”

For days, the Williams family have been unable to wash dishes, on top of going elsewhere to simply shower as early as 4:00 a.m. They’re even relying on rainwater saved in a trashcan to flush toilets.

“Even when they have the water giveaways it’s during work hours, people at work, we don’t have time to go get water. We’re working so that doesn’t do any good for those who work so we have to spend money on water,” said Williams.

The water well on Siwell Road ended up needing a new pump to be fully repaired, which the Public Works Department has yet to find. Until they do, the best scenario on how to fix the TV Road well remains unknown.

All well customers along with TV and Siwell Road for the time being remain under a boil water notice. They are asked to conserve water.

Tangela and her neighbors add that they’re unsure if they’ll continue to live in Jackson if this continues.","Crews are still digging around the TV Road well, which distributes water to more than 2,000 customers along with Maddox, Raymond, and TV Road communities.

135,3 weeks ago,WLBT,"Resolution to change Jackson’s form of government sent back to committee after mayor, councilwoman express concerns","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - A resolution that would have signified unity among Jackson city councilmembers to embrace a new form of government for the Capital City now resides in a committee without a vote because of concerns expressed from the city’s mayor and a councilwoman Tuesday about citizens being cut out or unduly influenced by the action.

“I really feel like this is just the cart before the horse. And I really think that with all due respect, [Ward 4 Councilman De’Keither] Stamps, I think I’m just gonna vote against it,” said Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay, shortly before Council President Aaron Banks sent the resolution back to the committee from which it originated.

The measure, placed on the agenda by Stamps days ago, would have been non-binding; changing a city’s form of government requires a petition and referendum before it can move forward, according to state law.

“What we have now is a system that’s great for contractors. But is it good for people? Is it good for progress? Is it good for efficiency?” Stamps said in an interview Wednesday. “Does it root out fraud, waste, and abuse? And those are the types of questions and answers that we have to start seeking.”

Stamps remains particularly frustrated because of the city’s ongoing water crisis; he stressed to council members Tuesday that he cannot truly address the needs of his residents without going through a process that may not even lead to help for his residents.

“I got folks ain’t had water in a month, right? And all we get is a pump, the most minimum thing to fix the problem? Well, I want the complete solution. I want more towers, I want more water in west and south Jackson. But if I don’t have four votes to do it, under this structure, it’s not gonna happen,” Stamps said.

Jackson’s strong mayor-weak council form of government puts the day-to-day operations of the city with the mayor, with the council holding the purse strings, setting policy and drafting the budget.

The council-manager form, which Stamps has been advocating for since 2016, would establish a city manager to handle day-to-day issues and let the mayor run council meetings, with both of them setting policy for the city.

“Over half of the governments in this country run on the council-manager form of government. A lot of big cities,” Stamps said, citing Las Vegas, Nevada, and Norfolk, Virginia as examples.

Several cities in Mississippi do, too.

“The city manager form of government, in my opinion, certainly does provide more accountability,” said Michael Silverman, who serves as city manager for Pascagoula until June 17.

Silverman has served in this position for more than a year and a half, working as city manager for a municipality in Michigan before coming to Mississippi.

“Because city managers are not obligated to serve just one elected official, it’s obligated to serve the entire governing body. And it’s the city manager’s job to make sure they’re addressing the needs of each and every counselor, no matter the ward, no matter the issue,” Silverman said.

Silverman said it also means greater stability for city departments.

With the city of Jackson’s current form of government, department directors are usually replaced once a new mayor takes office.

In the council-manager form, however, the same city manager could continue independent of newly-elected council or mayoral candidates.

The position allows for a qualified professional to manage city departments in a non-partisan, independent way, Silverman added.

Stamps said the challenges facing the city have only gotten worse since he first proposed the change.

Jackson has had a mayor-council form of government since the mid-1980s.

“We’ve had almost two wards pack up and leave Jackson with our population decline. So should we have seven council people? Or should we have less? Our budget on government is increasing, but our population is decreasing. So we must restructure our government based on what we can afford,” Stamps said. “The goal is a unified leadership. The city can’t move forward and be the one voice that it should be when it has multiple voices. We need one leadership. And so this structure will allow us to unify the leadership to be on one accord.”

It also takes significant control of day-to-day functions away from the mayor.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he wanted to be reserved in his comments about the subject during Tuesday’s meeting, but expressed a concern about representation in communities and the resolution coming before the council before any grassroots effort to gather petitions had kicked off.

“I think the long history of politics tells us that when people feel that someone is imposing or stating their will over people without their voice, whether it’s over the governance of the city of Jackson, or whether it’s over the price of tea, people have a lot of issues with that,” Lumumba said. “And so we need to look deep in the history and understand that the council speaks through its resolutions. It doesn’t start the [legal] process, but it certainly puts you on the line for what your position is for the people without them having stated their case.”

137,"Feb 19, 2021",Oregon Live,Extreme cold and water shortages: Weather blamed in deaths of at least 58 people across U.S.,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Many of the millions of Texans who lost power for days after a deadly winter blast overwhelmed the electric grid now have it back, but the crisis was far from over in parts of the South, with many people lacking safe drinking water.

More than 190,000 homes and businesses remained without power in Texas according to poweroutage.us Friday morning, down from about 3 million two days earlier, though utility officials said limited rolling blackouts were still possible.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The snow and ice moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the Northeast as the extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 58 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond and 17-year-old Oklahoma girl who fell into a frozen pond.

A growing number of people have perished trying to keep warm. In and around the western Texas city of Abilene, authorities said six people died of the cold — including a 60-year-old man found dead in his bed in his frigid home. In the Houston area, a family died from carbon monoxide as their car idled in their garage.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas used rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. But the remaining Texas outages were mostly weather-related, according to the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said Friday that teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

Rotating outages for Texas could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, said Dan Woodfin, the council’s senior director of system operations.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned that residents “are not out of the woods,” with temperatures still well below freezing statewide, south central Texas threatened by a winter storm and disruptions in food supply chains.

Adding to the misery: The weather jeopardized drinking water systems. Authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it, following the record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and pipes. In Abilene, a man who died at a health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

Water pressure dropped after lines froze and because many people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, said Toby Baker, executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Abbott urged residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

President Joe Biden said he called Abbott on Thursday evening and offered additional support from the federal government to state and local agencies.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Federal emergency officials sent generators to support water treatment plants, hospitals and nursing homes in Texas, along with thousands of blankets and ready-to-eat meals, officials said. The Texas Restaurant Association was coordinating food donations to hospitals.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water after cold temperatures led to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

In Texas, more than 300 flights in and out of Dallas and Houston were canceled Friday, according to flightaware.com. Particularly affected was American Airlines, headquartered in Fort Worth.

In Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said most of the city of about 161,000 was without water Thursday night. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals to treat the water, she said.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

About 85 seniors in a Jackson apartment building lost water service Monday and were relying on deliveries from a building manager, said resident Linda Weathersby.

Weathersby went outside collecting buckets of ice to melt it so she could flush her toilet and said “my back’s hurting now.”

Before the wintry weather moved from Texas, the city of Del Rio along the U.S.-Mexico border, got nearly 10 inches (25.4 cm) of snow on Thursday, surpassing the city’s one-day record for snowfall.

138,"Apr 15, 2021",Mic,We don't trust our tap water — and it's a big problem,"Imagine seeing a news report about lead contamination in drinking water in a community that looks like yours. It might make you think twice about whether to drink your tap water or serve it to your kids – especially if you also have experienced tap water problems in the past.

In a new study, my colleagues Anisha Patel, Francesca Weaks and I estimate that approximately 61.4 million people in the U.S. did not drink their tap water as of 2017-2018. Our research, which was released in preprint format on April 8, 2021, and has not yet been peer reviewed, found that this number has grown sharply in the past several years.

Other research has shown that about 2 million Americans don’t have access to clean water. Taking that into account, our findings suggest that about 59 million people have tap water access from either their municipality or private wells or cisterns, but don’t drink it. While some may have contaminated water, others may be avoiding water that’s actually safe.

Water insecurity is an underrecognized but growing problem in the U.S. Tap water distrust is part of the problem. And it’s critical to understand what drives it, because people who don’t trust their tap water shift to more expensive and often less healthy options, like bottled water or sugary drinks.

I’m a human biologist and have studied water and health for the past decade in places as diverse as Lowland Bolivia and northern Kenya. Now I run the Water, Health, and Nutrition Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. To understand water issues, I talk to people and use large datasets to see whether a problem is unique or widespread, and stable or growing.

A video from the South Coast Water District in southern California urges customers to choose tap water over bottled water.

An epidemic of distrust

According to our research, there’s a growing epidemic of tap water distrust and disuse in the U.S. In a 2020 study, anthropologist Sera Young and I found that tap water avoidance was declining before the Flint water crisis that began in 2014. In 2015-2016, however, it started to increase again for children.

Our new study found that in 2017-2018, the number of Americans who didn’t drink tap water increased at an alarmingly high rate, particularly for Black and Hispanic adults and children. Since 2013-2014 — just before the Flint water crisis began — the prevalence of adults who do not drink their tap water has increased by 40%. Among children, not consuming tap has risen by 63%.

To calculate this change, we used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey that releases data in two-year cycles. Sampling weights that use demographic characteristics ensure that the people being sampled are representative of the broader U.S. population.

Racial disparities in tap water consumption

Communities of color have long experienced environmental injustice across the U.S. Black, Hispanic and Native American residents are more likely to live in environmentally disadvantaged neighborhoods, with exposure to water that violates quality standards.

Our findings reflect these experiences. We calculated that Black and Hispanic children and adults are two to three times more likely to report not drinking their tap water than members of white households. In 2017-2018, roughly 3 out of 10 Black adults and children and nearly 4 of 10 Hispanic adults and children didn’t drink their tap water. Approximately 2 of 10 Asian Americans didn’t drink from their tap, while only 1 of 10 white Americans didn’t drink their tap water.

When children don’t drink any water on a given day, research shows that they consume twice as many calories from sugary drinks as children who drink water. Higher sugary drink consumption increases risk of cavities, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Drinking tap water provides fluoride, which lowers the risk of cavities. Relying on water alternatives is also much more expensive than drinking tap water.

What erodes trust

News reports — particularly high-visibility events like advisories to boil water — lead people to distrust their tap water even after the problem is fixed. For example, a 2019 study showed that water quality violations across the U.S. between 2006 and 2015 led to increases in bottled water purchases in affected counties as a way to avoid tap water, and purchase rates remained elevated after the violation.

The Flint water crisis drew national attention to water insecurity, even though state and federal regulators were slow to respond to residents’ complaints there. Soon afterward, lead contamination was found in the water supply of Newark, New Jersey; the city is currently replacing all lead service lines under a legal settlement. Elsewhere, media outlets and advocacy groups have reported finding tap water samples contaminated with industrial chemicals, lead, arsenic and other contaminants.

Many other factors can cause people to distrust their water supply, including smell, taste and appearance, as well as lower income levels. Location is also an issue: Older U.S. cities with aging infrastructure are more prone to water shutoffs and water quality problems.

It’s important not to blame people for distrusting what comes out of their tap, because those fears are rooted in history. In my view, addressing water insecurity requires a two-part strategy: ensuring that everyone has access to clean water, and increasing trust so people who have safe water will use it.

Building confidence

As part of his proposed infrastructure plan, President Joe Biden is asking Congress for $111 billion to improve water delivery systems, replace lead pipelines and tackle other contaminants. The plan also proposes improvements for small water systems and underserved communities.

These are critical steps to rebuild trust. Yet, in my view, the Environmental Protection Agency should also provide better public education about water quality testing and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, such as children and underserved communities. Initiatives to simplify and improve water quality reports can help people understand what’s in their water and what they can do if they think something is wrong with it.

Who delivers those messages is important. In areas like Flint, where former government officials have been indicted on charges including negligence and perjury in connection with the water crisis, the government’s word alone won’t rebuild trust. Instead, community members can fill this critical role.

Another priority is the 13%-15% of Americans who rely on private well water, which is not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. These households are responsible for their own water quality testing. Public funding would help them test it regularly and address any problems.

Public distrust of tap water in the U.S. reflects decades of policies that have reduced access to reliable, safe drinking water in communities of color. Fixing water lines is important, but so is giving people confidence to turn on the tap.

139,1 month ago,WLBT,Reeves one of 20 governors demanding action from Biden on southern border,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Governor Reeves and 19 other governors signed a letter calling on President Biden and Vice President Harris to take action on the “crisis” at the southern border.

The letter begins by saying, “Dear President Biden and Vice President Harris, We call on you to take action on the crisis at the southern border immediately. Contrary to statements from your Administration, the border is neither closed nor secure. In fact, the Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) reports a staggering surge in recent crossings: 172,000 encounters in March, the highest number in nearly 20 years, as well as 18,890 unaccompanied children, the largest monthly number in history.”

The letter says, “the crisis is too big to ignore and is now spilling over the border states into all of our states.”

Last month, The White House said President Biden does not believe it’s a crisis for children to cross the border seeking refuge.

In March, Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Ted Cruz (R-TX) were among a group of 19 Republicans that visited the U.S.-Mexico border. Local and state leaders in Mississippi agree this is a considerable problem along the southern border, but no one agrees on the solution.

The letter goes on to read, “Beyond the humanitarian crisis, the lack of border security is a criminal one, threatening the safety of American citizens.

140,1 month ago,WLBT,Why Lumumba is not lifting Jackson’s mask mandate right now,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - In his weekly press conference about several city initiatives, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced he will not be lifting the city’s COVID-19 executive order on masks right now.

The mayor said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has yet to provide instruction or guidance on how cities should administer a program that distinguishes a vaccinated person from a non-vaccinated person.

Right now, the mayor says 36% of Hinds County is vaccinated, and he says that percentage is too low to lift the mask mandate at this time.

“We are tossing around some internal numbers in terms of what we wanna see, and we will not share that at this time,” he said.

March, Governor Reeves replaced all executive orders with “recommendations.”

Then last week, the CDC dropped its mask mandate for fully vaccinated people, and Biden followed suit, proclaiming it ‘A great day for America.’

Many businesses have already changed their mask policies, including Walmart, Sam’s Club, Starbucks, Costco, Trader Joe’s, and Target.

But make sure to check the rules before you leave your mask at home because pharmacies, some sports venues, and grocery chains like Kroger still require face coverings.

It’s causing some confusion.

As for Jackson, Lumumba said wearings masks are still a requirement within city limits.

“We’re looking at this from a scientific standpoint, not a political standpoint. We follow the CDC’s guidelines, and that is informative to us. And so we want to take that information and see how does that applies to how a city creates the safest environment we possibly can.”

The mayor did not give a timeline on when he expects to lift the mask order.

Introduction

Billions of people around the world lack adequate access to one of the essential elements of life: clean water. Although governments and aid groups have helped many living in water-stressed regions gain access in recent years, the problem is projected to get worse with the harmful effects of global warming and population growth.

Water stress can differ dramatically from one place to another, in some cases causing wide-reaching damage, including to public health, economic development, and global trade. It can also drive mass migrations and spark conflict. Now, pressure is mounting on countries to implement more sustainable and innovative practices and to improve international cooperation on water management.

What is water stress?

Water stress or scarcity occurs when demand for safe, usable water in a given area exceeds the supply. On the demand side, the vast majority—roughly 70 percent—of the world’s freshwater is used for agriculture, while the rest is divided between industrial (19 percent) and domestic uses (11 percent), including for drinking. On the supply side, sources include surface waters, such as rivers, lakes, and reservoirs, as well as groundwater, accessed through aquifers.

But scientists have different ways of defining and measuring water stress, taking into account a variety of factors including seasonal changes, water quality, and accessibility. Meanwhile, measurements of water stress can be imprecise, particularly in the case of groundwater. “Any numbers out there have to be taken with a grain of salt,” says Upmanu Lall, a Columbia University professor and water expert. “None of these definitions are typically accounting for groundwater usage, or groundwater stock.”

What causes water scarcity?

Water scarcity is often divided into two categories: physical scarcity, when there is a shortage of water because of local ecological conditions; and economic scarcity, when there is inadequate water infrastructure.

The two frequently come together to cause water stress. For instance, a stressed area can have both a shortage of rainfall as well as a lack of adequate water storage and sanitation facilities. Experts say that even when there are significant natural causes for a region’s water stress, human factors are often central to the problem, particularly with regard to access to clean water and safe sanitation.

“Almost always the drinking water problem has nothing to do with physical water scarcity,” says Georgetown University’s Mark Giordano, an expert on water management. “It has to do with the scarcity of financial and political wherewithal to put in the infrastructure to get people clean water. It’s separate.”

At the same time, some areas that suffer physical water scarcity have the infrastructure that has allowed life there to thrive, such as in Oman and the southwestern United States.

A variety of authorities, from the national level down to local jurisdictions, govern or otherwise influence the water supply. In the United States, more than half a dozen federal agencies deal with different aspects of water: the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) enforces regulations on clean water, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) prepares for and responds to water disasters. Similar authorities exist at the state and local levels to protect and oversee the use of water resources, including through zoning and rehabilitation projects.

Which regions are most water-stressed?

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is the worst off in terms of physical water stress, according to most experts. MENA receives less rainfall than other regions, and its countries tend to have fast-growing, densely populated urban centers that require more water. But many countries in these regions, especially wealthier ones, still meet their water needs. For example, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) imports nearly all of its food, alleviating the need to use water for agriculture. The UAE and other wealthy MENA countries also rely heavily on the desalination of abundant ocean water, albeit this process is an expensive, energy-intensive one.

Meanwhile, places experiencing significant economic scarcity include Central African countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, which receives a lot of rain but lacks proper infrastructure and suffers from high levels of mismanagement.

Even high-income countries experience water stress. Factors including outdated infrastructure and rapid population growth have put tremendous stress on some U.S. water systems, causing crises in cities including Flint, Michigan, and Newark, New Jersey.

How is climate change affecting water stress?

Global warming is expected to increase the number of water-stressed areas and heighten water stress in already affected regions. Subtropical areas, such as Australia, the southern United States, and North African countries, are expected to warm and suffer more frequent and longer droughts; however, when rainfall does occur in these regions, it is projected to be more intense. Weather in tropical regions will likewise become more variable, climate scientists say.

Agriculture could become a particular challenge. Farming suffers as rainfall becomes more unpredictable and rising temperatures accelerate the evaporation of water from soil. A more erratic climate is also expected to bring more floods, which can wipe out crops, overwhelm storage systems, and sweep up sediment that can clog treatment facilities.

In a 2018 report, a panel consisting of many of the world’s top climate researchers showed that limiting global warming to a maximum 1.5°C above preindustrial levels—the aim of the Paris Agreement on climate—could substantially reduce the likelihood of water stress in some regions, such as the Mediterranean and southern Africa, compared to an unchecked increase in temperature. However, most experts say the Paris accord will not be enough to prevent the most devastating effects of climate change.

What are its impacts on public health and development?

Prolonged water stress can have devastating effects on public health and economic development. More than two billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water; and nearly double that number—more than half the world’s population—are without adequate sanitation services. These deprivations can spur the transmission of diseases such as cholera, typhoid, polio, hepatitis A, and diarrhea.

At the same time, because water scarcity makes agriculture much more difficult, it threatens a community’s access to food. Food-insecure communities can face both acute and chronic hunger, where children are more at risk of conditions stemming from malnutrition, such as stunting and wasting, and chronic illnesses due to poor diet, such as diabetes.

Even if a water-stressed community has stable access to potable water, people can travel great lengths or wait in long lines to get it—time that could otherwise be spent at work or at school. Economists note these all combine [PDF] to take a heavy toll on productivity and development.

How has water factored into international relations?

Many freshwater sources transcend international borders, and, for the most part, national governments have been able to manage these resources cooperatively. Roughly three hundred international water agreements have been signed since 1948. Finland and Russia, for example, have long cooperated on water-management challenges, including floods, fisheries, and pollution. Water-sharing agreements have even persisted through cross-border conflicts about other issues, as has been the case with South Asia’s Indus River and the Jordan River in the Middle East.

However, there are a handful of hot spots where transboundary waters are a source of tension, either because there is no agreement in place or an existing water regime is disputed. One of these is the Nile Basin, where the White and Blue Nile Rivers flow from lakes in East Africa northward to the Mediterranean Sea. Egypt claims the rights to most of the Nile’s water based on several treaties, the first dating back to the colonial era; but other riparian states say they are not bound to the accords because they were never party to them. The dispute has flared in recent years after Ethiopia began construction of a massive hydroelectric dam that Egypt says drastically cuts its share of water.

Transboundary water disputes can also fuel intrastate conflict; some observers note this has increased in recent years, particularly in the hot spots where there are fears of cross-border conflict. For example, a new hydropower project could benefit elites but do little to improve the well-being of the communities who rely on those resources.

Moreover, water stress can affect global flows of goods and people. For instance, wildfires and drought in 2010 wiped out Russian crops, which resulted in a spike in commodities prices and food riots in Egypt and Tunisia at the start of the Arab uprisings. Climate stress is also pushing some to migrate across borders. The United Nations predicts that without interventions in climate change, water scarcity in arid and semi-arid regions will displace hundreds of millions of people by 2030.

What are international organizations and governments doing to alleviate water stress?

There has been some international mobilization around water security. Ensuring the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is one of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a sweeping fifteen-year development agenda adopted by member states in 2015. Smart water management is also vital to many of the other SDGs, such as eliminating hunger and ensuring good health and well-being. And while the Paris Agreement on climate does not refer to water explicitly, the United Nations calls [PDF] water management an “essential component of nearly all the mitigation and adaptation strategies.” The organization warns of the increasing vulnerability of conventional water infrastructure, and points to many climate-focused alternatives, such as coastal reservoirs and solar-powered water systems.

Governments and partner organizations have made progress in increasing access to water services: Between 2000 and 2017, the number of people using safely managed drinking water and safely managed sanitation services rose by 10 percent and 17 percent, respectively. But the pace of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic have presented new challenges. Now, many countries say they are unlikely to implement integrated water management systems by 2030, the target date for fulfilling the SDGs.

Still, some governments are taking ambitious and creative steps to improve their water security that could serve as models for others:

Green infrastructure. Peruvian law mandates that water utilities reinvest a portion of their profits into green infrastructure (the use of plant, soil, and other natural systems to manage stormwater), and Canada and the United States have provided tens of millions of dollars in recent years to support Peru’s efforts [PDF]. Vietnam has taken similar steps to integrate natural and more traditional built water infrastructure.

Wastewater recycling. More and more cities around the globe are recycling sewage water into drinking water, something Namibia’s desert capital has been doing for decades. Facilities in countries including China and the United States turn byproducts from wastewater treatment into fertilizer.

Smarter agriculture. Innovations in areas such as artificial intelligence and genome editing are also driving progress. China has become a world leader in bioengineering crops to make them more productive and resilient.","Water stress or scarcity occurs when demand for safe, usable water in a given area exceeds the supply.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba sailed to victory in the citywide primary elections, easily securing nearly 70% of the total vote, according to unofficial results Tuesday evening.

The margin of victory means Lumumba will head straight to the general election on June 8.

He will now face Jason Wells, who won the Republican primary, and three Independent candidates — Shafeqah ""BigMama"" Lodree, Charlotte Reeves and Les Tannehill.

Lumumba, who is seeking a second term, beat out fellow Democratic candidates Patty Patterson, a longtime community organizer and activist, and Ken Wilson, a former Jackson firefighter.

The incumbent mayor nabbed just over 69% of the total vote, or 13,773 of the 19,887 votes cast for the three mayoral candidates.

Wilson finished with 3,691 votes and Patterson secured 2,423 votes.

In the Republican primary, Wells defeated Ponto Downing with a winning margin of 69%. Wells received 297 votes to Downing's 105 votes.

The vote for Lumumba comes despite two ongoing crises in Jackson, the fallout from a historic water crisis and a continued surge in homicides.

Still, voters said they trusted Lumumba's work over the last four years and believed he would could continue to move the city forward.

Indiah Stinson-Johnson, a 24-year-old Jackson State University student, said she voted for Lumumba to give the mayor a chance to let his agenda play out.

""I think he represents progress,"" she said. ""He's had to deal with a lot of problems since he took office, but I believe he has a plan in place to make the city a better place.""

Poll managers throughout the day said they were seeing a low turnout at the polls. It is not uncommon in Jackson's primary elections, where voters cast their ballots strictly on party lines.

While there were nearly 20,000 ballots cast in the Democratic primaries, only 431 votes were cast in the Republican primary, according to the unofficial results.

Lumumba said on Monday he was hoping for a wide election victory in the primary, and then, the general election.

""I'm looking for a mandate,"" he said.

I‘m grateful to the residents of Jackson and I believe through our collective genius that we will be able to overcome anything that comes our way.

Betty Johnson, the pastor of a Jackson church, knows how important it is to reach out to people in time of need.

Right now, amid the Jackson water crisis that has left some residents without water for more than two weeks following a winter storm, neighbors in south Jackson are helping each other, delivering water.

Last year Johnson, in the northeast part of the city, was dealing with a different kind of water problem — too much of it.

The Pearl River flood of 2020 affected hundreds of Jackson families as the water rose to its third highest crest of 36.67 feet on Feb. 17.

Weeks later, the spotlight on floodwaters shifted to a new disaster — the coronavirus pandemic.

While the outside world wasn't watching, neighbors helped neighbors get through tough times.

""The water came into my house on Feb. 13, 2020,"" said Johnson. ""My house was a total disaster inside.

""Everything had to be gutted out — the floors, everything. I was out of my house until the mid part of June. We didn't receive any assistance. I couldn't get anything. We were on our own like everybody else.""

Going door to door to help others

Johnson, pastor of Planting Seeds Church of Deliverance, also saw what her neighbors were going through.

The church's Planting Seeds Outreach Ministry offers a variety of services including a food pantry. So, Johnson went door to door letting people know they could find help there.

""I gave them a card where they could come to the agency,"" Johnson said. ""We gave out canned goods and meat. We gave out food boxes. We had food drives because a lot of people needed food. We pass out clothes when we have them. We try to give back to the community.""

Danny Harris' Northeast Jackson home where he, his fiancee and four children live flooded, and they moved into a hotel while the home was repaired. He said the hotel was much more expensive than the rent he paid, and to complicate matters more, he lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""It was kind of rough,"" Harris said. ""I ain't going to lie. We was in a hotel for about two months.""

Harris said with no government assistance and the pandemic occupying everyone's attention, he felt forgotten.

""Once COVID hit they forgot about this flood over here,"" Harris said. ""A lot of people forgot about it. You can't be mad because COVID was much worse, but we still had to go through it.""

Harris said some neighbors helped with food and water. Others made donations to help him replace the furniture he lost. He said his church also assisted while he was living in a hotel.

""There's a lot of good people in this neighborhood that I didn't even know,"" Harris said.

Donations, assistance to households

Nicole Claiborne, executive director of the Mississippi Association of Community Action Agencies, also stepped in to coordinate assistance. The situation was presented to the Southeastern Association of Community Action Agencies and the cause was adopted for its annual Jimmy Samuel Day of Service. Donations were made from agencies in seven states to assist some of the affected families.

Claiborne said someone was needed to get applications to affected families, so she connected with Johnson.

""That was a win-win for me,"" Claiborne said. ""She was really the boots on the ground to identify families and connect me with them. She kind of made everything come full circle.""

Claiborne said SEACAA was able to provide financial assistance to 19 households, which included about 70 people.

""It felt so, so good,"" Claiborne said. ""There were gut-wrenching stories of what people had to endure. We just wanted to let them know they were not forgotten.""

Harris' household was among those that received aid. Still unemployed, Harris said the money was needed, but it was also about someone recognizing the plight of the flood victims and remembering them.

""I was grateful for it,"" Harris said. ""I was happy they advocated for us.""

Road engineers getting six hours of sleep all week working to keep major interstates and highways open. Police working overtime to respond to thousands of weather-related traffic accidents.

After the historic 2021 winter storm wrecked the state of Mississippi this week, officials are welcoming the winter weather’s forecast exit on Thursday and reflecting on the week.

“I have worked with (the Mississippi Department of Transportation) over 25 years, and have never seen such an event,” MDOT engineer Mark Holley wrote on Facebook. “Some might say we were not prepared. But in reality, we were more prepared than we have ever been.”

Holley continued: “I sincerely hope that in 25 plus years from now, we are still talking about this event as the ‘worst one ever.'”

The effects of the storm on the state:

• Several state highways remain closed Thursday after many of the state’s major interstates and highways were closed at different points during the week. By Thursday late morning, every major interstate had at least one lane open in both directions.

• At least 250,000 Mississippians lost power at some point during the week, including about 170,000 who were still without power on Thursday late morning.

• Residents in dozens of Mississippi cities and towns are without water or have low water pressure.

• Hundreds of schools and colleges across the state cancelled classes. In the north part of the state, many schools have already announced cancelling classes on Friday.

While the National Weather Service has forecasted that winter precipitation will end across the state by Thursday evening, freezing temperatures could still affects water and electric systems. A hard freeze warning is in effect through Thursday night for much of the state.

“Unlike a hurricane or tornado, where the event comes furiously and then ends, this has been a slow-moving disaster,” Gov. Tate Reeves tweeted on Thursday. “We have been in response mode, not recovery, constantly. There has not been a significant break in the freeze—it just keeps coming.”

146,3 weeks ago,Mississippi Today,Young creatives share why they left Mississippi,"Growing up in Greenwood in the 1980s, Sue Anna Joe was an artsy person.

Joe, 45, remembers The Greenwood Little Theater, a non-profit community theater that is run by volunteers. Despite the theater’s presence, the Delta’s remoteness — it was common for people in Greenwood “to drive down to Jackson” — removed Joe from the hum of city life and new adventures.

“I think as a creative person that I like to try new things and see things from someone else’s perspective,” Joe said.

After working a couple of clerical jobs post-college, a friend recommended web design to Joe. Ultimately, she felt that Mississippi could not provide her the diverse lifestyle nor the higher pay found in other states.

“When I was getting ready to move, I wasn’t really thinking about the graphic design thing, but I wanted to leave for two different choices: I wanted to leave for a place with a bigger variety of lifestyle choices, and I felt that no matter what type of job I got in Mississippi that the pay was going to be kind of low,” she said.

So she left. Today, she’s a front-page web developer in San Francisco. She says California connected her childhood artistic interests to web and graphic design and offered her a reasonable wage for her career.

Joe is among thousands of native Mississippians who have left the state to build careers in arts or other creative fields. The effects of this particular exodus undoubtedly leave a void in one of the state’s most appealing and successful aspects: its arts and culture scene. Dozens of creatives responded to Mississippi Today’s NextGen Mississippi survey and shared why they took their talents to other states.

SURVEY: Tell us why you left Mississippi, why you stayed in Mississippi, and what more you need from Mississippi leaders.

Some creative Mississippians shared experiences of “belonging” when they left the state to pursue their crafts.

“I didn’t feel I was able to be completely open as myself (in Mississippi)”, said Ellice Patterson, a 26-year-old native of Boonesville who now lives in Boston.

Identifying as Black, queer and disabled, Patterson’s latest ballet production, FireBird, which premiered on Zoom on May 14-15, drew on the art administrator’s and director’s personal identity as it comprised a myriad of sub-cultures like BIPOC, LGBTQ and Disability.

However, the executive director and founder of Abilities Dance Boston focused on the conversation FireBird elicits surrounding intersectionality, a term that refers to understanding how a person’s social and political identity creates different modes of discrimination or privilege.

“It was inviting allies and folks who don’t identify with certain communities,” Patterson said. “I believe intersectionality is the key to a better future.”

When asked about creating a production like “FireBird” in Mississippi, Patterson highlighted the “lack of opportunities” and the “lack of support” for creative Mississippians.

“I think there are practical ways that the work can exist, but there’s no real theater,” Patterson said when referring to her hometown of Booneville. “There are no professional dance companies in Mississippi.”

Tony Adams Reimonenq III, a 23-year-old actor from Hattiesburg who now lives in Louisville, Kentucky, described acting as something that makes him “feel like a superhero.”

“What I have gathered is that it has always been my escape,” Reimonenq said. “In real life, I stutter. But when I act, I don’t stutter. So, it empowers me to speak in front of all these people.”

Since he was 3 years old, Reimonenq has acted and credited Mississippi for birthing talented “superheroes” because the state has “a special kind of power” to curate creative people.

But, Reimonenq also acknowledged that the state does not support its creative people in return.

“I knew I was always going to leave Mississippi because just seeing how the arts are supported elsewhere,” Reimonenq shared.

At Oak Grove High School in Hattiesburg, Reminoneq recalled his theater group receiving little funding, while “sports was supported more.” Beyond financial support for artistry, Reminonenq has experienced a sense of genuine community in Louisville.

“When it comes down to true love, empathy or support, everyone will not show that because of political or family backgrounds,” Reminonenq shared when describing the reasons young and older Mississippians are polarized from each other.

However, Reimonenq has hope for Mississippi and plans to open a performing arts theater one day to support upcoming actors and actresses.

“My advice is to cling on to this passion you have for this craft and don’t let your circumstances stop you,” Reimonenq said. “Use your experiences from Mississippi in your craft.”

Hanna Lane Miller, a 30-year-old documentary filmmaker, TV, and film producer from Collins, MS who now lives in Los Angeles, left the state to sharpen her artistic skills.

Previously working as a production assistant at Mississippi Public Broadcasting, Miller’s creative interests eventually transcended into documentary filmmaking, but the aspiring filmmaker sought outside educational opportunities to establish credibility.

“I just knew that if I wanted to have a name or credentials in this industry, then I knew I couldn’t go to a school in Mississippi,” Miller explained.

While Miller acknowledged the value of a Mississippi education, her words like “credentials” and “a name” reflect the sparse education for film and media studies in Mississippi because just four colleges — the University of Mississippi, Millsaps College, University of Southern Miss, and Mississippi University for Women — offer a film and media curriculum.

Additionally, Miller acknowledged the state’s complex history with social justice issues, which the native of Collins connected to hard but rich storytelling in Mississippi.

“While all Southern states are stigmatized, there’s a very special stigma for Mississippi. I think Mississippi particularly has a complex history of social justice,” Miller shared when asked about creating documentaries in Mississippi that deal with social justice issues.

After living in Jackson for just a year, Miller admitted that her short time in the capital city does not grant a current view of Jackson’s artistic community, but the “little interaction between Black and white creators” reflected a divisive atmosphere that still surfaces today.

Even though Miller went to a predominately Black school, she admitted being unaware of the intersection of race, art and politics where she recalled Black friends who entered majority-white, artistic spaces in Jackson.

Now, the 30-year-old documentary filmmaker recognized that “we have to be set on stepping out of our comfort zone” to bridge the gap between misunderstanding and collaboration.

Other creative Mississippians reflected on the lack of state support for Jackson, the capital city and state’s only large metropolitan area that serves as a cultural hub. They shared nuanced emotions towards the city itself and state leaders’ policies that drive young creatives out of the state.

“I’ve always wanted to support Jackson; I’ve never wanted it to fail, but people don’t want to invest in Jackson. They treat it like a lost cause,” said Maggie Hubbard, a 24-year-old Brandon and Flowood native who is now a graphic designe and animator in New York City.

Acknowledging that New York City is not perfect, Hubbard’s ability to find more jobs as a graphic designer, hear “different languages,” and “see many different types of art” — aspects that continued during the pandemic — appealed to her.

“All of the measures they took to make life bearable really stuck with people,” Hubbard explained, contrasting the divisive political leadership surrounding the Jackson water crisis during the pandemic.

All of the young creatives interviewed for this piece expressed hope for Mississippi.

Annsley McRae, a 25-year-old event coordinator and Tishomingo native who now lives in Nashville, looks forward to creating more events in Mississippi one day and acknowledged she “could quite have the market share in Mississippi” based on what she knows now about the state.

Other creative Mississippians like Miller have found a way to contribute their talents to the state from afar; Miller is currently working on her first Mississippi-based feature film that examines “a sense of belonging.”

“My advice for anyone who wants to be the best in this field is to leave Mississippi but to come back,” Miller said. “I still love Mississippi a lot, and the one thing about Mississippi I love when I work there is that I know exactly who I am and why I’m there because in Mississippi there’s no getting lost.”

Recent water woes show it's about time | Opinion Severe winter weather proved how vulnerable water pipes in Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas are to failure. It's time to do something about it.

President Joe Biden has vowed to address the country’s crumbling water infrastructure, but the recent winter storms prove Americans must take water safety into their own hands.

Americans in Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee were advised to boil drinking water after pipelines froze and burst, leaving tap water unsafe to consume. Many were forced to stand in long lines hoping to get a case of water from the National Guard or Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Jackson, Mississippi, reported 96 water main breaks and leaks that left at least 40,000 homes without running water for weeks.

Mississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, whose family was without water for more than two weeks, blamed the city’s crumbling pipelines. ""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,” Crudup said. “This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Residents in Memphis faced a similar experience. According to the Associated Press, boil water advisories across the city affected over 250,000 customers after pipes, including some that hadn’t been replaced since the 1930s, burst. Even after the advisory was lifted, some say their water looked “muddy” and gave off a foul odor. The county continued to provide bottled water across 20 distribution sites for weeks.

Nearly 15 million Texans—about half the state's population—were without access to clean drinking water at the peak of the water crisis on Feb. 19. Not only did freezing temperatures cause water main breaks, but widespread power outages forced water treatment plants offline.

And even after the worst of the storm passed, problems still lingered. As of March 1, approximately 390,000 Texans were still being told to boil their water.

A break every two minutes

According to the American Society of Civil Engineer’s 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, America’s aging water systems experience an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 water main breaks each year. That’s equivalent to one break every two minutes. Hundreds of thousands of people are sickened by bad water daily.

Biden has vowed to invest $3 trillion into renovating our country’s crumbling infrastructure—including eliminating aging lead pipes and upgrading water quality monitoring technologies.

This plan will expand on current grant programs managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including one 2020 program that awarded over $17 million to provide training and technical assistance to small public water and wastewater systems.

A nationwide fix won’t happen overnight. Biden took a good first step by meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office to discuss infrastructure. But his plan could face an uphill battle in the Senate. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, said he will block the $3 trillion package if Republicans are not included in the conversation. We could be looking at weeks, months or even years before a proper infrastructure bill sees the light of day—and even then, it'll take years to fix everything.

Stay prepared

For the foreseeable future, families need to protect themselves. FEMA recommends families store a gallon of bottled water, per person, per day with enough water for a two-week supply. Additionally, families should look up their local water utility’s test results online to see if their tap water meets health guidelines during normal times.

A fluid ounce of prevention is worth a gallon of cure.

149,1 month ago,WJTV,Neighbors advised against recreation in Jackson waterways,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — People are being advised for the third year in a row to avoid swimming, fishing and other recreational activities in the river and creeks in Mississippi’s capital city, after a recent evaluation from the state environmental agency.

The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality issued a water quality advisory for 11 Jackson creeks and areas of the Pearl River near the city’s Savanna Wastewater Treatment Plant in south Jackson, The Clarion Ledger reported.

The advisory is the result of wastewater overflows from the plant and sewer infrastructure problems across the city, officials say.

Many of Jackson’s water and sewer pipes are old and need to be replaced. Overflows can be caused by excessive water flow, collapsed pipes and the dumping of fats, oils and greases into the system.

Excessive rain is also an issue. A record rainfall the first three months of 2020 overflowed the city’s sewage system and dumped minimally treated sewage into the Pearl River. Overflow problems occurred again from January to March this year.

The department said it is collecting water samples and monitoring water quality.","The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality issued a water quality advisory for 11 Jackson creeks and areas of the Pearl River near the city’s Savanna Wastewater Treatment Plant in south Jackson, The Clarion Ledger reported.

In mid-March of 2020, Cassandra Rollins was out shopping with her 38-year-old daughter, Shalondra, when the younger Ms. Rollins complained of head pains and body aches. Despite the growing COVID-19 pandemic, Cassandra said, Shalondra’s doctor diagnosed her with the flu and sent her home with antibiotics. Only when a friend of Shalondra’s tested positive for the novel coronavirus was Shalondra herself able to get a test. She, too, had the infection.

On the morning of April 7, Shalondra had difficulty breathing and collapsed in the shower of her Jackson, Miss., apartment. Her 12-year-old daughter, who has asthma, used her own inhaler to try to help her mother breathe.

The responding ambulance was driving so slowly that Cassandra became stuck behind it and honked at it to speed up. When the paramedics drove Shalondra to hospital, the elder Ms. Rollins said, they did not turn on lights or sirens to make an emergency run.

Within the hour, the hospital called Cassandra. Her daughter had died on a gurney in the hallway.

Shalondra Rollins, an assistant teacher who worked with special needs children at an elementary school, was the first person in Jackson to die of COVID-19. Her case foreshadowed the trends that would soon come to define the pandemic in the United States: Black, diabetic, with a low-income childhood in public housing and, according to her family, difficulty with the health care system.

Over the past year, in addition to grieving, Cassandra has struggled with the pandemic’s effects. Herself a substitute teacher, she has been off work since Jackson’s schools closed last spring. Even when they were reopened in the autumn, Ms. Rollins felt it wasn’t safe to go back.

Earlier this month, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves ended all physical-distancing restrictions and lifted the state’s mask mandate, making public places even more fraught.

Ms. Rollins also has diabetes and does not have health insurance coverage, meaning a brush with COVID-19 could be financially ruinous if not deadly.

So she has had to mostly stay home. She has avoided seeing friends and cut back on seeing family. She spends her time raising Shalondra’s teenaged daughters and setting up vaccination appointments for senior citizens who have trouble navigating the state’s sign-up portal.

“When they post the death toll, I know my daughter’s in it,” Ms. Rollins, 57, said. “It’s been really hard on me, being locked in my house, thinking about the two kids, thinking about the pandemic. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad days.”

Mississippi has been one of the places hit hardest by COVID-19. Its 7,000 deaths in a population of three million gives it the fifth-highest death rate among U.S. states, ahead of pandemic hot spots such as Arizona and South Dakota, and behind only the densely populated U.S. Northeast. Despite this, it has received scant attention, often ignored by a national media hyperfocused on more populous locales.

But understanding what has gone so catastrophically wrong in the country’s poorest state helps explain why the U.S. as a whole has utterly failed to deal with the pandemic.

Racial and social inequality, a broken health care system and political divisions over the response to COVID-19 have all marked the past year in Mississippi.

In recent weeks, meanwhile, Jackson, the state’s capital and largest city, has also dealt with a debilitating water crisis. A winter storm wreaked havoc on an aging infrastructure, turning off the taps for almost all residents, and leaving them under a boil-water advisory for a full month. The disaster offered another abject lesson in how dysfunctional the world’s wealthiest country can still be at handling matters of basic public health.

“It’s being brought into focus just how inequitable our society is, how disparate the effect of these types of traumas are on our communities,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told The Globe and Mail. “We’ve been fixing the bike while we’ve been riding it.”

Open this photo in gallery Vaccination day in Mississippi: At top, vehicles line up at a vaccination site in Jackson's eastern suburb of Pearl, and at bottom, registered nurse Michelle Owens administers a shot to Billy Garner at a health centre across town. Mass vaccination sites in rural and suburban Mississippi have received more resources than at-risk communities in inner cities.

One recent Saturday morning, a steady stream of people lined up at the Central United Methodist Church in downtown Jackson for a pop-up COVID-19 vaccination clinic. Greeting them at the door was volunteer Robert Pugh, a 77-year-old retiree who used to run the association representing the state’s non-profit health care centres.

Mississippi’s inoculation rollout has primarily relied on mass, drive-through vaccination sites. The only two in the Jackson area are at suburban ballparks.

On many days, there are no open appointments at either of them, while vaccination sites in more distant, rural counties have thousands of available slots.

Mr. Pugh himself ran up against this problem in January. It took two weeks of refreshing Mississippi’s vaccine sign-up portal before he finally found an appointment. It was another week and a half before his first shot. Hence the need for the clinic at Central Methodist, where people could walk in off the street and get the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a matter of minutes.

“We’re trying to get the sites closer to the communities most exposed, to the communities in need,” Mr. Pugh said.

“This has been one of the challenges of the distribution: getting sites set up in the inner city.”

Open this photo in gallery It took weeks for Robert Pugh, 77, to get a vaccination appointment.

These sorts of inequities have marked the course of the pandemic, both in Mississippi and nationally.

This state is the poorest in the U.S., with a per capita income less than half that of Washington, D.C., the country’s wealthiest jurisdiction. It has some of the highest rates of heart disease, obesity and diabetes. All of these conditions track poverty and, in part, are related to the inability to afford to eat healthy. They also make it more likely that the sufferer, should he or she contract COVID-19, will get seriously ill.

Mississippi also has the highest proportion of Black residents of any state, at 38 per cent. Nationally, African-Americans are nearly twice as likely as white people to die from COVID-19. At one point last spring, Black Mississippians represented a staggering 72 per cent of the state’s death rate.

Experts have proffered a range of explanations for such discrepancies. Black people in the U.S. are more likely to face poverty and chronic health conditions. They are more likely to work in front-line jobs that don’t allow for physical distancing. And when they do encounter the health care system, Black Americans are less likely to receive the right treatment.

Chevalye Alexander, 26, said his grandfather was in and out of hospital in Canton, Miss., an industrial town near Jackson, with COVID-19 in October. His case was so severe that he couldn’t get up to tend his garden. “They said he was good to go back home. And later on that night, he ended up dying in the bed,” said Mr. Alexander, who is Black, as he sold paintings at a shopping centre in Jackson.

Nearly 13 per cent of Mississippians have no health insurance, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than four times the rate in Massachusetts, which has the country’s most comprehensive coverage.

The Republican-run state has repeatedly refused to join a federal program under the Affordable Care Act to expand Medicaid, a government plan that provides health insurance to the lowest-income Americans. Signing on to the Medicaid expansion would cover up to 300,000 more Mississippians.

Robin Johnson, 34, can’t afford health insurance on the money she scrapes together from freelance jobs as a social-media manager, illustrator and art gallery guide. She estimates that her hourly pay works out to between US$10 and US$12. She worries about the enormous hospital bills she could be stuck with if she were to contract the virus.

“I try to stay in as much as possible and not get sick. Because I know if I were to fall ill, I don’t have any kind of backup plan,” she said.

Making matters worse, the state was hit in February by the same winter tempest that shut down the electricity grid in Texas. The subzero temperatures froze the pumps at Jackson’s water treatment plants and caused aging pipes to burst under city streets. The crisis made the city’s entire water supply unsafe to drink for the next month.

Greg Morgan, a 63-year-old mental-health worker, said he took to putting out five-gallon rain buckets and boiling water on the stove before every use. Ms. Johnson relied on bottled water to brush her teeth and make coffee. Mr. Pugh had to wash clothes by hand in his kitchen sink.

In a state that only removed the Confederate battle flag from its insignia earlier this year, pandemic politics have also broken down largely along racial lines.

Story continues below advertisement

By last fall, the disparity between Black and white COVID-19 death numbers in Mississippi had largely vanished. Asked to explain the reversal, State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs told reporters that Black Mississippians were more vigilant about following public-health precautions than their white counterparts.

In last year’s presidential election, 81 per cent of white Mississippians voted for Donald Trump, who took an often laissez-faire attitude toward the pandemic, while 94 per cent of Black voters cast ballots for Joe Biden, who campaigned on a nationwide mask mandate.

Representing this gulf locally are Mr. Reeves, the Governor, on one side and Mr. Lumumba, the Jackson mayor, on the other. The state as a whole is solidly Republican; Jackson, with a more than 80-per-cent Black population, is a Democratic stronghold.

Mr. Reeves, a white Republican who resembles a heavyset version of Bill Gates, has taken a light touch on physical distancing. In September, he allowed the state’s mask mandate to expire. Forced to reimpose it after cases spiked a few weeks later, he lifted the mandate again this month. At the same time, Mr. Reeves also allowed businesses to fully reopen. “The governor’s office is getting out of the business of telling people what they can and cannot do,” he declared.

Mr. Lumumba, by contrast, is a Black Democrat who endorsed Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign. Holding press conferences in skinny jeans and slim-cut sport coats, he gives off a distinctly hipster vibe. And he has repeatedly tried to keep pandemic safety measures in place locally after the state has ended them, including by ordering his own mask mandate for the city.

Open this photo in gallery Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba sits in his office beside a picture of his father, a former mayor.

The two levels of government have also fought over the water crisis. Mr. Lumumba contends that years of underinvestment in the system would cost US$2-billion to fix, money the city does not have. Mr. Reeves’s deputy, Delbert Hosemann, meanwhile, has argued Jackson did a better job maintaining water infrastructure when it was run by a white mayor.

In an interview, Mr. Lumumba framed both the pandemic and water crisis as expressions of the same problem.

“Whether it’s a failed infrastructure, whether it’s the disproportionate effect on Black and brown communities of the pandemic, these are things that have revealed the conditioning and the state that we have been in for quite some time,” he said as he walked to his office in Jackson’s neoclassical City Hall.

“We have to be able to shift our metrics of success, of government success, of national and local economies, from simply looking at GDP or the stock market or whether we’re building nice buildings, and move it toward sustainable development.”

Jackson’s struggle with poverty and urban decline is readily visible.

Around the state legislature, there are nearly as many surface parking lots as there are buildings. Many residential neighbourhoods are dotted with abandoned strip malls and burnt-out or demolished houses. On some blocks, dilapidated homes have been nearly swallowed by vegetation under towering elm and magnolia trees, giving the effect of the forest reclaiming the city. Along Farish Street, the inner-city thoroughfare that includes Central United, dozens of historic brick commercial buildings are boarded up.

As she stood outside the church after receiving her vaccine, Andrana Rankins, a university biology student, said COVID-19 never had to get this bad. Currently working on a school co-op program in a nursing home, she has seen the psychological toll on pensioners unable to see their families.

“The social distancing has not been as good as it could have been – we have a governor who is not requiring masks. Not expanding Medicaid was a very selfish decision,” Ms. Rankins, 20, said.

“We’ve been in this pandemic for a year now, and I feel like it should never have lasted this long.”

Open this photo in gallery Downtown Jackson is framed through an opening in an abandoned building. Mississippi's winter storm in February, the same one that froze Texas, damaged Jackson's aging water infrastructure, leaving residents under a boil-water advisory for a month.

Trish Tidmore, like Cassandra Rollins, has been out of work for the past year. Ms. Tidmore, 36, had to quit her job as an administrator at a hospice last spring to stay home with her six-year-old son when his school closed. After the education system reopened in the fall, she couldn’t find work.

Her family, which also includes her husband, Curtis Linton, 39, and a teenaged daughter, has had to rely solely on Mr. Linton’s income as a pipe layer to get by.

They’ve cut back on groceries, starting a vegetable garden to supplement their meals. Where they used to visit their extended families, who live several hours away, two or three times a month, they now only make the trek every three or four months – the gas is just too expensive. On a couple of occasions, they said, they nearly had to give up their car because they could no longer afford it.

But unlike Ms. Rollins, Ms. Tidmore blames the situation not on COVID-19 itself but on the physical-distancing measures used to combat it. She believes in a Trump-fuelled conspiracy theory that government agencies are inflating the death toll.

“We don’t believe it’s a pandemic,” she said one overcast afternoon last week as she and Mr. Linton stood, unmasked, watching their son climb on a piece of play equipment at an outlet mall in Pearl, Miss., a suburb of Jackson. “We made the solution worse than the virus itself. The death numbers are not accurate.”

Ms. Tidmore and Mr. Linton also do not plan to get vaccinated because they believe it is ineffective. Instead, the couple said, they are relying on vitamins to keep them from contracting the virus. “Everybody needs to calm down and go on with life,” Mr. Linton said.

Rankin County, where Ms. Tidmore and Mr. Linton live, lies directly across the Pearl River from Jackson. Demographically, it is the city’s opposite. Its population is 74-per-cent white and it has a median household income of US$66,000, almost double Jackson’s. Solidly Republican, Rankin gave Mr. Trump 72 per cent of its vote. It’s the sort of place where even those who have seen the pandemic’s ravages firsthand support ending coronavirus containment measures.

Ron Johnson, a 37-year-old powerline technician, buried both his stepmother and her mother the week after Christmas. They contracted COVID-19 at a beauty salon. But he’s happy to see the mask mandate and other restrictions go.

“I think if you’re going to get it, you’re going to get it, it’s your time,” he said, tugging his blue surgical mask down under his nose, as he shopped with his grandmother at an outlet mall. “I can’t breathe with this on. I don’t like it.”

Mr. Johnson dismissed the notion that a lack of health care coverage is one of the reasons for the high death toll in Mississippi. “It’s just lazy people, people who don’t want to work, people who want free things in life,” he said. “You give them a car, they want a house.”

Despite Mr. Reeves’s efforts to fully reopen, many businesses around Jackson and its suburbs – including most of the shops in the outlet mall – still required masks. Others limited the number of people allowed inside at once.

But in some places, you could almost imagine there was no pandemic on at all. One recent Friday night in Fondren, a hip neighbourhood in north Jackson, the restaurants were full, with diners and drinkers sitting in close proximity and crowding around the bar.

It’s the sort of scene that fills Ms. Rollins with dread. Just last week her youngest daughter, 27-year-old Tabitha, also tested positive for COVID-19. It was another reminder that the pandemic is still not over. And Ms. Rollins wishes everyone would take it as seriously as she does, to avoid the toll it’s taken on her family.

“I see them in clubs, packed, no mask,” she said. “And nobody’s doing anything about it.”","Despite the growing COVID-19 pandemic, Cassandra said, Shalondra’s doctor diagnosed her with the flu and sent her home with antibiotics.
Even when they were reopened in the autumn, Ms. Rollins felt it wasn’t safe to go back.
“When they post the death toll, I know my daughter’s in it,” Ms. Rollins, 57, said.

(WJTV) – Many neighbors in Jackson have been without water for nine days after last week’s winter storms. They are left to rely on the donations of strangers for bottled water, and they have to wait in long lines for non-drinking water to use around the house.

“It’s hard because you have to wash your dishes, brush your teeth, and trying to boil all this water is very difficult,” said one neighbor.

The Mississippi National Guard stationed 45,000 gallon tanks with non-drinking water at four locations in the city. Neighbors can bring as many containers as they need to take care of basic needs.

In addition to filling up containers, guardsmen are also handing out masks and jugs of hand sanitizer.

“I am so glad and so thankful for that the Lord is blessing them to help us out,” said a neighbor.

No matter how long it takes to fix the water, the guard members said they’ll be ready to help.","(WJTV) – Many neighbors in Jackson have been without water for nine days after last week’s winter storms.

154,"Mar 25, 2021",WLBT,"‘When I mess up, I fess up’: Jackson mayor sends correction to New York Times","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba recently sent a correction to the New York Times, days after telling the New York Times that the state doesn’t pay water bills to the city.

The correction ran on the national publication’s website on March 24, days after he corrected himself at his weekly press conference.

A copy of the correction is shown below.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba corrected his statements to the New York Times that the state did not pay the city for water services. (WLBT)

“I was armed with the incorrect information. I think I made the statement that the state doesn’t pay a bill,” he said. “There have been some time periods in which there were some inconsistencies in those bill payments, and they do pay a bill.

“I always intend to give correct information and when I mess up, I fess up,” he said.

During the height of the city’s recent water crisis, the mayor said the city would be in better financial shape if the state paid water bills.

However, local blog site Jackson Jambalaya uncovered that the state does pay bills, something that WLBT has confirmed through its own open record request.

Documents obtained by WLBT showed that the Department of Finance and Administration paid more than $2.9 million in water usage fees to the city between 2016 and 2020. Those amounts cover water usage at many of the state-owned properties in the Capitol Complex, including the Mississippi State Capitol.

The amounts do not include other individual state agencies, which are paid to the city directly by those agencies, DFA officials say.

The mayor said that despite the mistake, his point behind the erroneous statements still stands.

“The city of Jackson is the largest city by the factor of three. We provide fire and police protection to the state and unlike many other capital cities, we don’t get a payment in lieu of taxes to accommodate (us) for the lost revenue we experience because of state properties not being taxed,” he said.

State-owned properties are not subject to ad valorem taxes. The city, though, still provides fire and police protection to those facilities, the mayor explained.

Many states have put in place PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes, programs to compensate cities for the loss of property tax revenue associated with tax-exempt properties.

Mississippi has not established a PILOT program, per se, but has set up a “Capitol Complex Improvement District,” and provides an annual allocation to cover some public projects within it.

Lawmakers approved the district years ago. It takes in a large swath of the capital city, including many state-owned facilities.

The allocation is provided annually specifically to help the city offset the costs for providing police and fire protection and for paving roads and repairing other infrastructure serving those buildings.

According to state statute, a portion of the annual sales taxes generated in the city goes to that district. This year, about $11 million is expected to be allocated for work within the area.

However, those funds are controlled by DFA, and projects chosen for funding are similarly determined by the agency.

The state of Mississippi would see billions of dollars for a wide range of infrastructure projects under a recently unveiled plan from the White House.

Under President Joe Biden’s American Jobs Plan, the White House is proposing about $2.3 trillion in infrastructure funding and other improvements across the country.

The upgrade and repair of city, county and state water infrastructure is among the priorities of the plan, according to the White House which says it is committed to investing about $4.8 billion in the state for that purpose over the next 20 years. It also says it will pump another $50 billion to states to protect infrastructure from extreme weather events.

The details of the plan — broken down by state — were released Monday by the White House and are based, in part, on last year's annual report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which gave the state a grade of D+ on infrastructure.

""Over the past 15 years, our infrastructure systems have faced numerous, unprecedented challenges in the form of hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts and floods. ...To continue to raise, retain and attract the best and brightest, Mississippi must invest in strategic infrastructure efforts,"" the American Society of Civil Engineers report concluded.

The plan covers several infrastructure-related projects in the state, such as investments in roads and bridges, public transportation and broadband. It also promises investment in other public programs, including housing, caregiving, child care, manufacturing and veteran health.

The plan announcement comes as city of Jackson officials continue to scramble to secure millions of dollars in funding to fix the city's outdated water treatment and distribution system. A list of deficiencies at the plant led to the city's worst water crisis in recent memory, leading to a water shortage for most water customers and a boil notice that lasted about a month.

The plan would also invest $600 billion in the nation's roads and bridges, noting over 1,300 bridges and over 5,800 miles of roads in Mississippi are considered in poor condition.

Another $289 million is needed for schools, according to the White House report. Nearly a quarter of households in the state lack an internet subscription, and a similar percentage live in areas without broadband. The report stated Mississippians who use public transportation devote an extra 87.7% of their time to commuting, USA Today reported.

Republican lawmakers have been quick to reject the proposal from Biden, saying just a fraction of the spending goes to traditional infrastructure, according to USA TODAY.

“This is a massive social welfare spending program combined with a massive tax increase on small-business job creators,” U.S. Sen. Roger Wicker said recently on ABC’s “This Week.” Wicker is a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee.

“I can’t think of a worse thing to do,"" he said.

Republican Mike Ezell, who has been sheriff of Jackson County since 2014, is running for Congress in Mississippi’s 4th congressional district — a seat currently held by Rep. Steven Palazzo.

Ezell will formally kick off his campaign in a four-stop tour on Wednesday in Jackson, Harrison, Forrest and Jones counties. The election will be held in 2022.

Palazzo has been the subject of a House ethics investigation for allegedly misspending campaign funds. A congressional ethics report made public in March alleged that Palazzo misspent campaign and congressional funds, and said it found evidence he used his office to help his brother and used staff for personal errands and services.

What’s next for Palazzo remains unclear as the House Ethics Committee could dismiss the allegations, offer its own rebuke of Palazzo, or pass the matter off for criminal investigation to the Department of Justice. The congressman, who has denied wrongdoing, has not yet filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run for reelection in 2022.

The impacts of winter storms and a historic cold snap that took place well over two weeks ago are continuing to be felt for a large population across the South, as infrastructure systems largely unprepared for the cold are still recovering from the massive blow.

Hundreds of thousands are still without clean water in their homes as a result of winter ... [+] storms--weeks after the record cold snap. getty

Key Facts

Between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi—the states most impacted in terms of water—more than 250,000 people remain without direct access to clean water in homes, either due to water outages or boil water advisories. In Jackson, Mississippi, more than half of schools remained closed for in-person learning due to inadequate water pressure. Officials in the city do not know how many residents still have water outages and do not know when those outages might be restored. There are still even some without power from the winter storms, though most are far from Texas, where millions went without electricity in the record cold. More than 1,000 customers remain without power in areas of southern West Virginia, some of whom have gone without electricity since an ice storm on Feb. 11, during the first in a series of major winter storms to hit the South, days before the largest of the storms devastated Texas. Restoration efforts for the small pockets without power have been slowed because of flooding in recent days.

Key Background

A series of winter storms bringing snow, ice and record cold hit large swaths of the South over the course of about a week during mid-February, bringing some areas that can go years without snow and ice multiple events in just a matter of days. By far the most widespread impacts were in Texas, where the state's electric grid was pushed to the brink of total failure, leading to rolling blackouts that left millions in the dark and without access to heat during cold temperatures which in many cases broke records that had stood for over a century.

What To Watch For

The mass outages in Texas are now subject to investigations on both the state and federal levels. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) on Feb. 19, while House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) sent a letter to ERCOT CEO Bill Magness Wednesday requesting documents relating to its winter weather preparedness.

Surprising Fact

Temperatures quickly rebounded after the deep freeze. Some areas that dealt with record lows and days of temperatures mostly below freezing had highs in the 80s just over a week later.

Tuesday update:

The risk of severe weather was raised in parts of northern Mississippi on Tuesday going into Wednesday, with the possibility of strong, long-track damaging wind gusts and hail up to golf-ball size or larger, according to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center.

""That's pretty significant,"" said Ashlyn Jackson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson. ""It's kind of rating a 4 out of 5 for severity, but the same threat is still up high.""

The window of time for the most severe weather activity will be from 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. Wednesday in northern Mississippi and from noon to midnight in the surrounding areas, she said.

Jackson said while the northern area of the state has been raised to a moderate risk level, the rest of the state should stay on alert, even in areas where the risk has diminished.

""There are the same threats, but there is more of a certainty and that risk is just a little bit more,"" she said. ""We're still remaining diligent in conveying that. It's going to be more widespread.""

The Jackson metro area is still at the enhanced-risk level and the risk level for southern Mississippi was lowered to slight. But that doesn't mean south Mississippi is out of the woods as far as dangerous storms go, Jackson said.

""Whatever the threat level you're put in, still take the threat warning seriously because the risk is possible for all of our county-warning area,"" she said.

Weather forecast: Storms taking aim at Mississippi could bring strong tornadoes

Original story:

A round of severe weather that began moving through Mississippi on Monday is expected to make an even bigger impact on the state later in the week.

""Everywhere in our area we're looking at threats of severe weather on Wednesday,"" said Logan Poole, meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson.

He said a low-level band of storms moved through the state on Monday ""which will be one of the focal points for our weather on Wednesday.""

A band of stronger storms with gusty winds is moving across central Mississippi this morning. Here, you can see the leading edge of a shelf cloud moving across KJAN.



This band will likely continue to produce gusty winds as it moves east; isolated severe storms possible. pic.twitter.com/7hFRSiwXQo — NWS Jackson MS (@NWSJacksonMS) March 15, 2021

Monday's shallow band of squalls that moved to the south is expected to return to the north late Tuesday or early Wednesday and surge back to the north as a warm front, he said.

""As it happens, it's going to bring all moisture and warmth back with it,"" Poole said. ""That band of storms is going to sink to the south and probably stall out somewhere across Southern Mississippi or along the Gulf Coast.""

When that storm system returns northward, it is expected to clash with an incoming upper-level system.

""We have a pretty coated weather system in the middle or the upper level of the atmosphere at the same time, and that's going to create some wind shear and increased instability when coupled with that frontal boundary that's coming to the north,"" Poole said. ""We could see some pretty vigorous thunderstorms or possibly some severe thunderstorms.""

Residents should be prepared with more than one way to stay on top of weather events, Mississippi Emergency Management officials said on Twitter.

Poole said the state could see ""most every pattern possible with severe weather,"" including hail, wind, brief heavy rainfall and the possibility of tornadoes, some of which have the potential to be strong.

""We're going to have to keep a really close eye on that,"" Poole said. ""It's going to be one of the higher-end severe-weather events we've seen so far this year.""

He said Mississippians should be prepared for severe weather ahead of Wednesday's event, especially in the eastern and southern portions of the state on Monday and Tuesday.

""While we are focused on Wednesday, do be aware that there could be strong storms around for the remainder of today and tomorrow as well,"" Poole said. ""Don't get too much tunnel vision set on Wednesday.""

162,"Feb 19, 2021",The Portland Press Herald,Water crisis worsens for Southern cities hit hard by storms,"AUSTIN, Texas — Southern cities slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Busted water pipes ruptured by record-low temperatures created shortages of clean drinking water, shut down the Memphis airport on Friday and left hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.

In Texas, 7 million people – a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state – were under orders to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Restaurants that can’t do so or don’t have bottled water were ordered to close. And water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights.

In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.

“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.

Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a half hours after he arrived.

“We need water, the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have,” Davis said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week, forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.

Texas electrical grid operators said Friday that transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up homes – buckling the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.

Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power. About 60,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 70 people, including people struggling to get warm and a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning.”

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Friday afternoon, more than 1,300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.

More than 1 million gallons of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director, Greg Maszaros, implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”

In Dallas, David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.

“It’s pretty much first come, first served,” said Lopez, as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”

Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals, but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled, spokeswoman Gale Smith said.

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled water and bagged ice for all consumption and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building – causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skink lizard.

More than 192,000 Louisiana residents – some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura – had no water service Friday, according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.

In the community of Hackberry, near Lake Charles, Louisiana, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.

164,"Mar 9, 2021",NBC News,Shalanda Baker and the energy crisis plaguing Black and brown Americans,"Recovery efforts still continue weeks after a winter storm plunged the Southern states into below-zero temperatures and buried them in inches of ice. Jackson, Mississippi, still doesn't have running water. Texans have wiped out their savings to pay skyrocketing utility bills. In Dallas, the mayor said the full death toll from the storm may never be known.

Low-income communities and communities of color have historically been hit hardest by natural disasters. But climate and energy justice advocates argue that it's not just after storms when the communities suffer. The energy system — from rate design that determines utility costs to polluted air in certain ZIP codes — has been designed in a way that harms the communities disproportionately every day.

""These are choices. There's nothing inevitable about how you set things up,"" said Shalanda Baker, the deputy director for energy justice at the U.S. Energy Department.

""As we reckon with structural racism across so many domains in our society, the structural racism, structural inequality, that is just baked into the energy system should also be examined,"" she said, ""We just haven't begun to interrogate it, but, I mean, I would ask why wouldn't the energy system suffer from the same inequality that so many other aspects of our society suffer from?""

To examine the country's energy system and its intersection with equity is why Baker was appointed.

The Energy Department has never before had a director focused on energy justice, but the Biden administration has made commitments to enhance work on climate change, racial inequity and the Covid-19 pandemic. Baker's work sits at the crossroads of all three issues.

When he signed executive orders to tackle climate change in January, Biden said, ""Environmental justice will be at the center of all we do addressing the disproportionate health and environmental and economic impacts on communities of color — so-called fence-line communities.""

Others who work in the energy justice field, like Subin DeVar, who co-founded the Initiative for Energy Justice with Baker in 2017, said Baker's role at the Energy Department ""connected all of the dots.""

""The pandemic, I think, magnified for a lot of people the intersection of health and pollution,"" DeVar said. ""The last 30 years, the concept of environmental justice was definitely a substantial field of study, but the ordinary American probably hadn't heard about the concept of environmental justice. They probably weren't aware of the fact that you could link someone's ZIP code and race to certain health factors.""

Now, DeVar said, ""we're talking about places where there's elevated pollution and spaces where there's higher instances of respiratory illness and how that's tied to the energy system.""

Texas' energy crisis during the pandemic is just one example. When the state's power grid failed, leaving millions of people without electricity in freezing temperatures, low-income communities and communities of color were affected disproportionately.

Some people were able to use heat from their cars and trucks as temperatures plunged, but that meant spending money on gas. Pipes burst in several homes, leading to flooding, which also requires money for necessary, often costly repairs. On top of that, Black communities are 75 percent more likely to be in fence-line communities, which can include oil refineries. In the cold temperatures, the refineries have shut down — and in the process, they release even more pollutants in the air.

While all of those issues were the result of the snowstorm, experts like Baker said the existing infrastructure works against those communities daily.

For example, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy reported in a 2016 study that some low-income households spend up to 20 percent of their household incomes on their utility bills. For high-income households, the number is as low as 2 percent.

The wide gap in income spent on energy means steps like installing solar panels — which helps save even more on energy costs — are accessible only to those who have the financial resources in the first place.

It's a cycle of inequity. So when disaster hits, Baker sees an opportunity not just to fix things as they are, but also to rebuild with the goal of combating inequity at the forefront, she said.

""We're in a fork in the road. We can choose to harden the existing centralized infrastructure or we take the other path, which is to think about things like microgrids, things like innovating, to make communities more resilient,"" Baker said.

The silver lining is that with the rise in climate emergencies the country has experienced, there has been a far greater sense of urgency to act and innovate in constructing energy solutions — on a local level and now a federal level, too.

""I think in the next three years or so, at least in this administration, we're going to see the rapid deployment of new technology and clean technology ... a lot of testing out of the fastest ways to do this. And I'm hoping, if I have anything to say about it, the most just way to do this,"" she said.

The new role at the Energy Department is Baker's first government job.

Before she even worked in the field of energy justice, Baker was an officer in the Air Force — in 2001, she was honorably discharged under the defunct ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, which barred lesbian, gay and bisexual service members from serving openly — before she became a project finance lawyer and worked on bankruptcy issues in Japan. Eventually, she landed in Oaxaca, Mexico, where she had her ""lightning bolt"" moment working with indigenous communities that were fighting developments of large-scale wind farms.

""I realized, oh, my gosh, if we're relying on the same logics and approaches and stakeholders in our clean energy transition as we relied on in our fossil fuel transition, we're really going to replicate inequality that is existing in our system, and so that sort of started me down the rabbit hole,"" she said.

She went on to become a professor at the University of Hawaii, where she co-founded the founded the Energy Justice Program, the predecessor to the Initiative on Energy Justice. This year, she published a book, ""Revolutionary Power,"" about changing the energy system to benefit underserved communities. (She also played in the women's Rugby World Cup.)

""I'm a sort of a unicorn,"" Baker said, ""I think we need people in the administration who can talk to so many different stakeholders and wear a lot of different hats to be able to execute on this agenda.""

But in all the hats she has worn in her career, Baker said, it took her years before she realized she had a personal connection with the structural racism, specifically anti-Black racism, within the energy system.

After Hurricane Harvey, which ravaged eastern Texas along the Gulf of Mexico in 2017, Baker was watching a Facebook Live video from Port Arthur, Texas. A young man was begging for help, saying the water was up to his knees.

Port Arthur, which Baker describes as ""the epicenter of the country's fossil fuel system,"" is where her father's family is from. The man in the video was her brother.

""That was the moment when I decided that I would write a little bit about Port Arthur,"" Baker said.

The population of Port Arthur, part of the ""Golden Triangle"" — ""golden"" because of all the gas flares from the oil refineries — is predominantly Black. The cancer mortality rate is about 40 percent higher compared to the rest of Texas, and the childhood asthma rate is twice as high as the national average, according to a 2017 report from the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project.

In examining her father's side of the family, Baker also began to examine her own upbringing in Austin with her mother, who raised her as a single parent. Baker recalls some nights when she would have to boil water on the stove to use it as bathwater because her mother couldn't afford to pay the utility bills.

""I really started to reckon with my positionality as a Black woman who grew up in a single-parent-run household whose family suffers from all the legacies of structural racism that we see around the country,"" she said. ""It's a part of who I am, and it's something that I feel proud of, that I came through that, as well.""

Baker has carried her personal story into her work ever since.

""When I go into a space to have a conversation about the technical aspects of energy policy, I'm bringing those impacts with me. I'm bringing that legacy. I'm bringing those people with me,"" Baker said.

""I know exactly why I'm here.""

167,"Apr 6, 2021",Mississippi Today,How Black community leaders put Mississippi on the path to vaccine equity,"As Mississippi’s rollout of COVID-19 vaccines began to ramp up in early 2021, a troubling truth was revealed about the shots being put into people’s arms across the state: Black Mississippians weren’t getting their fair share.

Two months after the first doses were administered in the state, Black Mississippians had received just 19% of the total vaccines given, despite making up 38% of the state’s population. After bearing the brunt of cases and deaths early in the pandemic, Black Mississippians were being shorted on the road to recovery.

A few months later, the picture is quite different. Mississippi is much closer to vaccine parity, with 31% of total shots going to Black residents. For the past four weeks, Black Mississippians’ share of the doses administered has been equal to or higher than their share of the population.

The Blackest state in the nation is now doing a better job vaccinating its Black residents than 42 other states. And five of the states reporting a higher share of vaccinated Black residents have a total Black population between 1-3% and started vaccinating their residents weeks before Mississippi.

The efforts responsible for this progress towards vaccine equity have come overwhelmingly from the community level. They’ve come from Black doctors, faith leaders and organizers, who have gone to the Mississippi State Department of Health with solutions that were taken seriously and implemented. Solutions like increasing vaccine distribution to private physicians in areas densely populated by people of color that health officials say are responsible for the significant uptick in Black Mississippians getting vaccinated.

“I have to give (community partners) the credit in large measure because they understood the value it was for their communities,” State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said. “They stepped up and they got vaccinated, they did it publicly and they spoke about it. And they let us know what we need to do as far as making vaccines available within their communities.”

For months, health officials have emphasized trust and access as the two main hurdles to achieving parity when talking about the racial disparity in vaccine distribution. Black community leaders advocating for the vaccine, whether from behind the pulpit or a stethoscope, quickly found that the trust issue wasn’t all it was hyped up to be.

“I am convinced, as are many of the faith leaders, that we have moved beyond that attitude of hesitancy to a problem of access, no question about it,” said Jerry Young, Pastor of New Hope Baptist Church and president of the National Baptist Convention.

Pastor Young took part in an MSDH event in February that broadcast Black pastors from around the state taking their first doses. Young says that he and other faith leaders have seen a significant decrease in vaccine hesitancy in their congregations because of their advocacy.

Black churches have served a massive role in getting shots to where people are. Some large hospitals, like St. Dominic in Jackson, have partnered with people to bring vaccination events to their churches, giving 200-300 shots at a time.

“It’s about leadership, and in our community it’s extremely important for those of us who have that kind of trust to lead by example,” Young said. “That’s from pastors working together from the Gulf Coast all the way up to Southaven.”

A sharp decline in vaccine hesitancy among Black Americans is reflected in polling data. In a Kaiser Family Foundation poll from December, nearly two-thirds of Black respondents were hesitant about taking the vaccine. But when the same poll was conducted in March, that number had been cut in half. Recent polls also show that vaccine hesitancy is much more widespread among white Republicans and evangelicals.

After seeing a great response from Black patients to community vaccine education efforts, physicians like Dr. Andrea Phillips, who runs a small Jackson practice, set out to confront the outsized role vaccine hesitancy had in the conversation about racial disparities in the vaccine rollout.

“We were disturbed by the narrative that the sole reason for this was hesitancy in the African American community. We knew that that was a part of it, but we were addressing that and very aggressively,” Phillips said.

Phillips and others started asking MSDH to increase the allotments going to community health centers and small, family practices. Since the beginning of March, more of the state’s weekly dose allotment have gone to private providers than MSDH’s drive-thru vaccination sites. Health officials have acknowledged that the state’s drive-thru sites, while great for vaccinating a lot of people quickly, are not as effective as those local partners at vaccinating Black Mississippians.

“What I think the government was not realizing is that there’s a whole section of insured Black people that just go to their doctors,” Phillips said.

Even though physicians like Phillips signed up to be vaccine providers, they found themselves waiting weeks on end for a small number of shots.

“I was like, ‘I think we’re getting pushed to the background because I only want 100 or 200 shots at a time. And these other guys can take 600 or 700 at a time because they’re big places,’” Phillips said.

Phillips had received a handful of doses to fully vaccinate legacy physicians. Luckily, she had an extra dose during the second round and was able to bring in one of her patients, an 85-year-old woman who lives less than a mile from Phillip’s practice. She was in the first group eligible for vaccination, but she wanted her shot to come from Phillips.

“I introduced her to Dr. Dobbs and I said, ‘These are the people in west Jackson that are still not getting their vaccines because providers like me aren’t getting them,” Philips said.

A week later, Dobbs sent Phillips 100 doses.

That was more than she needed for her patients, so she made the rest available to anyone eligible who wanted one. Then MSDH sent another 100 doses. Phillips, who had been administering all the shots herself, knew she couldn’t do it all alone. So she organized two weekend vaccination events where volunteers from the Magnolia Hill Foundation turned her practice into its own drive-thru site. Philips also had help administering the shots from five registered nurses from the Eliza Pillars Nurses Association, the state’s first Black nurse association.

“It was just amazing to me how many people said they didn’t really have access, it was just easier for them to get it here than Smith Wills (Jackson’s drive-thru site),” Phillips said.

Now Phillips is tired and thinking about taking two weeks off. She’ll administer the last of her doses this weekend at the church of one of the nurses who helped with her drive-thru. She doesn’t know how many more vaccination events she will personally do, but she feels good about where we are.

“Mississippi, while we’ve come a long way, there’s still a problem,” Phillips said. “If the distribution we’re seeing right now continues, I think that we will ultimately see real vaccination parity.”

168,"Apr 8, 2021",Just Security,The U.S. Water and Wastewater Crisis – How Many Wake-up Calls Are Enough?,"In February, much of Texas plunged into darkness when the state’s electricity grid failed due to extreme cold weather conditions. What started as a foreseeable blackout quickly became a life-threatening calamity. The frigid temperatures cracked pipes and froze wells. To escape the frigid cold, have drinking water, and flush toilets, Texans were forced to boil snow and icicles. The extreme weather conditions and lack of basic amenities resulted in several fatal cases of hypothermia, frostbite, and carbon monoxide poisoning. More than 14 million people in Texas were affected, and lost access to clean water at the height of the crisis. At the beginning of March, there were still nearly 390,000 people who did not have water safe enough to drink in their homes.

This catastrophe illustrates what happens when aging and inadequate infrastructure is hit by extreme rain or snow—an increasingly regular occurrence due to climate change. And like with many tragedies, Texas’ devastation became a political media spectacle. The state governor’s attempt to blame renewable energies and deny responsibility made front pages, as did the images of Texas Senator Ted Cruz who fled to warmer temperatures to avoid discomfort. Much of the coverage of Texas’ disaster within the United States expressed shock of “third-world” conditions so close to home. However, even a cursory look at the United States shows that inadequate water and sanitation are more of a norm than an exception.

What happened in Texas was both predictable and preventable. February’s blackout and the lack of water resulted from failed political leadership and poor planning at the state level. The chronic lack of disaster preparedness and the move to deregulate the Texan electric grid ignored years of warnings from scientific and energy experts.

The disaster laid bare a widespread, yet still largely invisible, human rights crisis within U.S. borders: the lack of access to adequate sanitation and clean water, which impacts health and life expectancy, and makes housing uninhabitable.

And, the matter extends well beyond Texas. Over 2 million people across the country lack access to adequate sanitation and clean water, according to a 2020 report, Closing the Water Access Gap in the United States. Flint, Michigan, has gained notoriety for failing to provide clean water to residents, and the community fight for justice is ongoing. Last month, Jackson, Mississippi, made national headlines for its water crisis as water outages left more than 70 percent of the city’s residents without safe drinking water. The COVID-19 pandemic and extreme weather events have also exposed the longstanding American wastewater and sanitation crisis, which had received much less coverage than drinking water until recently. Black, Indigenous and Latinx populations disproportionately live without access to sanitation, and have had the highest infection and fatality rates from COVID-19. Responsive investments in rural plumbing and wastewater infrastructure represent some of the targeted solutions that have gained traction over the last year. This is as true in the United States as it is globally.

Advocacy focused on Lowndes County, Alabama, where it is estimated that 90 percent of residents lack adequate wastewater systems, has been central to the “discovery” of this widespread problem. But Lowndes is far from alone. In Centreville, Illinois, residents have struggled with raw sewage flooding their property for years – it not only smells, it is dangerous. In these communities, sewage backs up into residents’ yards and homes, often leading to health problems that include infections, like hookworm, and other tropical diseases that were thought to be eradicated in the United States.

It is easy to forget that, within U.S. borders, communities have long endured the conditions seen in Texas in February. In most instances, the challenges precede climate change. But climate change is turning the water and sanitation crises into a state of emergency. The problems faced by the Indigenous peoples from Alaska to the Midwest foreshadow what may soon be the reality for all Americans. In The Bethel-Central Yup’ik and Stebbins regions in Alaska, flooding from melting ice and snow — sinking land due to thawing permafrost — seep into flush tanks in households and mix with sewage regularly. In the Navajo Nation, the springs, where people used to be able to obtain water, no longer flow, as a result of climate change and environmental degradation.

Like Texas, the federal government has ignored calls to improve water and wastewater systems. For decades, the American Society of Civil Engineers has graded national infrastructure. In 2021, the United States scored a C- for drinking water and a D+ for its wastewater infrastructure. Between 2001 and 2017, a D+ was the highest grade the United States received for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure. A D grade denotes a high risk of failure and a dire need for revamping decaying infrastructure. One 2020 global environmental protection index ranked the United States behind 31 other countries, including Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Chile, Latvia, Slovenia, Spain, and the U.K. Clearly, the U.S. has been on notice that something needs to be done.

Where can the United States go from here?

On February 26, President Joe Biden’s “climate czar,” Gina McCarthy, called Texas’ devastation “a wake-up call,” and committed to “building back better.” This effort must start with the basics—ensuring that water reaches everyone.

Building back better requires far-reaching solutions to improve water access and prepare for climate-related disasters. Biden has already taken some initial steps in this direction. During his first week in office, he announced that the United States had officially rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and signed two executive orders prioritizing climate as central to U.S. national security. The administration has spoken about creating a “whole of government” approach to climate policy. Moreover, Biden’s newly announced $2 trillion infrastructure plan is a promising first step. The plan includes an injection of $56 billion to upgrade and modernize water and wastewater systems across the United States in the face of climate change threats. The plan faces opposition from Republicans, but Congress is also taking action. In March, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced the Water Quality Protection and Job Creation Act of 2021. This Act calls for $50 billion in direct spending on wastewater infrastructure and local water systems. Moving forward these investments, and other complementary measures, will require bipartisan cooperation and collaboration between all levels of government. Political support is essential to both averting catastrophes and improving the infrastructure that is indispensable for adequate and affordable water and sanitation for all.

The United States, however, need not forge a new path alone. The international human rights framework offers pathways to addressing the sanitation crisis, which sits at the intersection of climate change, longstanding inequality, and a history of infrastructure disinvestment.

In 2010, the United Nations adopted a formal resolution recognizing the rights to water and sanitation, and called on governments to utilize “financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer … to scale up efforts to provide safe, clean, accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all,” obligations derived from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of human rights treaties. The U.N.’s formal acknowledgement that water and sanitation are essential components of an adequate standard of living reflects lived experience and provides a normative foundation for policy. In 2010, the U.N. established an independent expert on safe drinking water and sanitation, who monitors compliance with these human rights norms. The Sustainable Development Goals further prioritize ensuring water and sanitation for all via Goal 6. Some countries, such as Kenya, the Maldives, Mexico, and Uruguay, already protect the right to sanitation in their national constitutions.

The components of the right to sanitation are straightforward: Safe and quality wastewater and sanitation should be affordable, accessible and available without discrimination. Governments are responsible for prioritizing universal access. In practice, this means tracking and addressing the disparities in access to adequate sanitation, including through disaggregated data, adopting affordability standards, prioritizing implementation in historically marginalized communities, and providing redress when this right is violated.

The Biden-Harris administration has offered some signs that an overhaul of the American water and wastewater infrastructure could be guided by human rights norms. Historically, the United States has given lip service to economic and social rights, but the reticence to adopt international human rights principles into domestic law has never actually abated.

Last week, in a stark departure from the prior administration, Secretary of State Antony Blinken affirmed that “[a]ll human rights are also co-equal. There is no hierarchy that makes some rights more important than others.” The federal government’s readiness to re-engage with global human rights principles was also apparent last month, when the United States heeded recommendations from other governments to improve sanitation and wastewater systems as part of the U.N. Universal Periodic Review of the United States.

With political will and leadership, human rights can guide domestic regulation and legislation, and galvanize investments in the communities that need it most. Grounding policy in human rights will also signal that affordability is a priority and provides a basis for collaboration at the federal, state, and local levels. Water and sanitation are not privileges, they are fundamental rights, and all Americans deserve them.

(WJTV) – Some businesses were affected by the city-wide water outage, including the Holiday Inn Express near I-55 South in Byram. It came as a result of the fire that took place Friday at the O.B. Water Treatment Plant in Ridgeland.

“Most of my city is not going to be affected but what is affected, I know I got a call from holiday inn they’re pretty upset because they don’t have no water on the second floor at all,” said Byram mayor Richard White.

The mayor broke down the area of Byram using the well-water and surface water. He said everything west of the interstate except the apartments in Byram is the surface water area that comes from the reservoir.

“Everybody on surface water would be the apartments, Holiday Inn and everything on the interstate 55 and everything down to Jackson industrial is going to be boil water starting right now,” he said.

Currently, Byram gets its surface water from Jackson. Mayor White is pushing for the city to get control of its own water.

“This is just another opportunity for us to have our own water and that’s what I will be pursuing, I think that is something that’s needs to be done,” he said.","(WJTV) – Some businesses were affected by the city-wide water outage, including the Holiday Inn Express near I-55 South in Byram.

Operation Shoestring, ChildFund International and Amazon Donate Water to Jackson Families

Jackson-based Operation Shoestring, an organization that provides academic, social and emotional support to children and their families, is partnering with ChildFund International and Amazon to provide more than 18,000 bottles of water to Jackson families and community members following the city's recent water crisis. Amazon has been partnering with nonprofits such as Operation Shoestring to distribute water to other populations suffering similar crises elsewhere in Mississippi and in Texas due to severe winter weather in February.

Operation Shoestring has also been providing affected communities with body wipes, waterless toothbrushes, water in bulk, hygiene kits and waterless cleaning supplies to households who were without water for several weeks. A citywide boil water alert that prevented families from using tap water in their homes only recently ended.

Water woes continue in the City of Jackson, two weeks after two wells in the Maddox-Jackson well water system failed. The city said it does not know when it will be able to apply a temporary fix to the issue at hand.Work crews pulled the pipes out of a well that reached over 1,000 feet into the ground.The problem remains: trying to find a temporary replacement for the broken-down pump. According to city leaders, the replacement has yet to be found. Dr. Charles Williams with the Jackson Public Works said they have been trying to find a pump for TV Road, but they are having difficulty because these pumps are not readily available. After over two weeks, residents in parts of south Jackson and Byram who heavily depend on the well site for water are still left high and dry. Work crews pulled the piping from the deep water well but could not repair the generator that brought the water to the distribution center.Byram Mayor Richard White said it is frustrating for the residents in his city who pay for the water.""I would not want anyone to try to bring a business in here with this water pressure,"" said Mayor White. ""The first thing they are going to say is 'by the way, we have problems with the water.'""A temporary pump was put at the Siwell Road well site, but city leaders are still having to tell their constituents to be patient.

Gov. Tate Reeves has submitted a request for federal assistance after February winter storms caused widespread power outages and damage across the state.

Following extensive damage assessments by county, state and federal officials, the state of Mississippi requested a Major Disaster Declaration for Public Assistance on Wednesday. The request aims to receive funding from the federal government to help support local governments and certain nonprofits in their recovery efforts from the winter event.

According to a press release from the Governor's Office, 31 counties and the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians met thresholds needed to ask for public assistance. The estimated total damage is approximately $25 million.

(WJTV) – The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (MDAC), along with the Mississippi Crisis Foundation, will distribute more than 2,500 food boxes. The event will start at 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, April 21, at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds in Jackson.

“The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce is proud to partner with the Mississippi Crisis Foundation on this endeavor,” said Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson. “A lot of our citizens are still struggling with health and loss of work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we’re glad to be able to assist Mississippi families in need on the State Fairgrounds.”



The food boxes will be filled with meat, milk, cheese, yogurt, potatoes, and apples. Those receiving a food box will also collect two and a half dozen eggs.

Those who plan to pick up a food box must remain in their vehicles with the windows up. MDAC volunteers will wear masks and gloves at all times and when instructed, the public will be allowed to open their car trunks for placement of their food box.

On the day of the event, the public must enter through Gate 1 on Jefferson Street and exit through Gate 6 on Greymont Street.","(WJTV) – The Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce (MDAC), along with the Mississippi Crisis Foundation, will distribute more than 2,500 food boxes.

175,"Apr 16, 2021",WGNO.com,James M. Cox Foundation donates $1.1million to coastal restoration efforts in Louisiana,"(BATON ROUGE, LA) – The James M. Cox Foundation has announced a $1.1million grant to support wetlands conservation efforts along Louisiana’s Gulf Coast, according to a press release from Cox Communications’ public affairs office.

The planned project will include the construction of terracing and restoring the flow of sediment-rich water to degraded marshland through channels cut in natural levees. This will help build new land. The project will also help with manage water levels in White Lake Wetlands to prevent flooding and create a safer environment for migratory birds.

Ducks Unlimited and the James M. Cox Foundation have a shared commitment to environmental stewardship and focus on giving back to the communities where their team members work and live. Cox has 1,200 employees who work in Louisiana.

“I was always taught that you leave the world better than you found it, and that’s why I have chosen to help Ducks Unlimited any way I can,” Jim Kennedy, Cox Enterprises Chairman and former Wetlands America Trust President said. “Ducks Unlimited’s conservation work on Louisiana’s Gulf Coast not only benefits the waterfowl and wildlife that thrive in the landscape, but also helps support the communities surrounding this critical habitat.”

The coastal prairies, marshes and bays of the Gulf of Mexico are among North America’s most productive wetland systems. Tragically, they are also among the most threatened, with more than 90% of coastal wetland loss in the lower 48 states occurring here. Kennedy’s gift to Ducks Unlimited’s Gulf Coast Initiative will enable DU to conduct crucial conservation work along the coast, in addition to promoting science, public policy and outreach efforts.

Conservation work under the Gulf Coast Initiative primarily focuses on the restoration and enhancement of high-quality coastal marsh and rice prairie wetland complexes. To date, more than 130,000 acres have been improved through the initiative.

More than 2-million people live, work and play in coastal Louisiana. Louisiana’s working coast sends more than $120billion in goods and services to the rest of the U.S. and exports $36.2billion internationally. The coast also supports infrastructure that supplies 90% of the nation’s outer continental shelf oil and gas.

Anthony Pope, senior vice president and region manager for Cox’s Southeast Region, said, “This is a significant project because Louisiana loses 17 square miles of coast each year – more than any other state in the country. Coastal conservation in Louisiana is of national importance, and my team and I are grateful to the James M. Cox Foundation for their support of Ducks Unlimited’s work here in Louisiana.”","(BATON ROUGE, LA) – The James M.

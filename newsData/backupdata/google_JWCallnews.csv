0,2-Mar-21,NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis brings to light long-standing problems in city","After more than two weeks without clean running water, Katasha Johnson saw a slow trickle dribbling down a faucet in her home on the west side of Jackson, Mississippi, on Tuesday.

But the brown drip didn't feel like a reprieve for Johnson, 38, who lost water after back-to-back winter storms slammed the city and its century-old water infrastructure last month.

""It's not enough to do anything with, and it doesn't even look safe,"" said Johnson, the mother of children ages 9, 6 and 3.

Instead, Johnson and her fiancé are using melted snow and collected rainwater stored in four large coolers to flush the toilet. To clean dishes and hands, Johnson boils pots of water taken from a bathtub that was pre-filled when water was available.

""It has been absolutely horrible to live like this,"" she said.

Jackson has entered the third week of a crisis that has left much of the city without water since freezing temperatures devastated much of the South. Community leaders say that the disaster isn't a one-off and that it has brought to light long-simmering issues of systemic breakdown and neglect.

Weeks after the storm, the city continues to be under a boil water notice, and residents are being urged to conserve water and lower consumption as much as possible. Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city. Many say they have been turned away after supplies ran out.

Jackson reported 96 main water breaks and leaks, 53 of which have been repaired, the mayor's office said a statement.

""Today we saw pressure stay around 83 to 85 psi. This is good, but ultimately, we need to get to 90 psi and stay there consistently in order for water to be restored to everyone. This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the statement said.

More than half of the city's schools are closed because of the water crisis; only 19 of nearly 50 public schools have reopened.

While it's still unclear how many residents are out of water, community leaders, like state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, say it's at least 40,000.

Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Crudup has had no water for 16 days. He lives with his wife and two grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, in the hardest-hit part of the city, in South Jackson.

""We can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry. It's tremendously difficult,"" he said.

Crudup said that the city's infrastructure was already frail and that the crisis has highlighted how easily it can break.

""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,"" he said. ""This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable and co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative, a local nonprofit organization, said the water crisis has highlighted a slew of underlying issues long afflicting the community.

""This was a breakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens,"" she said. ""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people.""

Church as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Jackson's population is more than 80 percent Black.

Welchlin said the government hasn't invested in Jackson's infrastructure for a very long time.

""All of this is interconnected. Because of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see,"" she said.

Welchlin and Crudup said state and federal intervention is necessary to fully address not just infrastructure but all of the underlying issues connected to the crisis.

In the interim, several groups have stepped up to aid community members. The Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and other local organizations have coordinated supplies, water and services for residents in need. They have donated gift cards for food and bills and arranged for water trucks, and they have been dropping off cases of bottled water.

But many residents have also had to dip into their own pockets. Kehinde Gaynor, 42, has had to rent three hotel rooms in the last two weeks to give his wife and three children a place with safe water to bathe and wash.

Many residents have had to do that, he said, and the expenses have added up very quickly.

""Not having water isn't new to us. We've lost it before, but never as long as this,"" he said. ""It's affecting every part of our life, and to me it feels like we're the next Flint, Michigan.""","Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city.

JACKSON, Miss. – Two weeks into a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, after a series of winter storms, city officials say they do not know how many residents are still without water or when water will be restored.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Tuesday that there are still pockets of homes in south Jackson's high-elevation areas without water, but he could not share a total number of outages.

He said water pressure at the city's treatment plant was gradually being restored, but a firm date for restoration of the system remains elusive.

For more than two weeks, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.

Williams had said he was hopeful the system would be up to speed by Feb. 26, the weekend after the city first reported a water shortage on Feb. 17.

Instead, he said the prolonged freezing temperatures from winter storm systems crippled a system unequipped to deal with the temperature drop.

More than 100 water breaks reported

The system is still not putting out enough water pressure to service its more than 43,000 customers. That has been complicated by water main breaks across the city that have leaked water into city streets and yards. Since the city first reported a water shortage, more than 100 water breaks have been reported. As of Monday night, crews had completed 53 repairs, he said.

Williams said Tuesday that it's possible a large water main break that has not been reported is also siphoning water from the city's water supply.

""A hard number is difficult to track,"" Williams said. ""We would have to go door-to-door to know precisely where all the outages are.""

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has also been been hesitant to give a firm date for recovery of the water system.

The city has been tracking outages through reports from residents and its 311 hotline. The mayor's spokeswoman, Michelle Atoa said that as of Tuesday afternoon the hotline had received more than 1,500 water outage calls since Feb. 15, but she was unable to provide a hard number of residence outages or an estimate.

The mayor's office said in an email that it had crews out Tuesday in south Jackson neighborhoods and in higher elevated areas of the city where residents are still experiencing outages. The crews are testing pressure levels and releasing trapped air from hydrants that may be impeding flow.

3,15-Mar-21,Slate,Ignore Mississippi’s Water Crisis at Your Own Peril,"For four weeks now, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have had no potable water. Even though repairs are underway for dozens of broken water mains and other equipment, the city’s 161,000 residents remain under a boil-water advisory, and hundreds still have no running water at all. The story is similar to ones we’ve heard before: thousands of mostly Black residents struggling to carry on without access to the most essential of necessities; a decades-old, multibillion-dollar water system in desperate need of major repair; proposed funding solutions that don’t go nearly far enough. But what separates Jackson from other ongoing municipal water crises nationwide, and worldwide, is its particular catalyst and the aftereffects.

Advertisement

The water crises that captured the most headlines in recent years were the result of governmental and corporate malpractice. Cities like Flint, Michigan—which is still grappling with lead-contaminated water—and Summerville, Georgia, saw their drinking water become unsafe after those in power tried to skirt regulations or save a few bucks. But Jackson was hit by a different kind of beast, one that threatens us all: a government unprepared to handle the effects of climate change and neglectful of the citizens who are most harmed by it.

The same storms that capsized Texas’ power grid in February also dumped unprecedented amounts of snow throughout the South. Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Mississippi all had energy or water stoppages, or both, as a result. Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting. In Jackson alone, about 80 water mains broke. But by late February, as safe water began flowing back to the hard-hit South, Jackson’s leaders kept pushing back their own projected deadlines for potable water restoration, and Gov. Tate Reeves briefly pondered a state takeover of the city’s water system. Though thousands of Texans are still struggling with their own busted pipes, its water treatment plants could at least resume operations following power restoration. In Jackson, the damage was even deeper.

Mississippi is the most impoverished state in the country; it’s also among the sickest and most publicly underfunded, with hospitals, schools, and other public services unable to properly serve residents, even when they aren’t being pummeled by storms. City workers tasked with repairing the water system have noted that some parts of it are a century old, and that the parts that aren’t nearly as ancient are quite brittle. The storms also directly maimed necessary equipment for the water treatment plants, hurting the purifying process even after power came back. The city’s O.B. Curtis Plant saw its intake screens freeze and raw water pumps malfunction while its feeder reservoir dropped in temperature. Drivers couldn’t deliver needed treatment chemicals to the plant for a while because of the icy, broken roads. Add that to a recent history of poor disaster management: In 2015, then–Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber declared two separate states of emergency for the city’s infrastructure, citing water mains and roads that were cracking under pressure from more mild winter weather. It was a unique order that could have spurred much-needed repairs, but the City Council overturned the second emergency order, and only a few fixes funded by state aid were eventually made in the following years. For this more recent disaster, it was only last week that the city signed off on a request to the state to provide $47 million for repairs.

Usually, water crises fueled by climate change are most visibly perceived in the form of droughts, groundwater depletion, sea level rise, or historic flooding. In Jackson, the water crisis stemmed from a bureaucratic infrastructure issue: the vulnerability of essential water treatment plants to unprecedented storms that are growing in frequency. In the same way Texas’ energy troubles demonstrated the need to mandate power grid winterization, Jackson’s emergency shows how our officials must work to protect the thing most of us take completely for granted. But that will also cost a lot of money and require major reform. If the Democratic-dominated federal government is already having issues figuring out national infrastructure priorities, the hard-right Mississippi Legislature certainly won’t fulfill its own state’s needs. More than likely, your city or state is facing similar woes.

These problems will play out first, though, in places struggling most with poverty and racism. Jackson’s population is 82 percent Black, and despite being the state’s capital and most populous metropolis, it suffers from a meager tax base, as its wealthier white residents fled the city in increasing numbers following the civil rights era; about a quarter of the city lives in poverty. Jackson’s Black leaders have long been aware of the issues plaguing their city and tried to do what they can to solve them, only to be rebuffed time and again by the mostly white and Republican state government. Climate change will only exacerbate such inequalities.

Not every American city has the same forces working against it as Jackson does, but the problems occurring there will also happen elsewhere. Many Americans have been lucky to have stable shelter, power, water, and protection against the coronavirus throughout the past year. But that’s all that is—luck. Unless governments take the appropriate response to heavily bolster our infrastructure and protect our most vulnerable, there’s no reason to think anybody will be so fortunate to escape unscathed the next time the storms come around. Jackson’s suffering residents know this all too well.","Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting.

You Can’t Wash.’ Water Crisis Hobbles Jackson, Miss., for Weeks","Mr. Reeves called in the National Guard last month to help distribute water and has hinted that the state might take over Jackson’s water system. His chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor’s office was helping the city explore securing low-interest state loans to help pay for upgrades. He also noted that Mr. Lumumba had been meeting with members of the Republican-dominated State Legislature, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding.

In an interview this week, Mr. Lumumba said he hoped the current crisis would finally push both state and city officials in the direction of a long-term solution.

“There’s a saying that you should allow no crisis to go to waste,” he said. “It’s crises like these that really allow us to take stock of conditions of where we are as a city, where we are as a state and hopefully it allows us to build the resolve to address it.”

The city has had a dwindling tax base for decades, after the integration of schools and other public spaces in Jackson triggered a dramatic flight of white residents. In many cases, they took their wealth and tax dollars with them. In 1960, the city was about 64 percent white and 36 percent Black. Today it is about 16 percent white and 82 percent Black.

This week, the water barely trickled from the faucets in Carolyn Willis’s apartment. Ms. Willis, a retired nursing home cook who is Black, said that in a majority-white city, the kind of water crisis she and her neighbors continued to face “wouldn’t be happening.”

It's been a month since some in Jackson, Miss., had usable running water. A winter storm hit the aging infrastructure in the majority Black city, and many are angry about how long the fix is taking.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Hundreds of residents in Jackson, Miss., are now in week four of a water crisis. Some in the majority-Black capital city still don't have water after last month's winter storm. Others have to boil their water first. Mississippi Public Broadcasting's Becca Schimmel spent time with a family struggling to get by.

BECCA SCHIMMEL, BYLINE: Marion Roberts has been without running water since the middle of February.

MARION ROBERTS: I'm turning the faucet on and off. And as you can see, there's no drips. There's no nothing. It's just dry. Nothing, no water.

SCHIMMEL: Roberts keeps her faucets open, so she'll hear the water as soon as it comes back on. She lives with her three adult children. The winter storm that ravaged Texas, causing millions of people there to lose power and water, also hit Mississippi, freezing pipes and breaking decades-old water mains. Roberts has been trying to pick up water from city distribution sites or buy it at grocery stores so that her family can try to have some sense of normalcy.

ROBERTS: So I've been trying to, like, keep up with it. We take baths with it. We take, like, four bottles of water, take a bath. Yeah. And we brush our teeth - is one bottle. We're still not able to wash dishes.

SCHIMMEL: All of those mundane and routine tasks people take for granted require more time and effort for the nearly 500 homes and businesses in Jackson that still have no water. Even flushing her toilet requires her to fill it up each time. So Roberts now has a new daily routine.

ROBERTS: Start going through the process of getting everything together. These bottles are empty. As you can see, there's an empty bottle right there. We start loading stuff up in the trunk. I had a water cooler. And we'd just fill up the water and then bring it back to the house. And I would do that probably - I was doing it twice a day. Now I'm down to doing it once a day. So, like, tomorrow, if I need some more water, I'll go back, fill up.

SCHIMMEL: Robert's 20-year-old daughter Melody hasn't had a proper shower at home for weeks. Every day when she goes to college, she worries about what other people think.

MELODY: It don't make me feel so confident as much as I am because I'm like, I cleaned myself, but what if I have a smell to me because I don't have water at home?

SCHIMMEL: And her mother, Marion, cares deeply for her city. Seeing the people of Jackson go without water for so long is maddening, especially when it feels like people outside the state have forgotten about Mississippians who are suffering.

ROBERTS: I mean, I feel like the help has lessened. You don't see the National Guard out here anymore. Everybody's gone. It's like, forget them. And I feel like it's because of the color of my skin. And I hate that.

SCHIMMEL: South Jackson, where the Roberts live, has been hit especially hard by the water crisis. Jackson's population is about 80% Black and has long had trouble getting the attention and financial help it needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba doesn't deny how racism has factored into the city's underfunded infrastructure.

CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: I think that if we're honest with ourselves, we have to recognize the role that that plays. Often, we're a bit skittish of having those conversations. But we have to realize that issues of race are as American as apple pie.

SCHIMMEL: Lumumba says the city has known it's needed to rebuild its infrastructure for years. In 2010, another big freeze did even more damage than this winter storm. The mayor says Jackson needs help, and it's going to take state or federal funding to secure safe drinking water. For Marion Roberts, she's debating what's next for her.

ROBERTS: I mean, I love the city of Jackson. I love Mississippi. I was raised here. But if I had a choice, to be honest, if I can get up and move - like, somebody told me, you can go anywhere - I would move.

SCHIMMEL: It's still unclear when the water will be back on for the hundreds of people like her. For NPR News, I'm Becca Schimel in Jackson, Miss.

The city of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice after two winter storms disrupted daily life last week.

More than 10,000 across Mississippi are still without power and water, according to the latest estimate from PowerOutage.US. There is still no definitive timetable for when these utilities will return.

Here is what you need to know and what you need to do — as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — if you and your household remain under a boil-water notice:

FOR SUBSCRIBERS: Mississippi still reeling from winter storms as leaders struggle to deal with fallout

JACKSON WATER CRISIS: Residents, businesses still with little to no water

What do I do if I'm under a boil-water notice?

The CDC and the Mississippi State Department of Health suggest bringing water to a full boil for 1 minute and allowing it to cool before using it. The health department recommends the following steps:

Don't drink tap water

Don't use iced made from recent tap water

Don't use tap water to make drinks, juices or fountain soft drinks.

Only cook with tap water if food is boiled for at least one minute.

Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water

You should boil tap water even if it is filtered, including water from a refrigerator or ice maker.

Can you shower/bathe with a boil water order?

It is safe to shower, but be careful not to swallow any water. Young children should be supervised to ensure they don't drink water.

Can you wash dishes during a boil-water notice?

Dishwashers are typically safe to use if the final rinse temperature reaches at least 150 degrees or if the machine has sanitizing cycle. Otherwise, it is best to used disposable dishes and utensils.

While the CDC says dishwashers are generally safe to use, the Mississippi State Department of Health does not recommend it.

If you need to wash dishes by hand, wash and rinse as you normally would using hot water, but in a separate basin add 1 teaspoon of unscented household liquid bleach for each gallon of warm water. Soak the rinsed dishes in the water for at least one minute, and let dishes air dry before using.

Can you do laundry?

Yes, laundry can be done as usual during a boil-water advisory.

What about pets?

Pets could also get sick from drinking water during a boil-water advisory. Provide your animals with bottled water or boiled water.

What do I do when the boil-water notice is lifted?

According to the state health department, here are the steps to take:

Flush faucets for a total of 10 minutes to introduce system water throughout the house plumbing Flush faucet a minimum of 2 minutes to ensure clearing of the line serving the faucet

Discard any drinks, ice, food, etc, made during the boil water notice.

Rewash any food or drink contact items (knives, forks, plates, etc.) with cleared system water.

Check water filters and replace if necessary.

Do not use water from your hot water heater for drinking until several exchanges of the tank have occurred.

Run dishwasher through a cycle or two before washing dishes.

How do I get more information?

If you have any further questions, you can contact the Mississippi State Department of Health Bureau of Public Water Supply by calling (601) 576-7518.

7,10-Mar-21,In These Times,Biden Could Help Prevent Water Crises Like the One in Jackson—If He Stands Up to Corporations,"A month after winter storms wreaked havoc across the U.S. South, Jackson, Mississippi is still in the midst of a major crisis. As of March 5, thousands of residents continued to lack water service, and many more were subject to boil water advisories — all in the midst of a raging global pandemic that has caused immense suffering, especially in BIPOC communities.

The immediate cause of the crisis was record low temperatures, which caused many of the city’s aging pipes to break and knocked the main water treatment plant offline. But the situation in Jackson has much deeper roots, and it highlights the intersections between deteriorating infrastructure, racism and white supremacy, racial disparities in public health, and the failures of privatization. As the Biden administration begins to ramp up its infrastructure plans, it should not only prioritize cities like Jackson, but also ensure that badly needed infrastructure investments strengthen and preserve local ownership and control rather than siphon them off to giant corporations and international banks through exploitative and extractive privatization and public-private partnership (PPP) deals.

Like many cities, much of Jackson’s water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement. While the recent storms exacerbated the system’s problems, residents in the 82% Black, largely low-income city have long dealt with boil water advisories and contaminated water. In fact, as Gizmodo’s Dharna Noor points out, ​“research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color.”

The plight of Jackson’s water system is a direct result of entrenched white supremacy in the state. ​“Be very clear,” Donna Ladd, founding editor of the Jackson Free Press, recently wrote, ​“white wealth didn’t just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn’t take with them — a 20th century Sherman’s march out of American cities.” This process has included underfunding the city’s schools, using state legislation to control what the city can do to generate tax revenue, and, egregiously, attempting to seize control of the city’s publicly owned airport, which, Ladd writes, is ​“one of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left.”

Much of the attention being paid to Jackson’s water crisis has highlighted the need for significant federal and state support for water infrastructure modernization. Yet another critical part of the story hasn’t received the same consideration: The crisis in Jackson demonstrates not only the need for large-scale infrastructure investments, but the dangers of funneling those funds into extractive privatization and PPP deals that are often overly expensive, under-performing, and lack local accountability and control.

In 2012, former Jackson Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. — the city’s first Black mayor — realized that previous white-led administrations had left the city’s water infrastructure in poor shape. As part of his efforts to fix the problem that year, Mayor Johnson signed a $90 million deal with Siemens — a large German multinational corporation — to upgrade water and sewer facilities, install new water meters and implement an automated billing system. Five years later, however, the Jackson City Council authorized new mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to sue Siemens and its subcontractors for numerous failures related to the contract.

The lawsuit alleged that ​“instead of generating revenue or savings for the City, the work Siemens contracted to complete resulted in problems that have thrown Jackson’s water-sewer system into crisis and the City further into debt.” In particular, the new meter and billing system was riddled with problems, leading some residents to never receive a utility bill and others to receive exorbitant bills that they couldn’t pay. This, in turn, led the city to start moving money from its general fund to pay for water and sewer repairs.

More egregiously, Mayor Lumumba alleged that Siemens and the subcontractors ​“manipulated the minority contracting rules” to essentially double the cost of the project. While Siemens disputed these accusations, the company nonetheless settled the city’s lawsuit in early 2020 — agreeing to repay the entire $90 million contract. While this was a victory for the city’s residents, the amount (of which lawyers will take a substantial cut) is far less than the original $450 million the city was seeking when lost revenue and additional costs to repair the damaged system are taken into account.

Jackson is not alone in suffering the ill-effects of corporate involvement in the provision of water. There has been growing resistance to water privatization in the United States in recent years, along with several high-profile remunicipalizations—where privately-run services have been brought back under public control. Three interconnected factors, which were seen to varying degrees in Jackson, are driving many of these local efforts: higher rates and costs under private operation; poor performance and service by private operators; and loss of local control over decision making.

While large-scale investments — like the $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden laid out on the campaign trail — are urgently needed to address the critical issues facing Jackson and other U.S. communities, the design of such programs will be critical. Those investments could either serve to lower racial and economic inequality, provide high-quality services, and preserve local control by supporting public and cooperative ownership structures; or they could supercharge privatization and line the pockets of large multinational corporations at the expense of the health and prosperity of local residents.

If the Biden administration is serious about ​“Building Back Better,” it must ensure that justice and equity are at the heart of its agenda.","Like many cities, much of Jackson’s water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement.
While the recent storms exacerbated the system’s problems, residents in the 82% Black, largely low-income city have long dealt with boil water advisories and contaminated water.
In fact, as Gizmodo’s Dharna Noor points out, ​“research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color.”The plight of Jackson’s water system is a direct result of entrenched white supremacy in the state.
In 2012, former Jackson Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. — the city’s first Black mayor — realized that previous white-led administrations had left the city’s water infrastructure in poor shape.

8,6-Mar-21,NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi has a water crisis because our state legislature has a race problem","Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves told the media this week, “I do think it's really important that the City of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money.""

As the governor gave that lecture on March 3 in his state’s capital city, thousands of homes near where he sat in Jackson were without even non-potable water to flush their toilets, and not a single home in the city limits had access to safe drinking water we could use without boiling first.

The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann threw out a telling statement of his own when he criticized the poverty-stricken city for not fixing its own water system, adding, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?”

Mayor Ditto's final term in office ended in 1997; people born during it are old enough to buy alcohol these days.

The real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

For people not steeped in Mississippi politics, Ditto — not coincidentally — was Jackson’s last white mayor before white-flight demographic shifts brought Harvey Johnson Jr., an urban planner and infrastructure wonk who devoted $200 million to the problem, to office. Johnson warned repeatedly of a future breakdown of our aging systems in Jackson, including around the state Capitol where Reeves and Hosemann had the temerity to lecture us. This was a system, it’s worth noting, that was not exactly handed over to Black leadership in pristine shape, with nary a crack or challenge. It was already in trouble then.

But white state leadership at the time and ever since — including those whose families left Jackson after the forced desegregation of schools in early 1970 — have typically responded to the city’s Black leaders with contempt, blank stares or condescension.

The immediate cause of the broad, systemic breakdown of Jackson’s water system was the same unprecedented cold-weather spell for which Texas received national attention in February. But the real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

Still, as my reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, Nick Judin, and I understood — because he and I grew up in the area — Reeves and Hosemann's words augured back to a long-held talking point and belief among many white Mississippians: Black leaders just aren’t competent. And the people who elect them deserve what they get.

In the last couple days, we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and help its capital city through this water crisis.

It’s not like this belittlement tactic is accidental. It dates back to a time when Jackson was a wealthy white center of power for the state — until the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 started upending the white-supremacist status quo. Jackson political and business leaders panicked at the thought of integrated schools — and children of different races getting to know and respect each other (gasp) — as well as the prospect of Black people voting, holding top offices and ordering their sandwiches at the city's lunch counters instead of the cafes' backdoors.

So, via the racist Citizens’ Councils that soon spread across the U.S. as far west as San Francisco, the elites in Jackson started marketing three old and intertwined ideas, as Jackson historian Stephanie Rolph details in her book “Resisting Equality: The Citizens’ Council, 1954-1989.” First, they pushed that Black people were born inferior; second, that their supposed inferiority meant they couldn’t run things well; and third, that they are constitutionally prone to crime.

All this rhetoric has helped drive businesses and residents out of Jackson from the 1950s to this day, despite zero evidence for any of the vicious lies.

Still, the racist Citizens Councils' putrid ideas stuck around, influencing many in and outside Mississippi. The myths were and are assisted by every possible effort to ensure that Black people — who have been redlined and discriminated out of the same wealth-generation avenues that white people had enjoyed since slavery was legal — could not prove them wrong. Much of that has come in the form of withholding the financial resources necessary for the basic running and maintenance of, say, a capital city, its public schools and its water and sewer systems.

Be very clear: white wealth didn’t just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn't take with them — a 20th century Sherman's march out of American cities, if you will.

Whether those in power have bothered to face our history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

Many of the same prominent whites who proudly attended well-funded public schools in Jackson before integration have, since abandoning the city, done everything possible to limit even “adequate” urban school funding or to redirect the money to legacy segregation academies — now usually called “private Christian academies.” They use the state legislature to control how much Jackson can tax our own citizens in order to pay for our own needs. They won’t support desperately needed flood mitigation for the city — unless it provides rich white people with valuable waterfront development. And Medicaid expansion in the time of Covid-19? Forget about it.

White state politicians are even trying to steal one of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left. In 2016, white Mississippi Republicans began a naked attempt to take over the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport — a name, by the way, that still displeases some of the Old Guard — by passing legislation to replace its city-appointed commissioners with a state-appointed governing board, only two of whom would come from Jackson. Black legislators called the move “Jim Crow legislation.” Primary sponsors of the bill didn’t try to hide that they have real-estate interests in the whiter suburban areas just outside the airport gates.

Oh, and their continual excuse for taking it? The airport leaders aren’t up to the task of managing it. (I’ll allow you to imagine the race of those highly qualified professionals.)

On Thursday night, I co-moderated a Jackson mayoral debate in which Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba recounted that Lt. Gov. Hosemann had offered him financial help for the city — an insulting $30 million — if he would drop a lawsuit that has forestalled the theft of the airport to date. Lumumba said no, of course.

The dignity for which Jacksonians are asking includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

In the last couple days — since Hosemann’s Ditto comment — we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state of Mississippi is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and actually help its capital city through this water crisis: They are now in discussions about financial assistance of at least $47 million.

Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers. Whether those who engage in that thinking have bothered to face that history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

I get it, though: A racist political machine raised many white Mississippians to believe they were simply superior at running things, over any given Black leader in the state. They look at the world through white-tinged glasses and believe their power and wealth, or any power or wealth they might eventually be able to amass, is dependent on scrapping over scarcity. They think they don’t or won't get theirs if they treat the majority-Black capital city, its leaders and its residents with the respect and dignity our citizens deserve.

That dignity for which Jacksonians are asking, though, includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

It’s long, long past time to put Citizens Council-era propaganda to rest and treat Black leaders and Black Mississipians like equals, not like pawns in yet another white power game.","The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov.

9,19-Feb-21,ABC News,"No 'definitive timeline' when water will return to Jackson, Mississippi: Mayor","""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Jackson's public works director said.

As power and water outages rock the South, among the hard-hit cities is Jackson, Mississippi, where most residents face little to no water pressure.

""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover.""

""This becomes increasingly challenging"" due to the pandemic, Lumumba said, because so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the length of the cold snap in Jackson has taken a toll on the water production.

""Hopefully by this weekend you will start seeing some pressure build back up and water will slowly be restored,"" Williams said Thursday, adding that it's difficult to give a timeline because the weather impacts are ""unpredictable.""

""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Williams said. ""We're working around the clock.""

On Friday, Williams told reporters there was some progress in the city's water pressure, but it was still hard to predict when people will get their water back. Those who live closer to the city's two water plants should expect to have water sooner than those who live farther away, he said.

Water main breaks are another concern; as of Friday afternoon, there were 13 in the city, with more expected as the ice and snow melts, Williams said.

""We hope that it does not increase very much because that will delay some of the recovery process,"" he said.

A boil water notice was issued Thursday.

Jackson officials are offering water distribution at several sites Friday.

Besides the water emergency, between 18,000 to 19,000 customers in Jackson were without power Thursday, largely due to limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain, the mayor said.

Lumumba warned that roads are still topped with ice and urged caution while driving to get basic necessities.

""This is the time ... to help one another, especially our most vulnerable constituents,"" City Council President Aaron Banks said.

After a week of historic and disastrous snow, ice and cold in the South, the freezing temperatures will soon lift. A hard freeze warning is in effect in Mississippi Friday morning but temperatures are expected to rise this weekend.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was expected to meet Monday with Environmental Protection Agency officials to request federal funding as the capital city's unprecedented water crisis nears its fourth week.

City officials continue to say water pressure is being restored, but shared no data to show any progress. In some pockets of the city, largely among those on higher elevations, residents are still experiencing little to no water pressure.

The drinking water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a citywide boil notice first issued on Feb. 16.

Testing has revealed the city's water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance the water may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams on Monday said the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city possibly Thursday once the city's water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

Williams said about 95% of the city's approximately 43,000 water customers now have water. He did not provide a specific number of residents still dealing with an outage, adding a majority of those still without water live off Forest Hill and McCluer roads in south Jackson.

Meanwhile, Lumumba and city officials continue to scramble to solicit state and federal funding as the notice extends into a third week.

Lumumba said Friday the EPA has been responsive for possible federal relief for the city's troubled water system.

The City Council last week approved a request from the mayor's office to apply for a grant from the EPA that could bring in $500,000, according to the EPA.

Also last week, Lumumba sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves requesting about $47 million in state and federal funds.

11,8-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,Lt. Gov. Hosemann on Jackson water crisis: “We want to help.”,"Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who wields significant control over the state of Mississippi’s budget, said he is open to appropriating funds to the city of Jackson, where thousands of residents are in their fourth week without running water.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, while city officials said water pressure has been restored to “95% of the city,” about 5,000 Jackson residents are still without water. City leaders say they need major investment from the state to replace their entire water and sewage system, which is estimated to cost about $2 billion.

Hosemann, in a one-on-one interview on Monday with Mississippi Today, said that he considers all options on the table in terms of financially supporting Jackson, including through several bills pending in the Legislature and potentially sending some of the state’s share of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Congress is expected to pass later this week.

“I’ve lived in Jackson more than 50 years. More than half my life has been spent here,” Hosemann told Mississippi Today. “I’ve spent a lot of time trying to make it better, and I want to make it better now. There’s a water crisis, and we want to help. Where we can help them with the funding, I want to do that. Jackson is the capital of Mississippi. It deserves to be supported as such.”

Hosemann continued: “The people that are responsible are the leaders of the city, and they need to come up with a cogent plan that explains how much they need and what they’re going to do with funding they may get. That gives us more room to support them monetarily.”

Hosemann and Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba are scheduled to meet Tuesday morning to discuss the crisis and how the state can help. Lumumba, who wrote a letter to state leaders last week asking for an initial emergency appropriation of $47 million, met with Speaker of the House Philip Gunn on Friday.

READ MORE: Talks begin at Capitol to secure state funding for Jackson water crisis

In addition to considering potential state funding, Hosemann and his staff studied the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Congress is expected to pass this week. The lieutenant governor on Monday said he believed there are several pots of money within that package that could be appropriated to Jackson for work on its water system.

Questions about whether lawmakers will support the city have swirled after tension between Hosemann and Lumumba — long whispered about in the halls of the Capitol — came to light on March 4 during a mayoral debate ahead of 2021 municipal elections. At the heart of the tiff between the lieutenant governor and mayor is control of the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport, which state leaders have tried for years to wrest from the city.

In 2016, lawmakers approved a bill to take over the airport and replace the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority with a regional board made up of state, county, and city appointees.

That law, however, has not gone into effect after the city joined a federal lawsuit to block the takeover. That lawsuit has continued, and city officials have said the state’s motives were race-based. Currently, the city controls the airport with its own board. All board members are African American. The lawmakers who pushed and passed the 2016 legislation are white.

“I sat down with the lieutenant governor to talk about Jackson’s infrastructure problem,” Lumumba said during the debate, referencing a meeting that occurred before the current water crisis. “We had a conversation that lasted for about an hour and a half, and he asked everyone to leave the room only to say, ‘Mayor, I need you to give me my airport, and I look at it for about $30 million.’”

Lumumba continued: “Not only am I supposed to be dumb, I’m also supposed to be cheap.”

When asked on Monday about the mayor’s comments, Hosemann said the inference that infrastructure funding from the state would be held up over any airport-related business “is completely inaccurate.”

“My concern about the work we have to do on Jackson’s water is a totally separate matter,” Hosemann said. “In regards to pending litigation between the city and state over the airport, I did speak about that with the mayor and said I would like to settle that case. But there is not a quid pro quo here. (The current water crisis) occurred after our meeting. We were in discussions about a number of things about the city, and I told him it was confidential. I intend to honor my side of the bargain.”

When asked if the airport would be a consideration during debate about whether to provide Jackson with state funding for its current crisis, Hosemann said, “Absolutely not. I just disagree with that.”

Meanwhile, a House bill introduced by Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, on Monday seeks legislative approval to allow the city of Jackson to hold a summer referendum to pass a one-cent sales tax increase. If approved, that new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — could be used to back large bonds that the city would use to revamp its water and sewer system.

The House bill was dropped after a Friday meeting between Lumumba and Speaker Gunn in which the mayor asked for support of the city’s one-cent sales tax increase. Lumumba also asked Gunn to consider the $47 million emergency appropriation for specific projects.

While Gunn made no promises, several of the meeting’s attendees expressed optimism that future talks between the speaker and mayor would continue as the 2021 legislative session approaches its scheduled end of April 4.

Hosemann said he’ll hear the mayor out in their Tuesday meeting and will work with senators to determine the best course of action. He added: “Everything is on the table.”

“I think asking questions (of the city) about a specific plan is healthy and important,” Hosemann said. “But we’re not going to ignore the crisis or the people affected. That’s not who I am personally, whether I’ve been an elected official or not. The city has its leadership, the state has its leadership, and we want to make sure we’re helpful to any citizen in a crisis.”

12,8-Mar-21,Truthout,Jackson Residents Are Going on Week Four Without Water in Mississippi,"After a winter storm caused record low temperatures and snowfall across the U.S. in February, thousands of residents in Jackson, Mississippi, lost water in their homes. As the city slowly fixes water breaks, some residents are now in their fourth week without water.

Tens of thousands of Jackson’s 160,000 residents went weeks without water after the storm, and the rest of the city was, and still is, under a boil-water advisory. Last week, the city’s public works director Charles Williams said that a quarter of the city, or about 10,000 connections, still lacked water. As of Friday, the city had restored connections to 42,000 customers total and fewer than 5,000 customers still lacked water.

The storm had frozen machinery at the city’s water treatment plant and had caused 101 water main breaks and leaks, at least 70 of which the city had repaired last week, the city said. The National Guard has been assisting in water distribution to the residents of the city, but they’re still waiting for hours in lines to get water bottles or non-potable water for flushing toilets.

There are many residents, however, who can’t access the water that the city is distributing. With over a quarter of the city’s residents in poverty, many people don’t have the time or resources to wait in lines for hours for water.

Many organizers, residents and observers say that part of the reason for the crisis is that the city has a majority Black population, and the city has thus had less funding and support. Over 82 percent of the city is Black, and the city has been losing residents, mostly white ones, for decades. The declining tax revenue as a result of the population loss is just one contributor to the city’s infrastructure problem.

The Mississippi city’s infrastructure has been in poor shape for decades, and the city’s mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, has called Jackson an “aging city with an aging budget.” The city has a budget of about $300 million a year and “a more than $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,” Lumumba said during a press conference last month.

Donna Ladd, editor of The Jackson Free Press and the Mississippi Free Press, said in an article for MSNBC that the state and city’s white supremacist leadership in the past decades has set up Jackson for failure.

“The fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level,” wrote Ladd. “It is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.” White state-level politicians, Ladd says, have continually made moves to stunt Jackson’s growth, financially and otherwise.

The crisis is also connected to climate catastrophe. The February storm was almost certainly a result of the climate crisis causing unusual weather patterns and increasing the frequency of extreme weather, which Lumumba has acknowledged. The city’s infrastructure, much like the energy infrastructure in Texas, was not ready for the cold temperatures that suddenly hit the state.

“Not only do we need this investment because of the aging infrastructure,” Lumumba said earlier this month, “we need this investment because of the increased pressure that these extreme weather conditions are taking.” Lumumba has requested $47 million in emergency funding from Republican Gov. Tate Reeves for needed water infrastructure updates.

This isn’t the first time that Jackson has experienced issues with their water; the city’s residents have continually experienced service issues over the years, and have grappled with lead pollution crises in the past. The recent water shortages, one local resident told Gizmodo, are just a continuation of environmental racism that Jackson and many other nonwhite communities will continue to face as the climate crisis worsens.

JACKSON, Miss. – A water outage in Jackson, Mississippi, has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil notice has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

Officials in the city of roughly 160,000 people said the water pressure was being restored after it was depleted by a winter storm that passed through the area three weeks ago. In some pockets of the city, largely among higher elevations, residents were still experiencing little to no water pressure as of Monday.

The water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a boil notice issued Feb. 16.

Testing revealed the water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance it may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city Thursday once water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

A helping hand: As Jackson's water crisis continues, outside communities bring water to residents in need

How did this happen? Here's what to know about the water crisis in Jackson:

Feb. 16 : Weather chokes city facilities

Winter weather and icy temperatures choked equipment at water treatment plants, rendering water pressure inadequate.

Nearly 43,000 water customers were placed under a boil-water advisory.

Feb. 18 : No set timeline for restoration

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced the capital city did not have a definitive timeline for total water restoration.

Williams noted water main breaks popping up that further complicated the process of getting water to residents.

Water distribution sites began to lace the city, and fire stations made available nonpotable water for residents.

Feb. 22 : 300,000 in Mississippi under boil water advisories

The state Health Department recorded 300,000 customers under boil water advisories across Mississippi.

Convenience and grocery stores saw a surge in demand for bottled water as many residents did not have safe water. Supplies began to run low.

City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said Jackson provided more than 26,500 bottles of water and about 7,000 gallons of nonpotable water.

Feb. 23 : Governor activates Guard

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd secured tankers to provide nonpotable water. He activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.

Feb. 24 : Officials warn of water main breaks

Officials said most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week, but they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays.

Ten water distribution sites popped up.

Feb. 25 : Water pressure gradually increasing

Williams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed them to pump out more water.

Mayor Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.

March 1 : Pressure falls back; south Jackson struggles

Williams said the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. South Jackson residents struggled with a lack of water and water pressure.

Up to 80 water main breaks were reported since the storm hit. Workers mended the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials manned water distribution sites.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.

March 2 : No city data on water outages

Officials said they did not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration.

Williamssaid south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.

March 3 : Aging infrastructure at fault, official says

Water intake filters full of clams, mussels, fish and other items forced systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.

Williams confirmed more than 10,000 water customers did not have any water. Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, he said.

March 4 : An email to the governor

Media outlets get hold of an email Lumumba sent to Reeves on March 3. Lumumba requested about $47 million in emergency funding from the state and federal government to cover a wide range of projects relating to water system infrastructure.

Seeking answers from the city: Mississippi's capital city hasn't had clean water in weeks. Is there an end in sight?

State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said the Department of Health continued to monitor the quality of Jackson's water supply and was working with the city.

March 8: Low pressure, boil water advisory remained

Several residents, businesses and schools continue to deal with low water pressure.

Jackson remains under a water boil advisory because of high turbidity – cloudiness that increases the possibility water might contain disease-causing organisms.

City officials said Thursday Jackson's water system still faces numerous challenges from prolonged freezing temperatures and could not say for certain when water will be restored.

Live weather updates: Power outages skyrocket in Mississippi, many roads closed

Since Wednesday, residents across the city have been left with little to no water pressure due to issues with the city's water distribution system. The entire city remains under a boil water notice.

In light of the crisis, the city plans to distribute bottled water and non-potable water to residents at fire stations and city facilities as early as Thursday afternoon, although a specific time was unavailable.

""I owe you honesty. I owe you truth,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday at the city's Real Time Command Center. ""We do not have a definitive timeline on water restoration.""

Water shortage in Jackson: Winter weather causing water pressure issue in Jackson. Here's the latest on Wednesday

Public Works Director Charles Williams said it is possible water will be restored by this weekend, but cautioned it is not a certainty given the cold snap.

""The weather system has created havoc on the water distribution system and also on our plants,"" Williams said. ""We knew cold temperatures were coming in but didn't factor the length of time it would be here.

""We're working through different scenarios and hopefully by this weekend it'll be restored. Unfortunately, It's difficult to give a time line.""

Transportation issues have delayed the delivery of chemicals to treat the water and the supply is getting low, officials added. Another factor tied to the shortage is that residents are staying at home during the cold snap and using more water than usual.

The mayor's office in a Wednesday night press release said it has been overwhelmed with calls from residents.

The office is asking for patience and to reserve calls to the following numbers for visible water leaks or urgent needs for assistance: 601-960-1777, 601-960-1781, 601-960-1778, 601-960-0379 or 601-960-1779.

Water distribution sites

Constituent Services Manager Keisha Sanders, who is heading up the bottled water distribution effort, said the city is finalizing delivery of the water with a vendor. Transportation to Jackson has been the biggest hitch holding the delivery up, she said.

When it is available, water will be distributed from the following locations:

Smith-Wills Stadium on Lakeland Drive

Metrocenter Mall

JPD Precinct One, 810 Cooper Rd.

Virgie P. Middleton Community Center, Flag Chapel Road

Jackson Police Officers Training Academy, 3000 St. Charles Road

Willowwood Community Center, 229 Lake Cove Dr.

City of Byram Fire Station

Non-potable water, which is unsafe to drink, will be distributed at fire stations across the city except for Station 20 on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Station 10 on Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Station 22 on Lakeshore Drive.

Jackson power outages

Between 17,000 to 18,000 residents lost power Wednesday night after a second winter storm system moved in and dropped freezing rain on tree limbs and power lines.

Entergy crews are currently cutting trees and working to restore the outages which occurred in pockets across the city, Lumumba said.

The mayor clarified there have been no rolling blackouts in Jackson as there have been in other cities, despite some claims on social media.

16,3-May-21,Water Quality Products,"Jackson, Mississippi, Experiences Drinking Water Crisis","Jackson, Mississippi, experienced water issues since winter storms in mid-February, which will be addressed in a May 11 meeting concerning the water system.

Jackson, Mississippi, has been experiencing water issues since winter storms in mid-February.

The city was under a boil notice as a result. Residents experienced low pressure in faucets and in the wake of the boil notice water distribution centers cropped up in the city.

Jackson went without clean water for nearly a month, according to Good Morning America.

According to Public Works Director Charles William, water main breaks that occurred complicated the process of getting water to residents, reported Good Morning America.

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system and tweeted that he secured tankers to provide non potable water to residents. The Mississippi National Guard was activated as well to assist Jackson during the crisis.

According to a water sample taken Feb. 23, 2021, the water showed turbidity levels greater than 1.0 turbidity units, which is above the standard of 0.30 turbidity units, according to the city’s website.

According to Williams, the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. This was short-lived and the city once more began to experience low water pressure, with more than 10,000 water customers not having any water, reported USA Today.

Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, added Williams.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer Jackson residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes, reported USA Today.

Additionally, The Department of Health and the EPA inspected the city’s two water treatment plants, O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell, on Feb. 3, 2020 and found numerous violations of federal regulations governing clean drinking water.

Federal officials will address the Jackson City Council at a May 11 meeting concerning Jackson’s water system, reported The Northside Sun.

17,1-Mar-21,ABC News,Water crisis in South persists following devastating winter storm,"Half a million Texans and most of Jackson, Mississippi, are without water.

Hundreds of thousands of residents in the South are still dealing with the after effects of two devastating winter storms as cities struggle to provide drinking water.

Residents in Jackson, Mississippi, are still under a boil water alert, and some residents still do not have running water after the back-to-back winter storms last month wreaked havoc on the city's water system.

While significant progress was made Sunday on restoring pressure to the system, and water for flushing toilets was restored on Monday, the city's water system does not have a time table on when a full restoration will be complete, ABC Jackson affiliate WAPT reported. Water was previously expected to be fully restored by the end of last week, Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday.

Jackson resident Taylor Corso told ABC News that residents were so desperate to flush their toilets they collected snow and melted it in their tubs to add to the reservoir tank.,

On Wednesday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves dispatched the National Guard and more tanker trucks to Jackson to aid in the water crisis.

Corso said many people in the city do not have the means to ""just go and get bottled water"" or even go to distribution centers to fill up their own containers.

""Our most vulnerable citizens really aren't -- that's not something that's super accessible to them.""

Jackson resident Terri Hall told WAPT that water has only been dripping from her faucet and that what little comes out is mixed with sediment. She has been without water for 10 days.

""We can't bathe in this, because if there is microbes in the water, they can enter your mouth, eyes, and nose, and can't wash dishes because you don't want to ingest that way,"" she said.

Corso said in the past, problems have been solved within one to four days.

""So the time is extensive here, and it's so widespread -- I mean, tens of thousands of residents here are without any water,"" she said.

In Texas, more than half a million people are still under boil water advisories, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. At one point, more than 14.4 million people, about half of the state's population, were affected by weather-related water disruptions.

Although the boil water advisory was lifted in Houston on Feb. 21, thousands of homes are still without water after pipes burst in freezing temperatures, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced on Sunday.

""They still do not have water, so there is a tremendous need,"" Turner said.

About 10,000 people showed up to a distribution center Sunday to pick up cases of water and meal kits, Turner said.

Turner has requested more supplies from FEMA so licensed plumbers can continue to repair the pipes, according to the release.

Business agent Rick Lord told ABC Houston station KTRK that when he recently went to a local hardware store, the plumbing section was empty, describing it as ""Black Friday on steroids in the plumbing aisle.""

De’Keither Stamps in her tub. With no water pressure, the water will be used to flush the toilet. Photo : Rogelio V. Solis ( AP )

Right now, Calandra Davis’ water pressure is too low to take a shower. When she turns on her sinks, the water comes out at a slow trickle. For weeks, she’s had to bathe herself and her 6-year-old son with water from store-bought bottles. Like all residents of Jackson, Mississippi, she’s also been on a boil-water notice for a week due to high turbidity. But in many ways, she feels lucky.

“I feel like I’m privileged in that I have water at all right now and in that I didn’t go super long without water,” she said. Unlike more than 50,000 people in her city, she also didn’t lose power.

Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute and organizer with the social justice organization Black Youth Project 100, has been spending hours each day on mutual aid efforts, delivering food and water, and helping get those without utilities into hotel rooms. While working a local emergency relief hotline, she’s heard from people who are struggling because they have medical conditions that require electronic devices or water access, and from dozens whose groceries all spoiled when their power went out. She says in Jackson, the lowest-income Black communities in the south and west are facing the worst effects.

“It’s environmental racism,” she said.

Infrastructural issues in Jackson aren’t new, and they’re also not unique to the city. They’re endemic in the state, and they disproportionately affect poor, Black populations. Though the spotlight might still be on Texas, it’s clear that the infrastructure we rely on for modern life is in dire need of updates across the South. If we don’t make them, low-income people of color will continue to suffer the worst burdens.

During last month’s southern cold snap, Texas captured headlines. But Mississippi and other parts of the South faced similar frigid conditions that national news crews passed over. Some parts of the state saw their lowest temperatures in recorded history, and water systems throughout central Mississippi were thrown into complete disarray. Jackson’s main water plant was rendered inoperable by the cold. Davis lost water altogether for two days. While her water is marginally back, others are currently on their third week without any. While the weather has warmed up, people’s lives are still stuck in mid-February.

Like Texas, Mississippi is a state run by conservatives who believe in very limited government, which has made these immediate issues harder to overcome. Organizers like Davis have stepped in to help, but the lack of national attention has left them with a smaller stream of donations than those pouring into Texas organizations.

“Texas needs and deserves all of the resources and assistance that they’re getting, if not more, but I would love for people not to turn a blind eye to what’s also happening in Mississippi as well,” said Davis.

Over the past week, people have started to open their eyes as Jackson’s water crisis. But stories of other parts of Mississippi, especially its poor, rural areas home to many of the state’s people of color, are still largely absent. Nearby communities are also on boil-water notice, including Holmes County’s 98% Black Tchula and 76.2% Black Cruger, and Claireborne County’s 91.5% Black Port Gibson. Dozens of households in both counties are also still experiencing power outages, as are hundreds within Jackson.

“I want clean water and a stable system in the city of Jackson, but not only just in the city of Jackson, I want that for the rural communities that are suffering,” Danyelle Holmes, a field team lead for the Poor People’s Campaign who lives in Jackson, said. “As we speak, right now, they’re also in the same predicament.”

Last month’s cold weather was an acute shock to Mississippi’s water systems and power grid, but the ongoing damage is the product of decades of neglect and disinvestment. Without funding and support, both systems are bound to fail the people they’re supposed to serve again, especially as extreme weather becomes more common amid the climate crisis and puts increased pressure on infrastructure.

Long before the recent storm, Jackson was also often plagued by water main breaks and had reported lead concentrations in drinking water well above federal action levels, all the result of aging infrastructure. Many pipes in the city are more than a century old, and official estimates that the necessary upgrades and repairs will cost $2 billion. Jackson’s water is also frequently contaminated by agricultural runoff in the Mississippi River. On top of that, the city’s out-of-date water billing system has been a source of inaccurate bills and endless frustration, costing residents time and money for a system that’s wholly inadequate.

“Sure, right now we’re on a boil-water notice, but that happens quite frequently,” said Holmes. “And we often lose pressure at our water treatment plants, so it’s not unusual for us to experience that or be on a boil water alert. It’s not even unusual for water to be brown...or to have a smell like chlorine or even smell like sewer. On a good day we have clear water, but on a normal day the water is brown.”

The city is 82% Black with a median household income under $40,000. Research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color. While Mississippi is majority-white and a stronghold of the Republican party at the state level, Jackson’s current mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba—the son of a well-known Black revolutionary—ran on a promise to make his city “the most radical city on the planet.” Improving its infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, yet the city only has so many resources at its disposal; its operating budget is just over $350 million and only a fraction is for water and sewage. Fixing the structural problems facing Jackson’s infrastructure—to say nothing of even smaller towns in rural Mississippi—requires federal and state help. Yet state officials seem more intent on blaming city officials than working with them.

Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Tate Reeve intimated that it was city officials’ fault for these infrastructural crises on Jackson’s city leadership. But Rukia Lumumba, founder of the People’s Advocacy Institute and sister of Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, said that the state is, in fact, to blame.

“The state’s response has been significantly inadequate and neglectful,” she said. “But they blame it on the progressive, Black leadership.”



Advertisement

She noted Reeves waited until a week into the water crisis to mobilize the National Guard to help get people water for drinking, cooking, and flushing toilets. It was only Thursday that Reeves announced he requested federal aid despite the ongoing disaster.



This neglect, Lumumba said, is what she’s come to expect from Reeves. Just last year, he failed to pass a bill that would have provided funding for struggling water ratepayers and infrastructure repairs. Unlike Jackson’s city leadership, he has also consistently failed to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis, and the ways it will make those repairs and upgrades all the more urgent as it ushers in more erratic weather. That includes not just cold snaps but also heat waves that could increase water demand and increased flooding, which could strain already damaged pipes.

Advertisement

To fix all this, Rukia Lumumba said the state should make funds available immediately, not just to Jackson but also to surrounding rural communities, which are plagued with similar issues. State leaders should also increase the amount of food and water supplies they are distributing to struggling residents. Rukia Lumumba spearheaded the Mississippi Winter Storm Rapid Response Fund through which Davis and Holmes have both been distributing necessary aid, but grassroots organizers depending on donations are no replacement for state leadership and funding.



Beyond these emergency measures, she also said the state should call upon climate experts and local organizers to help determine what infrastructure repairs are needed, and should call upon federal leaders to help fund that plan. On the national level, several proposals in the works which could help secure that funding to fix infrastructure and prepare it for climate change.

Advertisement

Last week, Democratic members of Congress in both chambers reintroduced the WATER Act, which would guarantee $35 billion annually for fixing and replacing infrastructure, addressing water contamination, and providing relief to those with unaffordable water and sewage bills. The coming covid-19 economic relief package could also be an opportunity to mobilize funding to fix water systems. Doing so could also create jobs for the millions around the country who are unemployed. And President Joe Biden has promised to allocate “40% of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments” for frontline communities plagued by environmental injustice.

“To ensure that the resources are getting to the right places, you’re going to have to go to the grassroots,” Rukia Lumumba said. “You’re going to have to literally talk to the organizations and mayors and [have a] hyperlocal strategy where you’re not relying on governors to distribute resources justly, fairly, across their state.”

Advertisement

Putting conservative state leaders in charge of deciding whether or not climate relief or infrastructural funding is available to frontline communities, said Holmes, will lead to further disaster.

“It shouldn’t be a gamble of if and when the state government is going to act,” she said. “We need to fix this issue. We need to fix it now.”

19,24-Feb-21,ABC News,"Tanker trucks, National Guard dispatched to Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis","The water is not expected to be completely restored until the end of the week.

The governor of Mississippi said he's dispatching the National Guard and more tanker trucks to the state's capital city to help bring an end to a water crisis that emerged following severe winter storms that crippled the community's aging infrastructure.

Many residents of Jackson, a city of more than 160,000 people, have been struggling for over a week to secure enough water to handle basic needs, officials said.

As he waited in line at a local high school to get water from a tanker truck, Alfred Anderson Jr. summed up the feelings that he said many Jackson taxpayers have: ""This is pitiful and a shame.""

""We pay all this money ... and we have got to come out here, most of these people, and wait on to try to get stuff to flush your toilets and, you know, do your hygiene stuff and whatever,"" Anderson told ABC affiliate station WAPT in Jackson.

Casandra Woody, another Jackson resident waiting in the same line for water, said the situation ""is sad.""

""I'm just fed up,"" Woody told WAPT as she watched residents fill up as many containers that could fit in their vehicles.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

""We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix,"" Reeves said in a Tuesday night Twitter post. ""I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow (Wednesday). We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!""

Reeves noted that Jackson is one of many Mississippi cities still recovering from electrical and water emergencies.

Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday that water should be fully restored by the end of this week. But Williams said that as water pressure has been gradually increased a new problem has arisen -- busted water mains across the community. He said in recent days, city work crews have responded to fix at least 20 water main breaks.

""We had to buy some equipment in order to get where we are right now,"" Williams said. ""A lot of our equipment froze up because we could not get above 32 (degrees).""

The city's water treatment plant was knocked offline when back-to-back winter storms swept through the South last week bringing snow and below-freezing temperatures causing widespread power outages.

Williams said that at one point last week, pressure in the city's water system fell to 32 pounds per square inch. On Tuesday, he said the water pressure in the system was up to 67 PSI and that he hopes workers can get the pressure up to 80 to 85 PSI by the end of Wednesday.

Residents have been asked to boil their water before drinking and the city is establishing more locations where residents can go to get clean water.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has been the target of criticism from his constituents and city council members for his handling of the water crisis and for not getting the state moving fast enough to help fix the situation.

But Lumumba said the crisis was an ""act of God"" that exposed the city's crumbling infrastructure that he said has been neglected for decades.

Reeves agreed, saying at a news conference on Tuesday that the challenges to Jackson's water system ""were born over literally 30, 40, 50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.""

""That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we're going to fix in the next six to eight hours,"" Reeves said.","Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

20,30-Apr-21,Liberation News,"There is enough money to fix the pipes in Jackson, Mississippi – Liberation News","Representatives in Mississippi’s state legislature approved $3 million to repair the state’s water system including 46.7 million for the city of Jackson earlier this month. As of now, it is unclear how these funds will be spent.

Credit: CJ Nickell Templin

On April 13, the city approved $1.2 million to repair the O.B. Curtis water treatment facility. This was after it was revealed that the Environmental Protection Agency, sent an emergency administrative order demanding that the city to fix its water system.

The order detailed the city’s long standing water problems such as equipment failures and understaffing. It also cited health concerns like the potential for E. Coli and other pathogens in the water, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, cramps and headaches.

The money approved by the city council only repairs one facility, while these problems are in all of Jackson’s water treatment facilities.

Jackson City councilmember Kenneth Stokes has advocated for the privatization of Jackson’s water system. When talking about solutions, Stokes said, “If something different means we need to get private companies in here to run our water plant, then so be it.” (WLBT3)

But the solution is not privatization. When municipal water systems are privatized, water bills rise for the residents because state regulators let private companies earn a profit. Under capitalism, it is guaranteed that profit will be prioritized over public safety.

Because of privatization, pipes in Missoula, Mont., leaked so badly that half of the water flowing through its pipes was lost.

The truth is that all of the solutions offered by those in office are either not enough, or directly in conflict with the people’s interests. The city needs more funding and the money is there.

The money from the federal, state and local government is much less than the estimated $2 billion necessary to permanently fix the city’s damaged and aging water system. Lack of funding has been an issue for Jackson’s water infrastructure for decades.

For more than 40 years, federal funding for water infrastructure in cities all across the United States has decreased. In 1977, federal support accounted for 31 percent of cities’ total water utility spending. In the present day, it only accounts for 4 percent of spending. So for cities like Memphis, New Orleans, and Jackson, their pipes have been neglected for more than four decades. As a result, over 60 million people are exposed to unsafe drinking water each year. This is a longstanding health crisis that will take a lot of federal and state funding to resolve.

The water crisis that came as a result of February’s winter storm was the result of long term issues, and it will take comprehensive solutions to fix it. As mentioned before, it would take $2 billion to fix Jackson’s water system, making safe, and public drinking water for Jackson’s residents — not paying for water bottles or filters, just quality public water. This may be a basic necessity and human right, but where would we get the money? Why not look up at the people who suffered the least during Jackson’s water crisis. In addition, look where the city, state, and federal governments have already been spending money.

Mississippi has 47,279 millionaires. It would be safe to say that they have not been feeling the worst effects of Jackson’s water crisis. Just a 1 percent tax on them for the water pipes would produce $472 million. For Mississippi’s 2 billionaires, whose cumulative net worth amounts to $2 billion, a 2 percent tax would amount to approximately $40,000,000.

Now, let’s tax some corporate profits. The Mississippi-based Sanderson Farms, the third largest poultry producer in the United States, also produces $2.8 billion in annual profits. That is approximately an extra $40 million with a 2 percent tax.

Nationally, millionaires and billionaires saw their wealth go up by $1 trillion and collective net-worth increase by $4 trillion. A 2 percent tax on that collective net worth alone would amount to an additional $80 billion.

Just taxing the millionaires, billionaires, and Mississippi’s largest employers would be more than enough to fix Jackson’s pipes. This is much more than the $50 million that would be allocated to Jackson from the federal and state government.

But what is the local and state government spending money on? The budget for Jackson’s police department is approximately $32 million. Defunding Jackson’s police department by 25 percent would produce $8 million in revenue. The state also spends $2 million to CoreCivic, a private prison company that also houses undocumented immigrants. CoreCivic is notorious for its horrible conditions and human rights abuses in their facilities in Tallahatchie and Adams Counties; one example would be ICE agents torturing Cameroonian immigrants in Adams County. Another example would be 80 percent of inmates from Vermont testing positive for COVID-19 in Tallahatchie Correctional Facility. There are better uses for Mississippi’s money than to keep funding human rights abuses in Mississippi’s prisons; that money can go towards water and other much needed services.

On the federal level, the government definitely has the funding to repair Mississippi’s water system. The United States government’s “defense” budget is as high as the next seven countries’ military expenditures combined. Congress also gave $738 billion for defense spending, to bankroll war and occupation abroad.

The bottom line is that there is enough money to fix Jackson’s water problem; there is just not the political will from politicians at the city, state, and national level. In Mississippi, as with the United States as a whole, profits are prioritized over people. In order to reverse this reality, and get the rich, the corporations, and government to help fix Jackson’s pipes, then the people must start demanding the government to hand it over at all levels.","As mentioned before, it would take $2 billion to fix Jackson’s water system, making safe, and public drinking water for Jackson’s residents — not paying for water bottles or filters, just quality public water.
It would be safe to say that they have not been feeling the worst effects of Jackson’s water crisis.

Jackson State coach Deion Sanders is all in on the city of Jackson.

The first-year coach told local reporters Saturday that the Tigers' 33-27 win over Grambling State was for the capital city of the Magnolia State.

Many citizens have gone almost three weeks without clean water since winter storms swept the area.

STATEMANT MADE: Deion Sanders proves something to all of us in statement win at Grambling

""The city of Jackson, Mississippi and I want you to get this,"" Sanders said. ""This city of Jackson, Mississippi is so resilient. Do you know what we've been up against? The city. With the water problems and electrical problems and some of the elderly not receiving water, not being able to bathe. We got our butts out there and went to a nursing home this week to make sure they had water. They're so resilient, and no one's complaining. To have the city ride like that, and we just give them a little more hope, we got you. We got you. We're going to ride with you as well.""

Sanders brought up Jackson twice again unprompted before the end of the press conference. He compared his team's effort to close out a game to the city's residents. Saturday's matchup came down to the final two minutes as Grambling State was on JSU's goal line before the reigning SWAC Defensive Player of the Year came up with a fumble recovery to seal the victory.

""I learned that these guys are resilient, just like the city of Jackson. They're resilient,"" Sanders said. ""They really are, and they won't give up. They got fight in them.""

JSU (2-0, 1-0 SWAC) wasted little time getting back to campus after Saturday's win, as players weren't available to speak with the local media postgame to get back sooner. After celebrating the win this weekend, the attention shifts to the Tigers' next opponent, which is in-state rival Mississippi Valley State.

""Jackson, Mississippi,"" Sanders said before he pumped his fists. ""Jackson State, Thee I Love. I love it. Quote me on that.""

Kick off against the Delta Devils is at 1 p.m. on March 14 at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium.

22,23-Feb-21,WLBT,Gov. Reeves activates Miss. National Guard to assist with Jackson water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Update: Governor Tate Reeves has announced that he has activated the Mississippi National Guard to help with the City of Jackson’s water crisis.

He said in a tweet, “We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix. I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow. We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!”

--- Original Story Below---

Gov. Tate Reeves is denying reports that he has been dodging communication with Jackson’s Mayor Antar Lumumba.

This after an impassioned press conference Tuesday in which Lumumba discussed “chronicling” difficulties getting in touch with Reeves through the past year.

Lumumba also said that because of this “challenge” reaching the governor, he has resorted to contacting Reeves’ chief of staff because of their having a “prior relationship” and because this is the person Lumumba can get in contact with.

Reeves, though, denied these claims by Lumumba.

According to the governor, although he understands that Lumumba is experiencing a lot of pressure and is “getting attacked from all sides” due to the mass water outages impacting the Capital City, his saying that he couldn’t get in touch with Reeves “wasn’t accurate.”

“The first I heard from the mayor was at 1:38 p.m. yesterday afternoon via text,” Reeves stated. “I immediately responded. But all of that is semantics.”

The governor then shifted, saying that what is important is “getting the people that need help, help.”

Reeves said that many of the challenges facing Jackson are not new but were born over decades of negligence.

“That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something we are going to fix in the next six to eight hours,” he continued.

Reeves was later asked if he should have been the one reaching out to Lumumba first given that Reeves lives in Jackson and that he is the “state leader.”

“Well sure,” Reeves responded. “We reach out and talk to local officials all the time,” adding that he gets a status report every few hours on any unmet needs and any asks made of the state.

“I don’t think it would be fair to characterize it any other way than I have been fully aware on every-other-hour basis over the last ten days of the challenges that are faced in every community throughout our state,” Reeves said.

The governor also said that the people of Mississippi have a significant investment in the City of Jackson and that “it has not been easy to operate state government because of the lack of water” and made it clear that “the state does not run the water system in the City of Jackson.”

“Perhaps we should,” Reeves suggested. “Perhaps we oughta look at things to see what happens going forward...”

City officials announced distribution sites for water in an update on the city's water shortage that has now stretched into a tenth day.

Officials have said a majority of the city will see water restored by today, but cautioned that could be further delayed by water main breaks.

Friday morning, some areas of west and south Jackson remained without water. Public Works Director Charles Williams said water will be restored to those residents, but did not have a specific timeframe.

""We're seeing gradual progress,"" Williams said. ""Some areas without water yesterday have water today, so we can expect to see that for all residents.""

Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay on Friday was handing out cases of bottled water in the southern part of her ward still without water. She said other higher-elevated areas of Ward 7, including the Fondren business district and Millsaps College, started to see some water pressure on Thursday.

Councilman De'Keither Stamps said many residents in his ward in west and south Jackson were without water or had low water pressure as well.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil-water notice. Testing has revealed the city's water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance the water may contain disease-causing organisms.

Water distribution sites in Jackson

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Friday.

Officials have purchased 45 pallets of bottled water and is continuing efforts to source more.

Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said more distribution sites for bottled water could come and city leaders will notify residents when water is available.

Gov. Tate Reeves said the state has acquired more tanker trucks of non-potable water to be delivered to the city. In addition, resources from the Mississippi National Guard have also been deployed in Jackson to assist residents.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations, mostly in Jackson and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Friday:

Forest Hill High School — 2607 Raymond Rd.

Garbage pickup

Waste Management has resumed regularly scheduled collection services, but is experiencing high volumes of garbage and trash along all routes, which may cause some delays in service. Any routes not completed on schedule will become first priority the next morning, the mayor's office said.

Waste Management said it anticipates all routes, including residential, commercial and roll-off, to be recovered by the end of the week.

The city is asking residents to only place household garbage out for both collection days this week in an effort to prevent heavy loads. It asks for residents to hold bulk items and yard debris for next week.

Waste Management will begin removing tree limbs and debris beginning next week. It is asking residents to exercise the following guidelines:

Limbs should be cut into four-foot long segments and stacked in small piles no higher than three feet.

If cut by paid contractors, the contractors are responsible for properly removing limbs.

The city will provide dumpsters for storm debris only this Saturday at the Metro Center Mall in the Old Dillard’s parking lot at 3645 Hwy 80 from 8 a.m. until noon.

Residents are asked to call the city's solid waste department at 601-960-1193 for more information.

Numbers to call

The city says it is still overwhelmed by calls to 311. It advises residents to reserve calls to the city hotline for water main breaks.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

Eddie Staten pushed a grocery cart nearly a mile to the Mississippi College School of Law on Sunday for one reason — to find clean water.

Staten is one of the thousands of people in Jackson who were affected by the massive water outage after two winter storms swept through Mississippi in mid-February. Nearly three weeks later, pockets of the city still have no service.

He's one of the luckier ones — his water has returned. But Staten said his pressure is low and his toilet still doesn't flush. And sometimes when he turns the faucet on, the water comes out brown.

""We don't drink (tap water) because we don't trust it,"" Staten said. ""Everybody said it's contaminated and not to drink it.""

The latest on Jackson's water crisis: Officials say progress being made as residents still without water

Staten and others like him are the reason Jeffery Land, a Memphis, Tennessee, attorney, organized members of the Leo Bearman, Sr. American Inn of Courts — an organization of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals — to come together to bring more than 1,900 cases of bottled water to Jackson.

When the storms hit, Land said he was also under a boil water advisory, but his problems resolved after a few days. He said he's never heard of an outage lasting nearly as long as the one in Jackson and felt compelled to help.

""I saw the news story and figured I needed to do something,"" he said.

Land said after talking with others in the organization, he spoke with his father, Jeff Land, and began coordinating how to bring water to the Charles Clark American Inn of Courts in Jackson.

Jeff Land said the organization acquired the water in a matter of days and a local trucking company — Milan Supply Chain Solutions — offered to transport it.

""I sent a text to the CEO, Michael McLarty, ... and he called me three minutes later and said it's a done deal,"" he said.

Land was able to set up a distribution site in the parking lot of the Mississippi College School of Law on East Griffith Street because the college hosts the Jackson branch. Only 30 minutes after distribution started, organizers estimated 50 cars had already come through to get water.

Land isn't the only person to bring outside help to Jackson. The New Orleans Pelicans basketball team donated two truckloads of water on Monday, which were distributed by the city. The athletics department at the University of Mississippi, in partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, also hosted a water drive during its recent series of baseball games against Belmont to contribute to the cause.

District 4 Chancery Court Judge Crystal Wise Martin, who was at the site Sunday with her family to help with distribution, said it felt good to see people willing to come together to help Jackson when it needed it the most.

""I'm just so warm that people are coming out ... to help people,"" she said. ""That's what life is really all about.""

During a news conference Friday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said pressure at the plant was improving and only pockets in south Jackson were still without service. Testing of the city's well water system to see if the boil advisory can be lifted began Friday. The surface water system will be tested when pressure levels stay stable for at least 48 hours, officials said.

Water supply has been returned to many who lost it during last week's snow and ice storms across the South, officials reported.

And boil-water advisories are starting to evaporate across southwestern Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, the officials said.

But a water-fueled political spat in capitol city Jackson, Mississippi, grew in intensity as the mayor and a council member traded accusations in dueling press conferences.

Here's a look across the region:

Memphis:

Water pressure readings in this southwestern Tennessee city improved throughout the day Wednesday, sparking optimism that a citywide boil-water advisory would be lifted soon.

""This is probably the most optimistic I've been all week,"" Memphis Light, Gas and Water CEO J.T. Young said Wednesday afternoon at a press conference.

The utility issued a boil water advisory last Thursday after extreme cold temperatures gripped much of the Mid-South.

The combination of customers leaving their faucets running to prevent them from freezing, dozens of broken water mains, and frozen reservoirs led to low water pressure across the city.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba unloaded a slew of grievances against Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes at a press conference Tuesday. The mayor accused Stokes of spreading misinformation — about the water shortage and other issues — for years.

Stokes was expected to respond with his own press conference Wednesday afternoon.

28,28-Feb-21,WLBT,‘Our system basically crashed like a computer:’ Jackson Public Works Dir. said progress made in restoring water to residents,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson provided an update on the ongoing water crisis that began following a lengthy winter storm.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba gave an update Sunday discussing efforts to restore water to residents who’ve been without it for nearly two weeks.

The mayor and public works director say the city is making progress when it comes to fully restoring everyone’s water.

However, right now some residents in South and West Jackson are still without water, and at this time Lumumba said he can’t give an exact date on when it’ll be restored.

“Time is really the solution to much of this,” the mayor said. “While we can’t give you a precise day and hour in which that water will come on, what we’re confident in is that they are working the system as it should be, they are resolving the issues.”

The city says the water system is slowly making progress.

Williams says the pressure has reached 90 psi (pounds per square inch) and they are working to stabilize the pressure.

“Water has been restored to certain areas, what we’re trying to narrow down is, where are those areas that are still possibly without water,” said Williams. “Right now what we know is there are some pockets in West Jackson, and there are some areas in South Jackson.”

The public works director says they’re now trying to get enough water pressure to fill the more than a dozen storage tanks throughout the city.

This will then allow water to migrate down to the homes in South and West Jackson that currently have no water.

“We just left Forest Hill Road, so those residents are without,” said Williams. “We also left the area of Brookleigh and they’re without water currently right now. We know that we need to continue to push pressure through the system and flow water down consistently in order to continue to build the restoration efforts for getting our residents water, so that’s just part of the entire recovery.”

The entire city has been under a Boil Water Alert for more than two weeks and those with water have been asked to conserve.

“Our system basically crashed like a computer and we’re trying to rebuild it,” said Williams.

The city is making efforts to deliver water to those in need. Sites have been set up across the city for residents to pick up free water.

Governor Tate Reeves has activated the National Guard to help speed up the recovery efforts for the city’s water system.

As this crisis continues, it sheds another light on the city’s aging infrastructure.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said recently that it would literally cost more than a billion dollars to replace the entire water system.

He has been vocal about criticism to the city’s response to the crisis saying that what caused the outages and warnings was not incompetence but “an act of God.”

Jackson, Mississippi, is finally on its way out of a nightmare water crisis.

Freezing winter storms wreaked havoc on Jackson’s old and crumbling water infrastructure. In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water. But while the Texas blackouts dominated the news cycle, Jackson’s water crises received far less attention, even as it extended into its fourth week. Jackson’s residents, 80 percent of whom are Black and nearly 30 percent of whom live below the poverty line, have been forced to boil water to drink, bathe, and use the bathroom. They’ve collected rainwater to flush their toilets and bought bottled water to brush their teeth. In the middle of a pandemic, residents of Jackson haven’t had reliable access to clean water to wash their hands.

This water crisis was years in the making. For the past 50 years the Republican-led state government has been cutting taxes and neglecting to invest in infrastructure repairs. Jackson’s shrinking tax base has been exacerbated by white flight and the fact that, unlike other capital cities, Jackson doesn’t make money off property taxes for state-owned buildings. The city of Jackson has a $300 million budget. According to Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Jackson’s wastewater and drinking water systems require at least $2 billion of repairs.

“It isn’t a matter of if these systems will fail, it’s a matter of when these systems will fail,” Lumumba tells Nathalie Baptiste on the Mother Jones Podcast. “Pipes were bursting throughout the system because they are over 100 years. They’re like peanut brittle.”

On March 17, the city of Jackson Mississippi finally lifted its boil water notice. But Jackson’s water crisis laid bare the budget, infrastructure, and equity issues that leave cities like Jackson vulnerable to future extreme weather events.

“Climate change is significantly impacting the pressure on our infrastructure. We have hotter summers, colder winters, and more rain in the rainy season,” say’s Mayor Lumumba. “They’re becoming our new normal.”","In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water.

EPA administrators in their first public appearance with city officials said it will take both short-term and long-term fixes to remedy the system, a prospect that will require millions of dollars of funding.

The visit follows an inspection by the federal agency, along with the state Department of Health, in February of last year that found several severe violations at the city's two water treatment plants, the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility and the J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Facility.

The health department, which oversees water quality across the state, later referred the inspection findings back to the EPA to take the lead on enforcement, and the EPA sent the city a list of required fixes, although no time table was cited.

The deficiencies at the plant, which ranged from a shortage of operators to malfunctioning equipment, raised immediate concerns about the reliability of the system to provide safe drinking water, said Carol Kemker, the director of the Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division of the agency.

The concerns prompted an emergency order under the Safe Drinking Water Act, she warned the council, which is meant to stem ""an impending dangerous condition from materializing or reduce or eliminate a dangerous situation.""

The city will be under the order until the EPA determines all violations have been rectified. Neither Kemker nor city officials said when they expect that to happen. The city will likely have to address the order in both the short-term and long-term, meaning it could be years before Jackson gets a clean bill of health from the agency, she said.

""It will take several years to complete work necessary to repair and rehabilitate the drinking water system here,"" she said.

While most of the violations cited the city's treatment plants, Kemker said the EPA was concerned with the city's water quality, in particular the level of turbidity, or cloudiness, and sediment in the water system that can contain or conceal bacteria and viruses.

But when asked, she said the water in Jackson is safe to drink.

""The water is safe to drink in the immediate time frame. We'd like to try and minimize the boil water notices,"" she said.

Kemker said the city has notified the EPA of its progress on fixing the system, as required by federal law, and the two parties meet twice weekly to determine the steps to fix the city's system.

The city's sewage system is under a close to billion dollar consent decree from the EPA for violations of the Clean Water Act.

The mayor's administration requested $47 million worth of funding from the state to address the specific deficiencies listed by the EPA in the midst of the water crisis. It has also applied for federal grants. The city was recently awarded over $43 million in coronavirus-related funds from the federal government as part of the American Rescue Plan. The funds can be used toward water infrastructure, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The inspection and subsequent warning preceded the water crisis leading to questions of whether it could have been prevented.

Public Works Director Charles Williams maintains the system was bound to crash given the scale of the issues and the lack of funding to address them.

Freezing temperatures crippled the city's water treatment plants leading to the worst water crisis in recent history. While other cities suffered similar problems with their water systems, some Jackson residents remained without water for weeks, and a citywide boil water notice extended for nearly a month.

31,16-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,Hyde-Smith proposes federal funding to address Jackson water crisis,"In response to the ongoing water crisis in Jackson, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced legislation Tuesday that would authorize federal funding for water infrastructure upgrades.

The Emergency Water Infrastructure Improvements Act taps three federal agencies to provide the city with a combination of loans, loan forgiveness and grants for water infrastructure projects. This federal response comes as state lawmakers weigh their options for addressing the crisis in the final weeks of the 2021 legislative session.

“Providing safe and reliable drinking water is a local responsibility, but there are federal programs and funds available that can be used to address these types of problems. I cannot sit back and watch Jackson schools, businesses and residents go without water,” Hyde-Smith said in a press release announcing the bill.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and tens of thousands of residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, city officials say “most” residents have had water service restored, though the entire city is still under a boil water notice.

Jxn's water woes became a crisis with the Feb. ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglect. I’ve introduced legislation to authorize a federal approach to help the @CityOfJxnMS work toward fixing the problem… — U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (@SenHydeSmith) March 16, 2021

In her announcement, Hyde-Smith joined the chorus of elected officials misrepresenting the current crisis as solely a failure of local leadership.

“The weeks of hardship on Jackson residents is upsetting and completely unacceptable. Jackson’s water woes became a crisis with the February ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglecting necessary repairs and maintenance,” Hyde-Smith said. “It’s time to put that neglect behind us and work toward fixing the problem.”

Under Hyde-Smith’s bill, different levels and types of funding would come through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Economic Development Administration (EDA). Here’s what each of them would provide:

An additional $22 million in funding will be authorized for Jackson under the Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program.

The Corps would be able to use these additional funds to assist in the design and construction of environmental infrastructure projects.

An additional $150 million in funding will be added to the EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF). With these funds, the EPA makes grants to States, which in turn issues loans to municipalities for drinking water improvements.

It is unclear how much of this funding would be directed to Mississippi, much less Jackson. The entire state of Mississippi received just $26,315,000 of the $2.7 billion in DWSRF funding made available in 2020.

Public water systems deemed eligible for this additional funding will be designated as “disadvantaged communities,” which qualifies them for loan subsidization and principal forgiveness. Eligible systems are also required to be located within states that had at least five major disasters in 2020 and suffered damages to water systems in recent winter storms.

The bill also stipulates that a maximum of 15% of these DWSRF funds can be used to purchase and install new water meters and modernize water billing systems. The city is currently running at a deficit of around $2 million each month in water collections revenue after a failed contract with the company Siemens left the city with more faulty water meters and billing issues than the city had before hiring them to overhaul these systems.

The bill directs the Secretary of Commerce to direct no less than $25 million in EDA Economic Adjustment Assistance(EAA) grant funds to “eligible systems.”

This funding would come from EAA grant funding from the CARES Act that has yet to be appropriated.

Other Mississippi lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to sign on to Hyde-Smith’s proposal. In her announcement, Hyde-Smith emphasized a need for bipartisan support to get the legislation passed.

“It is a responsible and worthwhile plan that will require the support of the Democrats in Congress and the administration to get it done, and I look forward to their cooperation,” Hyde-Smith said.

32,22-Mar-21,Slate,"Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis: Crumbling infrastructure in the rural South is a racial justice issue.","Residents of Mississippi’s capital endured weeks this winter without clean running water. A combination of bad weather and failed infrastructure meant thousands of people in the mostly Black city of Jackson spent weeks without the essential resource in February and early March. Residents had to rely on donated water for everyday tasks. While it seems like Jackson’s immediate water crisis is getting resolved, many Black communities in the rural South and elsewhere struggle to get access to clean water every day. It’s a complicated problem that doesn’t get the same national attention as other racial justice priorities.

On Friday’s episode of A Word, I spoke with Catherine Coleman Flowers, who is working to change that. She’s the author of Waste: One Woman’s Fight Against America’s Dirty Secret and a winner of a 2020 MacArthur “Genius Grant.” Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Jason Johnson: What are some of the issues with infrastructure, communication, and government that led to this happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is actually a state capital?

Catherine Coleman Flowers: What’s happening in Jackson is not unusual. I believe that what we will find in a lot of these areas, especially in the South, is the type of benign neglect of these cities. Benign neglect means there’s an intentional avoidance of putting the type of dollars in infrastructure—in these Southern communities, it’s not coming from the tax base because the tax base is not there. A lot of it comes from the federal government, but it’s those cities that have lobbyists or political connections that get the money over and over again. We have to change that paradigm.

One of the things that I’ve read about Jackson was the mayor was quoted and he talks about how brittle the pipes were. The infrastructure that was probably put in Jackson was put in there when Jackson was white predominantly. It probably has not been replaced, and the local community cannot afford to replace it. But we have to do something about this because Jackson’s not the only one. It’s like with Flint and the lead problem. Flint was just the canary in the coal mine. There’s lead issues throughout the United States that have not been addressed. And likewise, there are infrastructure water issues throughout the United States. When you look at Jackson, Jackson was also the convergence of poor infrastructure and climate change. We’re going to see more climate events, but these extreme weather patterns are going to expose, like COVID did, all of these disparities as it relates to infrastructure issues.

Advertisement

Have you seen climate change make clean water access even harder for rural Black communities?

Yes, in California, Allensworth in the Central Valley, because of the water being used by the farming industry there. There’s a Black community that historically was the first Black community in California funded by Black folk, and now, they can’t drink the water because the water is full of arsenic that’s naturally forming. The parts of the arsenic is greater than the parts of the water, so therefore, they can’t drink it.

So when it comes to this kind of activism, we always hear about famous white women. They get movies. We have Silkwood. We’ve got Erin Brockovich. But we don’t hear often about the Black women who are on the ground doing this kind of work. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you saw in Lowndes County, Alabama, and how your activism began on environmental justice issues?

Advertisement

Well, my activism began on environmental justice issues because I came from activist parents. When I moved back to Lowndes County in 2000, I ran into the fact that there were Black people that were being arrested because they could not afford an on-site septic system. A lot of the people that are in rural communities are not in incorporated areas. All the laws are written to support municipalities, but in a rural community, generally, there’s no wastewater treatment, no decentralized system. I live in Montgomery, Alabama, and we have a decentralized system, and all I had to do when I bought a house was just move into the house and pay to have my water turned on. Or if I was building a house in Montgomery, it would just connect to the decentralized system.

“When infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities.” — Catherine Coleman Flowers

However, in rural communities like Lowndes County, the homeowner is responsible for their own decentralized system. These systems in Lowndes County are very, very expensive, especially if you’re a poor family. To give you an example, last year we were trying to work with a family prior to COVID to get a septic system for them. They built down 25 inches, in this case, and struck water. The system that she would have needed would have cost $28,000. You don’t go to the bank and borrow that. Even if it’s $6,000 for a septic system, there’s no financing for it. A mobile home can come with the plumbing, the indoor plumbing, the toilets. You can connect it to a straight pipe or PVC pipe and have it protruding from the home. When they flush the toilet, it goes out on top of the ground. That’s one of the things, and they have criminalized that here in the state of Alabama and in a lot of states. Then the second problem is people that have septic systems that have failed. When they fail, they can also be criminalized for that. I got involved back in 2002. I had gone to visit a husband and wife who had been arrested because they had a failing septic system. And then later, we found out that there were lots of people in the county that either had already been arrested or were facing arrest because they did not have a working septic system. So I got involved by stopping the criminalization, at least in Lowndes County, of poor people who could not afford on-site sanitation.

It would seem to me also that this is a structural issue. Because as Black folk were segregated or kept out of certain neighborhoods in certain places in the South, they weren’t able to live in places that were incorporated that had plumbing systems. So you’re not only being punished through white supremacy and segregation forcing you out, but you’re then being fined and criminalized again when you have to provide resources for yourself that other people are getting through tax money.

Yes, Montgomery at one point was one of the top slave trading places in this country. That is why the lynching memorial, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, is located in Montgomery. When you walk from the river in Montgomery and walk down Commerce Street, those buildings, a lot of them, were slaveholding pens. People were auctioned off at Court Square, which is not far from the Rosa Parks Museum.

Advertisement

Those of us that are part of that heritage, our families ended up in places like Lowndes County. When I go back and look at the census records, I see that our families have been there since the early 1800s, in some cases. So these rural communities, there’s a legacy and traditions where there are churches and schools and graveyards where people have been there forever. But when infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities, and the communities that were left out were those communities of color. That is a major problem that we see in the South around infrastructure and environmental justice.

Advertisement

Catherine, you’ve worked with Democrats and Republicans. I mean, on all sides. You’ve worked with Bernie Sanders. You worked with [former Alabama Senator] Jeff Sessions, who’s the last person on the planet who I would ever think would care anything about the struggles of rural Black people. I got to ask you, when you’re dealing with these powerful political leaders in and out of office, when they come to you and say, “What can I do to help?,” what’s the first thing that you tell them?

Advertisement

With Jeff Sessions, the way it happened, I just happened to be at a town hall meeting. I was the economic development coordinator for the county. He was a U.S. senator, and he talked about the type of grants that were available. And then I asked the question, “You mentioned these grants, but how do poor communities get access to them if they have to pay a match?” He came to me afterward and said, “I’ve always wanted to know the answer to that. I’m from Wilcox County, Alabama. I grew up poor. We didn’t have a television in our house until I was 10 years of age.” That’s how we started our conversation. We had to be human first. And from that point, he was very helpful. Hyundai had decided it was going to locate in Alabama, in Montgomery. At that time, when they decided to locate there, the state officials weren’t taking them to Lowndes County at all. When they had the groundbreaking ceremony, everybody was from Eastern Alabama, and there was nobody with a shovel that was Black. All the Black people kind of huddled together and everybody was saying, “Lowndes County’s right over there. Why is there nobody here from Lowndes County with a shovel?” Ultimately, I was able to help recruit tier 1 suppliers to Hyundai to Lowndes County. But we needed the infrastructure. We didn’t have industrial development parks or anything like that. Sen. Sessions was very helpful in that.

Advertisement

In terms of Bernie Sanders, he actually came to visit Lowndes County. He went to the home of Pamela Rush, who I write about in my book. I felt that you cannot understand inequality unless you see it for yourself. So to come into her home and see how she was living in a dilapidated mobile home that she still owed money on, that did not appreciate in value—living with two children, one child sleeping on a CPAP machine—Bernie Sanders said to me, “Catherine, now I understand when you talk about the intersection of climate change and environmental justice and racial justice.” Because I told his people, “I have to plan this trip because I want to make sure it’s not going to be a photo-op. He’s going to actually go and see people and see the situation so that he can know what kind of policies we need to have in place to address this.” I didn’t have an ask other than for him to come and see. And then once he saw and he was looking at what resources or what ways he could potentially help, and it has led to a shift in government policy that I could not have even imagined when I made that request for him to come and see.

33,16-Mar-21,Forbes,"Jackson, Mississippi, Hasn't Had Clean Water For A Month After Winter Storm","Topline

Most residents of Jackson, Mississippi—the state's capital and largest city—have now gone an entire month without access to clean water in their homes, as a citywide boil water advisory remains in place after a historic winter storm last month, which crippled a water system Jackson officials said had been neglected for decades.

Key Facts

Boil water advisories first went out in Jackson on Feb. 16 after a massive winter storm and record-breaking cold took a major toll on infrastructure across the South. While other major water and power systems have managed to come back online across the region, testing in Jackson has continued to show the system isn't clear of potentially having dangerous organisms, leading to the boil water advisory remaining in place. Many residents went without access to running water at all or dealt with low water pressure after the winter storm, leading to distribution centers being set up for residents to retrieve water to bathe with or flush their toilets. Running water has been restored to nearly all residents, but a small number have continued to go without, according to the Clarion-Ledger. Officials hope to lift the boil water advisory in the coming days, the newspaper reported.

Big Number

43,000. That's how many households use the city's surface water system, all of whom have been asked to boil water before use. Those households—many of which having multiple people living under the same roof—represent much of the city's approximately 160,000 residents. A well-based water system serving about 16,000 customers in the southern part of Jackson and neighboring Byram, Mississippi, was cleared of the boil water advisory last week.

What To Watch For

City officials, including Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D), have blamed years of neglect and a declining tax base over the years caused by white flight as contributing to a water system that was ill-prepared for the winter weather. On March 3, Lumumba reportedly sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves (R) requesting $47 million to improve the city's water system.

Surprising Fact

Reeves has not yet put in a request for a federal disaster declaration, according to the Clarion-Ledger. He has until Sunday to do so.

Key Background

February brought a rare series of winter storms across the South and a deep freeze during the middle of the month which broke some record lows that had stood for more than a century. The record cold would take a heavy toll on infrastructure systems ill-prepared for those conditions. One of the clearest examples came from Texas, where the state's electrical grid was pushed to the brink of complete failure, leading to rolling blackouts for millions. The aftermath has seen political battles over the state's electrical grid, lawsuits over excessive electric bills and major electric companies filing for bankruptcy.

35,26-Mar-21,WBUR,"The Jackson, Mississippi Water Crisis And America's Crumbling Water System","""And the city itself, because, like so many cities in the U.S., because of flight, and disinvestment and losing the tax base. And in this case, losing 40,000 residents, taking us from 200,000 to 160,000. But we still have a huge land mass of city with these outdated pipes under them. So we can't pay, we can't afford to keep it up. ... It's a systemic breakdown of federal, state and local municipal areas being able to work together to solve problems together on basic things like infrastructure.""

Donna Ladd : “To use words that my reporter Nick Judin used, it's a complex system collapse. And when we say that, it's not just the technological part of the system. It's the fact that we've known this for years, it's coming in one way or another. I mean, we know it. There was a big 2013 study that warned about all of these things. So we know the conditions of them. But there's a systemic breakdown in the willingness to actually do something about it.

For a month, residents of Jackson, Mississippi went without clean running water. The city's mayor says the problem's decades in the making. That makes Jackson a lesson for the entire country. We talk America's crumbling water system.

What has the city of Jackson done over the past couple of decades to attend to this known problem?

Donna Ladd: “I think the best way to break it down is to say staunching the bleeding, Band-Aid approach as far as the city itself is concerned. I mean, I can't ... sit here and blame a city that is as beleaguered as our city has been for not having the resources to be able to overhaul the water system.

""Some of the numbers that we've come up with, the least amount that they need is $600 million. And then, as you said earlier, it keeps climbing from there. I mean, if the money's not here, the money's not here. So what that means is that the state should be at the same table with the city, side by side. This is the capital city.

“You know, the state is no stronger than its capital city. That's absurd. And so they should be side by side with the city saying, OK, how are we going to work together to get federal help? What is it that we can do? How can we help? But the opposite happens. You know, one of the things our governor said just recently was, Well, you know, Jackson residents should pay their water bill, so they should go collect the water bill.

""Well, there's a whole issue around faulty billing that we've been through. But beyond that, it's like the city tried to get the state, and the state legislature passed legislation to allow payment plans for the water bill. And the governor vetoed it last year. And so that's like working against us, and so the money doesn't come in. But the water billing money is not enough to pay for what we're talking about here.

""And we have to work with the federal government, as we've discovered. A lot of the disinvestment and helping municipal areas across the country came during the '80s and particularly the Reagan era. Which was kind of pulling back on financial assistance, for environmental improvements, those kinds of things. And that is one of those perfect storm moments where it got so much worse afterwards as far as not being able to pay for things. And so when you've got everybody working against each other, or ignoring each other, then it's a terrible situation.""

We keep using this phrase 'crumbling.' Is that a fair description of some of these water systems?

Aaron Packman: ""Most of the infrastructure we have in the eastern half of the United States is quite old. Just for point of comparison, I live in Chicago. We're still using the water intakes from Lake Michigan that were built in the 1960s. And in places like Philadelphia, the water infrastructure goes back 300 years. So clearly infrastructure that age needs a lot of maintenance to work properly. And it's very hard to do, because most of the pipes are underground and inaccessible. So we definitely have an issue with its aging, deteriorating water infrastructure in a lot of the country.”

Where should early targets be for the federal government if it's going to pump a whole lot of money into infrastructure?

Catherine Coleman-Flowers: “First of all, those people that never got the infrastructure should get it first. So, I mean, in this conversation we were talking about municipalities when most of the United States is rural. And most of them are not in municipalities. So should they still be denied access to infrastructure, especially water and wastewater infrastructure? And we're seeing in some places, I'm actually doing a project right now with The Guardian where we are documenting wastewater problems throughout the United States, it's not just a one situation. It's not just Jackson, Mississippi. It's not just even Detroit, which is having a lot of issues and water shut offs.

""And if we shut off the water, you shut off sanitation. And I think the other thing that we have to do is make sure that the policy makers, if we're going to have solutions, we cannot separate wastewater from water. Because a lot of people in their mind, because they can flush the toilets, they assume that everybody else in the U.S. can do the same thing. That's the reason why we were able to do a study to show that there was hookworm in Lowndes County. And it's probably in other areas, too. We just haven't looked for it yet. So that's the first thing we need to do, give it to places that don't have it.

""We also need to identify where those places are. There are no accurate numbers on how many people do not have wastewater sanitation, because that was taken off the census in the 1990s. So if we're going to make decisions based on what numbers we have, we're still going to leave a lot of people behind. And a lot of these people are in rural communities, or they are poor people or people of color. And we have to unpack and unfold that.

""And I think we can't talk about infrastructure, and where the dollars are going or where they have gone, unless we deal with the social justice issues around those decisions. Because to people who are not like me, they see it just as simply a political decision. But socially, it has an impact on people that look like me. And we need to make sure that our voices are heard and that part of the solution is getting those dollars to those communities that have been left behind.”

Aaron Packman: ""This is a rare opportunity, because you don't usually have these problems get elevated to the presidential level and a commitment to make an investment. So I would advocate for modernization of our wastewater treatment facilities, a lot of which used 50-year-old plus technology. And also fixing some of the hard problems with the water distribution system and also the wastewater system, the things that are less accessible, that often get ignored and are not fully maintained. So this will be expensive, but it will make a big difference.""

36,19-Feb-21,The Guardian,Biden to declare major disaster in Texas as millions hit by water shortages,"Joe Biden said on Friday he was ready to declare a major disaster in Texas after a deadly winter storm cut power and disrupted water supplies for millions across the state.

Biden said the declaration, which follows a request from the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, would open up broader federal aid for immediate and long-term recovery efforts.

A presidential visit to the state is being planned for next week.

“As I said when I ran, I’m going to be a president for all Americans,” said Biden, who won November’s election without winning Texas, of his plans. “If I can do it without creating a burden for folks, I plan on going.”

Biden has asked his team to expedite Texas’s request for a disaster declaration, clearing the way for more federal resources, the White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, told reporters.

The White House later said in a statement that Biden called the acting administrator at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), Bob Fenton, to let him know he would approve the measure as soon as the agency forwarded a formal request.

The White House has been in touch with mayors in Texas cities, including Houston and Austin, and officials in Dallas and other counties, to make sure they were connected to Fema and had access to federal government resources, an administration official said separately.

As cold weather began to abate in Texas, power was being restored across the state, but millions of people remained without safe drinking water throughout the US south as the region struggled to recover from a crippling week of winter weather.

About 370,000 households remained without power in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Friday morning, with millions in the region under water-boil advisories, after record low temperatures damaged pipes and infrastructure throughout the southern United States.

In Texas, almost half the state’s residents, about 13 million people, remained under boil advisories, with over 700 water supply systems affected, according to an update from the Texas commission on environmental quality on Thursday. In Austin alone, the state’s capital, the city reported losing 325m gallons of water due to burst pipes.

In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city’s 150,000 residents were without water on Thursday night. Jackson’s mayor, Antar Lumumba, told a press conference the city faced a shortage of chemicals to treat the water, despite pumping efforts to refill city tanks.

In Louisiana, about a million residents were without clean water on Thursday, with 98 water supply systems out across the state, according to the governor, John Bel Edwards. On Thursday, Biden approved a disaster declaration for the state. The president authorized a similar disaster declaration for Texas earlier in the week, allowing Fema to coordinate disaster relief efforts in the state.

Late on Thursday, Abbott announced the state had sought another major disaster declaration which would “allow eligible Texans to apply for assistance to help address broken pipes and related property damage”, according to a press release.

Abbott also announced he would ask the legislature “to mandate the winterization of Texas’s power system and for the legislature to ensure the necessary funding for winterization”.

The frigid temperatures have moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the north-east as the extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 58 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond and 17-year-old Oklahoma girl who fell into a frozen pond.

A growing number of people have died trying to keep warm. In and around the west Texas city of Abilene, authorities said six people died of the cold – including a 60-year-old man found dead in his bed. In the Houston area, a family died from carbon monoxide poisoning as their car idled in their garage.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas used rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. But the remaining Texas outages were mostly weather-related, according to the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Fenton, Fema’s acting director, said on Friday that teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on CBS This Morning, while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

Rotating outages for Texas could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, said Dan Woodfin, the council’s senior director of system operations.

The crisis is exacerbating and demonstrating the chronic inequality in Texas and across the region. In Houston authorities reported that the mass power and water outages led to more than 500 complaints from residents of price gouging costs for water, gas and rent, double the number of grievances lodged at the start of the pandemic, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, a spokeswoman said.

And across Texas’s vast prison network inmates complained of sub-zero temperatures and stagnant, overflowing toilets, according to local reports.

Meanwhile, the Republican senator Ted Cruz continued to face a backlash for traveling to a Mexican resort city in the middle of the crisis. Cruz returned to Texas from his very brief trip to Cancún on Thursday. He has called the trip a “mistake”.

“We’re not spending any time, energy or breath analyzing Senator Cruz’s whereabouts or his group chat,” Psaki said.","Joe Biden said on Friday he was ready to declare a major disaster in Texas after a deadly winter storm cut power and disrupted water supplies for millions across the state.

37,29-Mar-21,Brookings Institution,"In Jackson, Miss., a water crisis has revealed the racial costs of legacy infrastructure","For nearly five weeks beginning in mid-February, parts of Jackson, Miss.—the state’s capital and most populous city—faced a water crisis. Two consecutive storms hit the city and led to prolonged freezing temperatures, causing pipes to burst. Thousands of residents were under a boil-water advisory, which was finally lifted on March 18.

Even before the storms hit, Jackson’s water system was a crisis in the making. “The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped,” said Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba on the structural challenges of paying for deferred infrastructure maintenance and legacy costs. “This is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson…we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state.”

Jackson’s crisis is tied to its inability to proactively invest in infrastructure upgrades. This inability stems from its ongoing economic and fiscal difficulties—a challenge that many other localities and water utilities face. In addition to a declining population, Jackson’s high percentage of low-income residents—in one of the poorest states in the country—limits steady and predictable revenues for public services, including drinking water and wastewater. Simply charging more for these services isn’t easy either, given widespread affordability issues. Mayor Lumumba has attempted to address these issues through new revenue sources—building off efforts of his predecessor and father Chokwe Lumumba, who died in office in 2014—but significant hurdles remain in addressing the estimated $2 billion backlog in needed water repairs.

This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs. Overlooking the impacts of uneven infrastructure on different types of households, especially by race and income, is a big part of that failure.

Jackson is a city with one of the largest shares of Black people in America, in the Blackest state in the union. Ideally, infrastructure serves as a shared foundation for economic, environmental, and public health between different neighborhoods and municipalities; however, infrastructure is often poorly maintained or intentionally overlooked in particular places, leading to a lack of access, affordability, and safety for many communities of color. Forward-looking infrastructure plans and projects designed to reduce risks, manage costs, and provide long-lasting benefits require different jurisdictions to work across economic and racial lines—something Mississippi has historically struggled to do. And since infrastructure is designed to be long-lived, these inequitable systems are also long-lived.

In the case of Jackson, legacy infrastructure goes hand-in-hand with a legacy of racism. The costs of legacy infrastructure parallel long-standing economic and racial disparities in the region. Without steady economic growth and shared economic opportunity—in jobs, wages, and other activity—municipalities and water utilities struggle to predictably and equitably generate enough revenue to cover their infrastructure needs. According to Brookings’s Metro Monitor, the Jackson metro area has only increased jobs by 6.6% and gross metropolitan product by 12.4% from 2009 to 2019—ranking 46th and 44th, respectively, out of the country’s 57 large metro areas with at least 500,000 residents. Over the same period, median wages in Jackson declined by 7.6%, the worst of all large metro areas. And while Jackson is closing the employment gap between people of color and white residents, it still ranks 55th out of 57 when it comes to closing the employment gap between the most advantaged and least advantaged neighborhoods.

Jackson’s water crisis was only the latest in a series of acute and chronic challenges. Past winters have seen broken water mains and business closures, while concerns over water quality, access, and affordability have persisted as well. Last year, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River, in addition to 6 billion gallons of minimally treated sewage. And similar to cities such as Flint, Mich., lead pollution has been a concern. In 2016, Jackson warned citizens to take precautions about lead levels in water, but instead of replacing all pipes—a move that could cost billions of dollars that the city does not have—it moved forward with a lower-cost corrosion control contract. In turn, homeowners are continuing to bear responsibility for lead pipes and other health risks even while some are unable to pay for existing bills; in 2019, the city announced it would turn off water for 20,000 residents in an attempt to collect $45 million in back bills.

As the graphic below shows, water-related expenditures in Jackson have become increasingly untethered to revenues. Because the city has not made long-term and continued investments in its infrastructure, sporadic crises have led to increasingly expensive repairs.

Rising costs and declining revenues—combined with a lack of proactive infrastructure planning and investment in particular neighborhoods of need—have put Jackson in a difficult position. Present and past infrastructure decisions—not only around drinking water and wastewater, but also roadways, mass transit, electricity, and broadband—can lock in structural inequities. Black-majority places such as Jackson, Baltimore, Detroit, and Flint are burdened by both a legacy of infrastructure and racism, setting the stage for future tragedies.

But just as infrastructure can lead to long-lasting costs, it can also be a foundation for long-lasting benefits. Better defining and addressing Jackson’s legacy infrastructure challenges can chart a new path. That requires public and private leaders at the state, regional, and city level—including water utilities—to talk about future and existing infrastructure needs in terms of the most vulnerable households, engage with a greater variety of residents, and test new projects and ideas. For instance, more coordinated “One Water” planning efforts can bridge policy and investment gaps among municipal leaders while involving community-based organizations, workforce development bodies, and other groups that have long been ignored. Better measuring water affordability needs and launching more robust customer assistance programs can make a difference too. And seeking more resilient solutions, including green infrastructure upgrades, can lead to lasting economic and environmental returns.

It looks like President Joe Biden’s next policy priority will be infrastructure. The administration would be wise to acknowledge that simply spending more money is not necessarily the solution. Instead, they should ensure that money is spent to maintain and rebuild the legacy infrastructure that has historically failed Black communities like those in Jackson.","This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs.

Jackson residents are among those in this country who have experienced firsthand the suffering caused when water infrastructure fails.

More than 100 water main breaks recently forced tens of thousands of Jackson residents to go without running water for weeks in February and March – the third collapse of our water infrastructure since 2010.

Last May, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River. Many in our community still rely on lead pipes that pose serious health hazards.

All of these problems require serious investments to fix. But solutions to the gaps in Jackson’s water system require more than stopgap measures; they need sustained and thoughtful investment from all levels of government, the private sector and our residents. The American Jobs Plan may just be what our city has been crying out for, and it’s time we communicate loud and clear about what we need to fix what is broken.

Until now, the city of Jackson and its residents have been forced to tackle the bulk of the estimated $2 billion water infrastructure spending gap we face alone. Even with a proposed one percent sales tax hike to raise revenue for the city’s water and sewer system, we won’t come close to raising the funding we need.

The $47 million that Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called for in a letter to our state and federal representatives would throw us a critical lifeline — but it won’t be a substitute for the overhaul we actually need.

Let’s be clear. Many in our community are struggling to make ends meet, facing expensive water bills while also having to manage the impacts of failing infrastructure. These burdens are an especially pressing threat to the livelihoods of already vulnerable populations and people of color.

If we are serious about investing in infrastructure in Jackson, then we need to start by taking a long and hard look at how we equitably appropriate resources.

Jackson is also not unique. Communities across the country are facing their own structural challenges when it comes to water infrastructure: lead pipes, outdated equipment, lack of resources for backup generators, and a host of other issues keep us from being able to deliver clean and safe water to all of our residents.

Mississippi’s congressional delegation needs to stand up for the residents of Jackson. The Senate recently passed the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, which gives all of us hope. We now need that spirit of bipartisanship and compromise to carry us through.

Our systems are failing us, and without immediate and holistic support from the federal government, they will continue to crumble around us and put lives at risk.

We can’t afford any delay in passing an infrastructure package that is going to deliver the resources necessary to tackle these issues from the ground up, repairing what we can and replacing what we must to make sure that the outages we saw in February never happen again.

39,24-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,Legislative leaders kill key proposal to address Jackson water crisis,"A bill to allow Jackson to raise its citywide sales tax by 1 cent for water and sewer system repairs is dead in the final days of the 2021 legislative session.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, leaving at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — without water for nearly three weeks. City leaders, who have neglected funding the system for decades, say they need major investment from the state and federal government to repair the system, which is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.

The Jackson City Council attempted to take matters into its own hands, passing a proposal in early March to raise the city’s sales tax by 1 cent. That new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — would be used to back large bonds for repairing and replacing the city’s water and sewer system. But state law requires approval from lawmakers before the local sales tax increase could be placed on a citywide ballot. State Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, filed a bill on behalf of the city to acquire legislative sign-off on the 1-cent proposal.

That bill will die without committee consideration, House Local and Private Chairman Manly Barton, R-Moss Point, told Mississippi Today — a blow to the capital city’s main legislative ask as it struggles to afford water system repairs.

Barton said killing the bill is based on precedent — with the 2013 exception of allowing a previous 1-cent sales tax increase for Jackson — of not allowing cities to add on to the state’s sales tax.

“We have been very hesitant to do general sales tax increases for other cities. In fact, we turn them down every year,” Barton said. “We had four or five requests this year. A lot of times the bills don’t even get filed. We work with them on local food-and-beverage, hotel-motel taxes, but there’s just no appetite to do general sales taxes. We’ve been pretty consistent … Of course there was the one for Jackson some years ago — there were conditions set on that and a committee — but we have otherwise been pretty consistent.”

Barton continued: “I think the 1-cent tax would generate about $14 million for Jackson, but it’s a really big hole they’re trying to fill with infrastructure. What I did say is I would do everything I could to help find revenue somewhere else if we possibly can.”

City leaders all along have said the intended purpose of that $14 million a year in new revenue would be to back large bonds, possibly giving the city hundreds of millions they could use in the short-term for infrastructure upgrades.

“This bill, which includes a one percent tax, will support repairing infrastructure after decades of neglect,” Bell told Mississippi Today. “We’ll still need additional support, but this is a first step at a time of urgent need. Sadly, our plan hasn’t been accepted by those in leadership, which further makes our road to recovery difficult.”

Earlier this month in private meetings with both House Speaker Philip Gunn and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba asked for support of Bell’s bill. The 1-cent sales tax increase was the mayor’s main ask of the Republican leaders, along with state bonds that could help the city make emergency repairs on its water distribution system.

Local and private legislation like Bell’s bill traditionally requires support from all or most lawmakers of the locality in question — an unwritten but decades long-standing rule inside the Capitol. In this case, not all of Jackson’s House and Senate delegates were on board with the measure.

After his meeting with Lumumba, Gunn publicly expressed concern about allowing Jackson to raise its sales tax, prompting questions about whether Bell’s bill ever stood a chance of passing out of the House chamber.

“It creates a precedent, if you will, that may be a dangerous area to go to as far as other cities around the state wanting to do the same thing,” Gunn told Scott Simmons at WAPT earlier this month. “And we may get in a situation where the tax burden (on Jackson residents) is just too great.”

Even had the bill passed the House, it faced a difficult road in the Senate. Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, met privately on March 12 with four of the five state senators representing the city of Jackson. None of those senators — Democratic Sens. Sollie Norwood, Hillman Frazier, John Horhn and David Blount — told the lieutenant governor they supported the sales tax increase, according to several of the meeting’s attendees. Sen. Walter Michel, R-Ridgeland, could not attend the meeting but is said to oppose the sales tax increase.

“I am not in favor of (the 1-cent increase),” Horhn told Mississippi Today. “I think it will place too much of a burden on the city’s taxpayers. I believe it inhibits businesses from coming into the city. And it also hurts the efforts to retain and to expand businesses already here.”

Norwood told Mississippi Today he was “open-minded,” but that many of his constituents “have expressed disdain for (the sales tax increase), but I am still not done surveying it.”

Frazier told Mississippi Today he was still studying the possibility of the sales tax increase, “but I have not heard many positive comments about it from the folks in my district. They say it is regressive, and they already are paying an extra 1 cent for infrastructure.”

When asked if he supported the sales tax increase, Blount would not commit. “We are discussing all options, state and federal sources,” he said.

In another indication that the senators opposed the proposal: No one filed a Senate bill similar to Bell’s House bill that would garner legislative approval of the tax increase.

Lawmakers are working to end the current legislative session soon after this coming weekend, and it is unclear what funds, if any, they will appropriate to the city of Jackson. Republican leaders have remained tight-lipped as they are in closed-door meetings this week hammering out the state’s general fund budget.

The closing days of any legislative session are usually when lawmakers pass large packages that send state bonds to local governments. Neither Hosemann nor Gunn have publicly said they wouldn’t support a modest bond package for Jackson, and every lawmaker representing the city of Jackson in both the House and Senate support that effort.

The city announced additional distribution sites for water in an update on the city's water water shortage that has now stretched into an eighth day.

Officials say a majority of the city will see their water restored by the end of the week, but cautioned that could be delayed by water main breaks.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil-water notice.

Updated distribution sites

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Wednesday.

It has purchased 45 pallets of bottled water and is continuing efforts to source more.

City officials said bottled water will be distributed at VA Field, located at 4400 Ofc. Thomas Catchings Drive, beginning at 3 p.m. Wednesday. The location will continue providing water to residents until supplies are exhausted.

Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said more distribution sites could come in the near future and city leaders will notify residents when water is available.

In a tweet Tuesday, Gov. Tate Reeves said the state has acquired more tanker trucks of non-potable water to be delivered to the city. In addition, resources from the Mississippi National Guard have also been deployed in Jackson to assist residents.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through Friday:

Jackson water crisis: Local experts give tips on how to prepare for future water outages in Jackson

Garbage pickup

Waste Management has resumed regularly scheduled collection services, but is experiencing high volumes of garbage and trash along all routes, which may cause some delays in service. Any routes not completed on schedule will become first priority the next morning, the mayor's office said.

Waste Management said it anticipates all routes, including residential, commercial and roll-off, to be recovered by the end of the week.

The city is asking residents to only place household garbage out for both collection days this week in an effort to prevent heavy loads. It asks for residents to hold bulk items and yard debris for next week.

Waste Management will begin removing tree limbs and debris beginning next week.

Residents are asked to call the city's solid waste department at 601-960-1193 for more information.

Numbers to call

The city says it is still overwhelmed by calls to 311. It advises residents to reserve calls to the city hotline for water main breaks.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

41,27-Feb-21,The Daily Beast,Frustrated Jackson Locals Are Nearing Two Weeks With No Water,"For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

For professional chef Enrika Williams, who lives in south Jackson with four other family members, it was a scramble when news began circulating around Valentine’s Day of an unexpected cold front where temperatures dropped into the teens.

Worried her pipes might freeze, quick-thinking Williams filled up her bathtub in case of such an event. Unfortunately for her and thousands of others, the unseasonably frigid weather caused the city’s outdated water equipment­–which can’t handle wintery conditions–to freeze and water lines to burst.

The result was dire, leading the city to issue a boil-water advisory and set up distribution sites for flushing water and bottled drinking water, with hundreds waiting in line with empty buckets for hours.

Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home. She bought water wherever she could, shelling out $100 on bottled water to cook and clean with.

Nearby family members who happened to have water opened up their home so Williams, her mother, two siblings, and niece could wash their clothes and take a shower.

For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

While Williams finally has water again, albeit trickling, she voiced her dissatisfaction with the city’s everchanging timeframe of when the water would be running again.

“The thing that became frustrating was the tone of accountability just wasn’t there,” Williams told The Daily Beast. “There was no plan that we could see. The press conferences were redundant. If you don’t know when it’s coming back, what is being done to help us?”

“There wasn’t anyone at the forefront who gave a damn, so to speak,” she added. “It makes you feel a lot of things. You just expect better.”

In Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new. Six years ago the city approved a 1 percent sales tax increase with the goal of updating all of its aging infrastructure, but the $15 million it generates annually is only a fraction of the $2 billion Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the city will need. Long before the current crisis hit, one popular local t-shirt read “Welcome to Boil Water Alert, Mississippi.”

What’s different this time, residents say, is the sheer scale—the entire city is either without water or under a boil water alert.

“ It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives. ” — Laurie Bertram Roberts

More than a few residents have noted that the crisis has hit south and west Jackson hardest while leaving northeast Jackson, the one predominantly white corner of this 80 percent Black capital city, relatively unscathed. Over the past several days, Laurie Bertram Roberts, who runs the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, has used the fund to distribute more than 130 cases of water to residents, with plans to deliver another 80 tomorrow.

“Part of the problem is that it’s everywhere,” Roberts said. “Usually when we have an outage it’s in one neighborhood, so people are used to running over to their friends’ house or their auntie’s house to take a shower or fill up some jugs. Usually, you can grab your buckets and find some place to fill them, whatever. But when it’s the whole damn city? Where are the Black people supposed to go? It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives.”

Jackson, which has a population of around 160,000, has a 26.9 percent poverty rate. Williams explained that a lot of people don’t have the resources to go out and buy additional water to cook and bathe with.

“People can’t afford that,” she said. “Water is a basic necessity and it just brought a lot of frustration, anger, and disappointment.”

“We aren’t out of the woods yet. There’s still a lot of people without water.”

While Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday night that he would “restore clean water” and send in the National Guard and tanker trucks with non-potable water in effort to relieve the issue, conditions still hadn’t improved by Saturday.

Fed-up locals flooded the city’s Facebook page to demand answers.

“Day 12 and not even a drip at my house,” Dwight Pugh wrote. “NEVER have we had disrupted this long.”

“It’s clear that the city government doesn’t have the resources or the ability to manage things, and they’re getting worse, rather than better,” John Zer added.

“It’s been two weeks and I know families with infants who don’t have water. The city needs help,” Jamario Townsend chimed in. “I’m thankful my water is trickling out enough to flush my toilet but dang. This just needs to be fixed at this point. It just needs to be fixed.”

Many directed their anger towards Democratic Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who had pleaded with his constituents to have “patience” while admitting there was “no definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.”

“ This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents. ” — Mayor Chokwe Lumumba

Accused of being too slow to reach out to Reeves for assistance, Lumumba claimed the Republican governor wouldn’t return any of his phone calls. Reeves’ camp quickly fired back that the governor had no missed calls from Lumumba.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, “The challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different. This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents.”

“Our systems were never meant to endure days of ice storms and sub-zero temperatures coupled by road conditions that prevented the delivery of critical supplies,” he added. “It has been a difficult few weeks. Our recovery efforts continue. We are not there yet, but we are doing everything we can to restore water to Jackson residents.”

Reeves seems to agree, saying earlier in the week that Jackson’s water systems problems date back to “50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.”

“That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we’re going to fix in the next six to eight hours,” he added.","For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

42,31-Mar-21,Politico,How a ‘Radical’ Southern Mayor Ran Up Against Reality,"When it comes to Jackson’s roads, Lumumba has had limited success as well. He has estimated that it would cost $2 billion just to replace the city’s torn-up roads and fix its century-old water pipes and sewers. But Jackson’s tax base has been declining for years. Meanwhile, state lawmakers killed a local 1 percent sales tax to fix Jackson’s infrastructure, even though the city council approved the tax and Lumumba has been lobbying state leaders for it; the Mississippi legislature is required to approve such tax increases in the state. A federal infrastructure bill would help, of course, but Lumumba has no control of that.

“Making sustainable models work in municipal government is the bedrock of the movement,” says Larry Cohen, chairman of the Bernie Sanders-affiliated progressive group Our Revolution, which endorsed Lumumba the first time he ran and continues to support him. “The concern is where do you get investment? … Otherwise it becomes an almost impossible challenge.”

Mississippi’s Republican Gov. Tate Reeves says he and Lumumba have a good working relationship. But Reeves says the state already invests plenty in Jackson, and that it’s up to the city to better manage its finances. “We want to be helpful. We want to do our part,” Reeves said in an interview at the governor’s mansion. He also said the city should fix its water billing issues before raising taxes: “They understand now that they have to get that fixed long before the request of asking other taxpayers throughout the state or other taxpayers throughout the nation to bail out the Jackson water system.”

Many in Jackson’s Democratic leadership have been frustrated not just by Lumumba’s vision, but by his youth, his brashness, his attitude, his confidence (or arrogance, depending whom you ask), his attempts to circumvent them, his casting them aside.

Last year, for example, Democratic presidential hopefuls sought out Lumumba as a key endorsement in the 2020 primary. In February, Lumumba held what he called a “people’s caucus,” where representatives from various campaigns spoke in Jackson, and attendees voted on the candidates. The 100 or so attendees, according to Mississippi Today, overwhelmingly voted for Sanders. Days later, Lumumba endorsed the Vermont senator. While it might have looked like Lumumba was channeling the views of his constituents, the residents of Hinds County, which includes Jackson, ended up voting overwhelming for Joe Biden in the primary. Democratic lawmakers in Jackson and in other Southern cities — like Birmingham's Randall Woodfin, who also was supported by Our Revolution — endorsed Biden, too.

The process showed that Lumumba is out of step with Jackson, says city councilperson and pastor Aaron Banks, who served as the elder Lumumba’s constituent services representative. “When it comes to a far-left approach, I don’t think that’s the best way for the city of Jackson,” says Banks, pointing out that Mississippi is still a very Republican state. “If the city is going to thrive and have success, we have to find that road in the middle.”

Lumumba pushes back, pointing out that the Mississippi primary took place a week after Super Tuesday, by which point Biden’s win was all but certain. He also stands by the process, which he said gave residents a chance to hear candidates’ platforms.

Lumumba has also earned the ire of many local Black contractors, a group of powerful enemies. Marcus Wallace, who is mayor of Edwards, a small town west of Jackson, owns a construction company that has done business with previous mayors. A few years ago, Wallace invested $200,000 in equipment to fix potholes in Jackson, but he told me he hasn’t gotten any business from the current mayor. Driving around downtown Jackson on a Saturday morning, Wallace pointed out potholes and cracked city streets that Lumumba hadn’t gotten around to fixing. He argues that Lumumba has focused on fixing highly visible streets but has neglected those where poor Black residents live.

“This administration does a lot of grandstanding,” Wallace says.

He told me he and other local construction business owners tried to recruit more candidates to jump into the mayor’s race, but few were interested in challenging Lumumba.","When it comes to Jackson’s roads, Lumumba has had limited success as well.

43,1-May-21,WLBT,"Wicker, Hyde-Smith back bill that could provide Jackson with millions to restore water system","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Mississippi Sens. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Roger Wicker were among the 89 members of the U.S. Senate who voted in favor of a bill that would reauthorize a series of federal water and wastewater infrastructure programs that could benefit the capital city.

On April 29, the Senate approved S.914, the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act of 2021.

The bill was approved on an 89-2 vote and was passed a day before Jackson experienced yet another crisis at its O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

Early Friday, an electrical fire broke out at the Ridgeland facility shutting down two high-service pumps. The fire took place in one control panel, but as a precaution, officials shut down the entire system and issued a boil water notice because of the loss in pressure.

Pressure across the system dropped as a result, and some 43,000 customers were again put under a precautionary boil water notice.

The fire represents the second time operations at the plant have been hampered this year. In February, the plant was crippled when two winter storms ripped across the area, causing equipment at the plant to freeze up. It took weeks for the city to restore water to all residents and businesses following that storm.

S.914 would allocate some $30 billion in funding for clean water and drinking water revolving loan funds and an additional $6 billion for grant programs, according to NBC News.

The bill also would also ease restrictions for cities borrowing money and would allow for more of the debt to be forgiven, according to WaterWorld magazine.

Over the years, Jackson has issued millions in state revolving loan funds to cover water and sewer needs. The loans are made available through the Mississippi State Health Department and Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality and come with lower interest rates than commercial bonds.

The measure now must go to the House of Representatives for consideration.

44,25-Feb-21,Christian Science Monitor,Water problems across the South: Blame it on decades-old pipes,"The sunshine is back and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their citizens.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region's water mains, froze equipment, and left millions without service, it’s clear just how much work needs to be done.

Families stood for hours in lines to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

“You don’t realize how much you use water until you don’t have it,” said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described “chronic, long-term and insufficient investment.” The report warned that the “nation’s public health and the economy will be at risk.""

Actually, it's already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents in the city of 650,000 have been told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they plan to use it for drinking, cooking, or brushing their teeth. More than 40,000 Louisianans still had water outages Wednesday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are “non-operational,” affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation's fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already-struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi’s majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson’s water problem a public health crisis.

“The wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,” the retired public works department employee said. “It’s not their concern because they don’t live here no more.”

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

“These pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,” he said. “They’ll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they’ll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.”

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets, and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, while collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

“The vulnerable are left behind,” she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to “old, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.”

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins’ bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants was being done, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city’s 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.

In Jackson, Mississippi, thousands of residents have gone weeks without water. It is a crisis caused by systemic injustices, crumbling water infrastructure, and the climate chaos that brought unprecedented freezing temperatures throughout the South in February.

At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

More than 100 water mains burst in Jackson, leaving residents without water for bathing and cooking. Emergency bottled water was distributed across the city for drinking, and some residents have also gathered and used melted snow and rainwater.

This should not be happening in the United States, one of the wealthiest countries in the world. And while the water woes being experienced by residents of Jackson are more acute than in other places struck by the recent freezing Southern weather, communities throughout the South have experienced widespread water main breaks and failures, largely driven by an aging infrastructure.

Recent years have seen a spate of severe water crises—in Flint, Michigan, rural California, and Martin County, Kentucky, to name a few. Nationally, millions of people lack access to clean, reliable water. Our water infrastructure is crumbling and fiscal austerity is at the core of the problem.

Each year, more than 240,000 water main breaks occur, wasting more than two trillion gallons of drinking water. For decades, federal funding for water infrastructure has been declining. It peaked in 1977, and since then spending has been cut by 77 percent (based on real dollars as of 2017).

This dramatic cut in federal support has increased the burden on state and local communities, which have struggled to keep up. In cities like Jackson that have experienced a declining tax base, the problem has been dire. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba estimated it would cost $2 billion to bring his city’s water system up to date. The city’s total annual budget is only around $300 million.

The inability of cities to replace aging pipes is just one part of our national water crisis. We also have an aging wastewater system, rampant lead contamination, a separate and lurking rural water crisis, and significant water needs in Indigenous communities.

Unsurprisingly, the hardest impacted communities are largely communities of color. Jackson’s population, for example, is more than 80 percent Black. Study after study has found that Black and Indigenous communities disproportionately lack access to safe water in the United States.

This daunting crisis requires a bold federal response. As President Joe Biden and Congressional leaders assemble a much-hyped infrastructure package, they must prioritize funding for our aging water systems.

A blueprint for what this funding should look like is the Water Affordability, Transparency, Equity and Reliability (WATER) Act, recently introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and Representatives Brenda Lawrence and Ro Khanna in the House.

The WATER Act would provide $35 billion a year to restore and renew our aging water infrastructure, including targeted provisions to help hard-hit areas like low-income communities, rural water systems, and Indigenous communities. It includes grants to schools and homeowners to replace lead pipes and service lines, and it would help make our water systems climate resilient—something for which the current crisis in Jackson has starkly demonstrated the urgent need.

President Joe Biden has said he intends to introduce an infrastructure package in the coming weeks to help the economy recover from the COVID-19-induced recession. Investing in water infrastructure would certainly help do that, and spending proposals laid out in the WATER Act could create nearly one million jobs across the economy. The bill’s requirement that the infrastructure be built with U.S.-made iron and steel, along with prevailing wage requirements, would further help workers and the economy.

At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

Our nation is facing multiple crises—the pandemic, an economic downturn, a climate crisis, and a water crisis. President Biden has an opportunity to lead the nation through all of these. To do so, however, requires real leadership and a comprehensive agenda.

In fighting for significant funding for public water infrastructure, Biden and Congress can help ensure that millions of people in the United States have reliable access to clean public water, while simultaneously revitalizing the economy and building climate resilience for our collective future.","At a time when large corporate interests are increasingly exercising control over society, the WATER Act limits water funding to publicly run systems and small, locally run entities, ensuring that federal dollars go to public benefit—not to profiteering water corporations.

48,30-Mar-21,WJTV,Jackson leaders look for long term fix to prevent another water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Lawmakers slashed the amount of money the City of Jackson asked for to replace the city’s aging water system. But other routes for financial help are still open.

Jackson public works Director Dr. Charles Williams told me he has detailed plans on how to build back and replace the city water plants and its distribution system. He’s confident the funding will become available.

The city asked lawmakers for $47 million to address “immediate needs”. Lawmakers agreed to give $3 million for the project.

“If we were able to utilize $3 million then obviously that would assist us to upgrade the system at the treatment facilities,” Dr. Williams explained. “But also, an opportunity to maybe do an investment within the distribution system itself.”

Jackson state Representatives and Senators are optimistic $6 billion from the American Rescue Plan coming to Mississippi can be broken up to help fund permanent repairs. This on top of $47 million from Mississippi U.S Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.

“We’re hoping that the United State’s Senator will come through and help the City of Jackson,” Councilman Kenneth Stokes of Ward three said Tuesday. “To help us in our water crisis. A sincere effort would be a new water plant.”

For Public Works Director Dr. Williams the priorities will be to get the plants weatherized and install larger distribution lines that will allow water to flow strongly into South Jackson.

“The plant itself needs equipment to properly operate,” Dr. Williams said. “It needs staffing so you need an annual budget that can provide funding in place to keep those mechanical and electrical systems operating.”

In its current status, Dr. Williams emphasized Jackson’s water treatment system is still vulnerable and could crash again if major repairs do not begin by next winter.

Going forward all eyes will be on how Mississippi legislators distribute the American Rescue Plan funds allocated to the state and when, and if, groundbreaking begins on these projects. The price tag for a complete fix of Jackson’s water system is estimated to be over $1 billion.

The city requested $47 million in state money. According to Mississippi Today, only $3 million dollars is being earmarked for Jackson. The funds would go to the city’s oldest water treatment plant.

Stainless steel pots, a faded-orange wheelbarrow and a 5-gallon container sitting on Barbara Howard’s back porch brim with rainwater. She’s strategically placed them under the roof, letting the light Monday rain gather and then fall into the vessels more effectively.

She grabs a stock pot by its handles and pours it into a nearby trashcan. From there, she’ll scoop out water with a sauce pot to fill her toilet.

A gallon-and-a-half is needed for a single flush. Her Sunday night and Monday collection are enough to last her for the next two days. For Howard, slugging water back and forth from distribution sites is more time-consuming than her newest method.

Inside her South Jackson home, gallons of distilled water and plastic water bottles line her kitchen counters. It’s for teeth-brushing and for handwashing. More for the few dishes she allows herself to use. She doesn’t dare cook, because dirtying dishes means using more water.

“It’s a challenge,” the Jackson State University professor repeats calmly. “But imagine these routines with little bitty ones or the elderly.”

She’s spent nearly two weeks collecting and distributing water. Living without power for four days. Two hotel stays for a cleansing shower. Her faucets ran dry nearly two weeks ago. They still haven’t sputtered back to life. And she isn’t alone.

About 65% of residents in Ward 6 have no water

While water distribution sites lace the city, and restoration has increased since the winter storm glazed Jackson’s infrastructure with ice, South Jackson remains a pocket of residents who are thrusting buckets outside to collect the drizzle. It was only Saturday that some saw a low-pressure stream lurch from their faucets.

About 65% of Ward Six residents have no water, Councilperson Aaron Banks estimated Monday afternoon. It’s not unusual for South Jackson — the location farthest from the treatment plant on the reservoir — to have their water restored last.

He knows it firsthand.

As the steady stream of residents pop their trunks open at Forest Hill High School, Banks loads their cars with a 45-pack of water bottles and a gallon of distilled water. He nods toward the two water tankers in the lot, “When we started out here with these tankers, snow was still on the ground.”

Along with a handful of volunteers, Banks has worked through icy temperatures and pelting rain to help South Jackson residents. Monday is no different. Within 20 minutes, a dozen cars pull up.

“I need to pick up for my elderly neighbor,” several people muffle through face masks.

South Jackson is filled with elderly residents and retirees, many of whom have struggled to make it to the water sites and cannot secure gallons of water in their vehicles as they brace the bumpy roads.

SUBSCRIBERS: 'We're just not built for this down here': Jackson water crisis is latest chapter in decades-long saga

Monday afternoon, Rita Johnson was in the line at Forest Hill. She was picking up water for her family and asked for more to deliver to her elderly neighbors.

Johnson’s a mother of three and a nursing student. And, like Howard, she’s been without water for days.

She uses water bottles from the Forest Hill site to cook, and she bounces between friends’ homes for showering. But the water Johnson said she gets from the distribution site isn’t enough. It’s further complicated her already-busy life, but she’s still finding ways to help vulnerable South Jackson residents.

“If this was your parent, you wouldn’t want them to go out,” she said. “We need to try and help each other.”

Brookleigh Neighborhood Association lends a helping hand

There’s no exact timeline for total restoration. No definite date to lift the citywide water boil advisory. But what is clear is the helping hand from the Brookleigh Homeowner and Neighborhood Association for South Jackson residents.

Emon Thompson has lived in Mississippi for the past 30 years, and he’s been the association’s president for almost four. He’s experienced area flooding and water main breaks that have been slow to fix, but he can’t recall a time there wasn’t water to flush a toilet.

Even now, as some Brookleigh resident’s water trickles from the faucet, it can take toilets minutes to refill.

He and his wife Cynthia Thompson, who coordinates the association's social media, noticed South Jackson’s need for support immediately. The neighborhood, about 450 homes dense, is chock-full of retirees and then there's working-class people, many who work jobs stretching before and beyond the hours water distribution sites offer.

The couple has gone door-to-door providing water and worked a distribution site, alongside Banks, Saturday at Griffith Memorial Baptist Church. They've even scooped water from their swimming pool to deliver.

“It could’ve been worse, but it could’ve been better,” Emon Thompson said.

But it isn’t over.

Although water began flowing into some Brookleigh homes, low-pressure causes comes with a host of problems. People can’t get enough water to wash their clothes, safely cook or do stacks of dishes. Monday, Banks urged businesses that rely on substantial amounts of water, such as car washes, to close their doors until water pressure builds back up to normal.

And same for people with running water. Conserve it, Banks said.

Looking forward, he’s narrowing in on mitigation. South Jackson makes up four wards; 4, 5, 6 and 7, and often times, he said, residents feel left behind.

Jackson water crisis: Crews still working to restore pressure, fix water main breaks

“We kind of feel like we’re the stepchild of Jackson, however, that’s not true but it’s the feeling,” Banks said.

The Thompsons, Banks, Johnson and Howard are wading through uncertainties about when water will fully be restored, but for now, they are sure to do two things: Check on neighbors and deliver water to those most vulnerable.

Help doesn’t have to look as large-scale as the Thompsons fielding resident calls and going door-to-door, or tanker trucks cruising through a neighborhood. It can be systematic, like Howards rainwater collection. Or grabbing an extra case of water bottles for a neighbor, like Johnson.

“I appreciate the tanks. I appreciate the bottled water. But I rather have the pipes fixed,” Howard said. “It’s one thing to put a Band-Aid on the problem and it’s one thing to fix it. A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough.”","'A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough': Many South Jackson residents still have no running waterShow Caption Hide Caption Jackson, Miss., water maintenance crews work to get water mains fixed City of Jackson Water Maintenance Department crews are out in force fixing broken water mains to help get the city's water flowing.

For the past month, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi simply haven’t had water: not safe water, not reliable water. After winter storms knocked out electricity there, as they did throughout the South, the damage also wreaked havoc on Jackson’s brittle water system. Each issue is connected to the other: the aging pipes that need to be replaced, the lead that can seep into the water when the pipes burst, the condition of the water treatment plants. The faucets are back on in Jackson for now, but the pipes aren’t going to hold up much longer. On Tuesday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Nick Judin, a reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, about how Jackson became a city without water, and how it could happen again, all too soon. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Last week, the city’s boil-water order was lifted. Do you feel like the crisis is over?

Nick Judin: The underlying problems behind the crisis have not even begun to be solved. Please don’t look away now, because a permanent solution has to be found, and we haven’t even begun that yet.

The crisis is really a chain reaction that gives us a map of the water infrastructure problems that the city has. In the middle of February comes these two severe freezes, the kind the state is completely unused to. Water comes in from a reservoir northeast of the city that then hits these water screens at the water treatment plants. It’s so cold that it can’t get through the screens that freeze.

It’s ice.

It’s ice. Now, what happens then is the basin that is supplying the city’s pipes with water runs low and the pressure in the system drops. People no longer have water. That’s just the beginning of the problem. That’s why no one had water at the beginning. The problem is, once that system loses pressure and everyone loses water, you have miles of pipes in the system that are over 100 years old. So after they freeze, the act of refilling them is absolutely destructive to these pipes. We had more than 100 water main breaks at the final count over the month.

When you went outside, did you see cones everywhere?

You see breaks in the street. You see water running out. You see work crews everywhere, and you don’t see any water coming out of your faucet. It was this process of slowly refilling, slowly pushing the pressure back up and then repairing every main break. That’s why it took a month.

To get to the root of Jackson’s current crisis, you have to go back more than 50 years and talk about how the city itself has changed. Because this water problem can’t be disentangled from larger changes in the state of Mississippi: the desegregation of schools, white flight.

In 1969, the clock finally runs out on the state of Mississippi segregated school system, with Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education. The 1970 school year in Mississippi was like a lightning bolt. You could just see kids being pulled out of school, and the creation of a lot of segregation academies, many of which are still relatively well-regarded schools in Mississippi today. By the time the dust settles in 1980, Jackson never sees population growth ever again. At its height, I think the city had a little bit more than 200,000 people. Today, the best estimate for that is 160,000.

What does that have to do with the water?

You build a water infrastructure for the people you have at the time. What ends up happening is you build that system and then you have white flight, you have capital flight, you have the suburbanization of many of the metropolitan areas around the country. Then that tax base now lives outside the city limits.

And there’s no commuter tax or bridge and tunnel fare.

To my knowledge, there is not nearly enough support coming from the cities and towns around Jackson to support its burden.

You’re saying Jackson built its system to meet this larger population, which to me says, they must have a really robust system with fewer people using it. How did that become a problem for the city?

Advertisement

In 1972, there was a serious amendment to the Clean Water Act that put the burden of responsibility for a lot of wastewater treatment in the municipalities around the United States on the core of these metropolitan areas. A huge, huge amount of this construction was supported with federal grants. By 1987, in our era of austerity and federal pullback, there’s a transition. We stop paying for a lot of these systems with federal money and it devolves to what’s called the state revolving loan funds. Now, you may notice the problem with that. The issue with the loan is that it’s loan. So when you see an end to the federal money that supports a lot of these systems, there’s then a system that’s made for a certain population and that population is no longer there. That becomes a real problem for any city looking to keep its system afloat.

Because you’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need.

You’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need and you no longer have the federal support that made it possible in the first place.

You’ve said Gov. Tate Reeves has been uniquely resistant to addressing the crisis in Mississippi’s waters. Do you think he doesn’t necessarily feel like he needs to fix this problem?

There doesn’t seem to be any direct communication between the governor and the mayor. I’m not really sure how something like that happens if the governor really, really wants to fix the problem.

You spoke to a representative from Jackson who worried that federal involvement actually might not help the state, because it might mean that state legislators feel like they are off the hook and don’t need to step in and help the city.

Advertisement

Well, let me be very clear: Federal involvement will absolutely help the state. I don’t think there’s any situation in which the state gets out of this problem without federal assistance. I don’t think that should be surprising, because, if you want to go and look back at the last time the city really had a working water system, there was immense federal aid coming in to the Public Works Department to make the entire system whole. So when you want to talk about how to get out of this situation, you need improvement at the level of the city, you need investment at the level of the state, and then you need involvement at the federal level. I don’t think any one of those pieces can be missing. I think his concern is not that federal help might not help, but that, with federal engagement, the state will kind of bow out of the whole situation. The state has to address the relationship it has with its capital city. It’s incredibly cheap and easy for representatives and senators who don’t live in the urban areas of the state to complain about Jackson.

53,17-Mar-21,Democracy Now!,"Jackson Mayor Demands Help After Month-Long Water Crisis Amid Pandemic, Racism, Broken Infrastructure","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month. On the pandemic front, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to open up vaccine eligibility to all residents over age 16. Twenty percent of adults in Mississippi has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Public health experts are urging residents to keep wearing masks, even though the state’s Republican governor has lifted the statewide mask mandate, and to regularly wash their hands — something that’s been hard to do for the past month in Jackson, the state’s capital, which has gone five weeks without safe drinking water.

The deadly February winter storm that left most of Texas without power for days also devastated other Southern states. In Jackson, the freezing temperatures burst pipes and water mains, leaving most of Jackson without reliable access to running water. While water delivery has largely been restored, “boil water” orders remain in effect for most residents.

The crisis highlights how climate change threatens much of the nation’s aging infrastructure. For Jackson, there are no easy solutions. The city estimates it could cost $2 billion to fix the city’s water system, but Jackson is a poor city in the poorest state in the country. The city is 82% Black, while the state Legislature is majority white. White politicians have openly suggested Jackson’s problems are because of its Black leadership. Mississippi’s Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann criticized Jackson’s handling of the crisis by saying, quote, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?” Kane Ditto was Jackson’s last white mayor.

Donna Ladd of the Jackson Free Press recently wrote, quote, “Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers.”

We go now to Jackson, Mississippi, where we’re joined by Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. He has served as mayor since 2017. His father, Chokwe Lumumba, also briefly served as mayor before dying unexpectedly in 2014 eight months into his first term.

Mayor, it’s great to have you back on Democracy Now! Your city is facing a massive crisis — two. Of course, you’re dealing, like the whole country, with the coronavirus pandemic. And at the same time, you haven’t had clean drinking water for a month. Can you explain what’s happening and what needs to be done?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Yes. First, Amy, thank you for having me again, and thank you for lifting up this issue.

What we suffered after the two winter storms — and I need to make certain that I clarify that, that we had two consecutive storms that took place, leaving us in prolonged low temperatures in the city of Jackson, historically low temperatures in the city of Jackson. And what it did was it created complications getting water into our treatment facility. The raw water screens are at the inception point of the water treatment facility, in which they froze. And because we couldn’t get water in, it complicated or made it impossible for us to clean water and get water out, leaving our distribution system compromised. And as consumption was high, it drained many of the tanks across the city. And our PSI — our water treatment facility operates off of hydraulics. The PSI went down to 37. We need our PSI at about 90 in order to distribute water throughout the system.

This is on account of an aged, aging infrastructure of a legacy city, money which has not been contributed over time, while the city of Jackson contributes millions of dollars each and every year, and has done so since Kane Ditto, before Kane Ditto, and continues to do so. What we have not is had a state leadership that identifies this as not just a city of Jackson problem, but a ongoing and shared problem of not only the city, but the state. And I’d like to just emphasize that in a few ways, if I could, Amy.

One, the city of Jackson is the largest city by a factor of three, the highest contributor to revenue to the state. We are the state capital, which means that many of our properties are untaxable. We do not get payment in lieu of taxes. Furthermore, we provide water to state facilities at no cost to the state of Mississippi. So, if they just paid their water bill, the city of Jackson would be in a lot better position.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mayor, I wanted to ask you — for the brief time that your father was in office, one of the things that he was praised for was attempting to address the infrastructure problem. As I recall, he tried to institute a new tax to provide better infrastructure services. What’s been the problem between the — you mentioned one aspect, the state not paying its water bill — but in terms of being able to implement upgrades of the system?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, I think that you would have to understand the comprehensive infrastructure problem in the city of Jackson. The 1% sales tax generates about $13 million annually. And when I said $2 billion, I didn’t say $2 billion for the water system; I said comprehensively. The way we know that is that the EPA has estimated that our wastewater problem is about a billion dollars, where sewage is coming up in people’s yards and in their backyards and in ditches, and those issues. So, that’s one. That’s before we get to the drinking water, which we see the crisis that we have on our hands after the February storms. That doesn’t get to the drainage. We suffered a 30-year flood just recently, this past — in 2020. So, that doesn’t get to the issue of how drainage is — how people address that. And that doesn’t get to roads and bridges and all of these things, all these parts of our infrastructure that our residents rely on. So, $13 million is just insufficient to meet the need.

The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped. And so, this is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson. Not only are we not met with a consistent plan in order to support the city that supports the state of Mississippi; we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state. But also, we’ve had resources stripped away from us. You referenced the conversation, or you referenced the statements of Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann. As we have lifted up these issues year after year in our legislative agenda, understanding that it’s not a matter of if these infrastructure systems will fail, but when, he redirected the conversation to talk about the state’s effort to take over the city of Jackson’s airport, which is a profitable institution that we rely on year after year.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how difficult has it been for the residents of your city to deal with the water situation while at the same time contending with the issues around the COVID pandemic?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, as you can imagine, our residents have made every endeavor to be as patient as they could. But the frustrations are high. You know, as you can imagine, when people want to drink water, cook with water, not only bathe but get rid of waste, people being concerned about not only the safety precautions of the pandemic but also taking medications, simple things like that, that they anticipate that water will help serve the need to do those things, it has been extremely difficult.

And so, you know, I do want to lift up the many people across the city, individuals, businesses, people from around the country, who have stood in the gap, rallied around the city of Jackson to distribute water. Each one of us have spent countless hours out making certain that we got water to the elderly, to the immobile, to the disabled. And so, while there has been great frustration around these issues, these are issues that the residents of Jackson have dealt with for quite some time, and so they’re very familiar, they’re intimately familiar, with the history of divestment, the history of a lack of investment from the state, very familiar with the woes and troubles of our water infrastructure and our infrastructure in a comprehensive way, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Calandra Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute. She has been delivering bottled water and food to those without water supply.

CALANDRA DAVIS: The communities that was hardest hit by this water crisis are in South and West Jackson, which, again, are the predominantly or majority Black and Brown communities in the city. So, again, it just shows that it wasn’t just another bad weather day for us, that this has been, again, years of neglect to the majority Black and Brown parts of the city, also just another example of how structural racism works.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you explain how people are getting water? I mean, if people can’t afford to buy water, how do they get to places where water is, or have to go to pick it up? One older woman described the only thing she could get was little bottled water. This is to keep themselves clean. It’s not just for drinking.

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, you know, along with the complication of a water treatment facility essentially crashing during the storm, we also had the challenge for several days because roads were iced over and the transportation or distribution system was interrupted on our highways. And so, it became complicated because the local stores didn’t have water anymore. It became complicated because — it was increasingly challenging because trucks could not come and deliver water. But we were able to manage through that and set up distribution sites across the city. The state National Guard did set up tanks around the city for non-potable water, for people to come with containers and utilize. As I mentioned, you had several businesses, several individuals, that stood in the gap in order to support people in that way.

I do want to lift up the issue that Ms. Davis spoke to: the equity issues. You know, it is not a system where you turn on water from one area of town or another area of town. The system distributes water through the lines that were laid, actually, more than a hundred years ago. The problem is an issue of equity. We just have to understand when the take took place. The take happened, or the issues of people who are in poverty or don’t have the resources not being able to get the water, is because they live in areas that were not valued as high or as more desirable by those who had money. Those who had money built homes near — closest to the resources, closer to the water treatment facilities. Therefore, when water is redistributed through the distribution system, through the lines, they are the ones who get water sooner. When you get to South and West Jackson, those are the areas furthest away from the plant. Those are the areas at higher elevations across the city, which means that the water not only has to travel far, but it has to travel high. It has to go up those high elevation points.

And so, you know, we must lift up not only how we build sustainable infrastructure, but how we do it in an equitable way, looking at these issues and looking at how we address those areas through city planning. And city planning is never neutral. City planning is not by mistake. We have to be able to make sure that we do this in a way that creates dignity for all residents across our city.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mayor, on this issue of equitable distribution of resources and services, years ago, your father pioneered the Jackson-Kush Plan, an attempt to empower African Americans in the majority area, geographical areas of the South. How do you assess the progress that’s been made, beginning with his administration, but then going through yours, in terms of spreading this idea of the equitable distribution of resources?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, that is a movement that is ongoing. And we have many successes to point to in that regard. What our goal is, is to democratize power, understanding that issues of infrastructure, that we need to be able to connect, pothole to pothole, in community to community, so people in Jackson, Mississippi, understand why there’s a community that looks just like theirs in Jamaica, Queens, New York, in Gary, Indiana, or Detroit, Michigan. In that process of fixing that pothole, in that process of how we repair our infrastructure in terms of water, what we ultimately learn is that the pothole was never your problem in the first place. Your problem is that you don’t control the decision-making process that leads to the pothole being fixed.

And so, we do that by having people’s assemblies where we engage community. We do that by participatory budgeting, understanding that the budget of the city is a moral document, and if we don’t listen to the community, listen to what the community needs and scratch where they may be itching, then it reflects what our values are as a community. We’ve done that through making sure that we extend a model which is just and transparent as we look at the issues of public safety and policing, not only making sure that we have a police ID task force populated by the community, so that they can work alongside the police department and understand how public safety must look. And so, we’ve done that in a number of ways. We’re are looking at that in terms of economic mobility and economic development in the community, understanding that we want to be a business-friendly city, but we also understand that it has to be a reciprocal relationship. And so, we lift up cooperative business models, as well, so that we can learn how we can fill the gaps.

Even as we have this conversation about water and the issue of water over the last month or so, the reality is that every effort in order to support the infrastructure of the city of Jackson has been undertaken by the residents, by the people, more than the state itself. The decision to tax themselves more in order to help the infrastructure was supported over 90% by the residents. The state isn’t filling in the gap or standing in the gap when people decide to tax themselves more. Those are people taking the issue in their own hands, realizing that we are who we’ve been waiting on. And so, we should be met in that way.

AMY GOODMAN: Mayor, very quickly, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to offer vaccines to everyone above 16. At the same time, the mask mandate has been lifted. The significance of this for your city, for Jackson?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, it’s a contradictory message, and I believe that it is dangerous. While we are happy that we can expand the opportunity for people to be vaccinated, every health professional that I have listened to, all the health professionals we listen to nationally, have indicated that it is just too soon in order to lift the mask mandate.

The city of Jackson, we execute our COVID policy based on science, not politics. And so, we will maintain our mask mandate in the city of Jackson. However, the state’s decision to do otherwise still puts us in a compromised position, because we’re not only the capital city, we’re the capital of healthcare. What that means is, is as surrounding cities may not issue the mask mandate, when their residents, unfortunately, fall victim to the virus, they will overburden our hospitals in the city of Jackson, leaving not only our residents in greater danger, but those individuals who seek hospitalization or seek medical attention for a myriad of other issues, even outside of COVID. And so, I think that it is contradictory. I think that it is confusing. And I think that it is ill-timed.

54,7-Apr-21,BuzzFeed News,"In Jackson, Mississippi, You Can Go Into Debt Trying To Take A Shower","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative. They avoided using the bathroom as much as possible, and when they couldn’t hold it anymore, they stretched black trash bags across the toilet to capture waste and then poured in bleach. They boiled bottled water to cook, and they used baby wipes to clean their bodies. But on day five, Robinson, a single mother, faced the inevitable: She needed to shower to go to work, and that meant overdrafting her bank account by $500 to cover six nights in a hotel outside of town.

In February, freezing temperatures knocked out power and water across the Southeast, leaving millions of people scrambling to stay warm and unable to access basic supplies for days. But in Jackson, most of the city’s 160,000 residents, 82% of whom are Black, were without safe, reliable water for more than a month. It marked the latest chapter in years of issues with a brittle and decaying water system, and highlights the deep vulnerability of aging infrastructure — a problem from Flint, Michigan, to Sandbranch, Texas, and Newark, New Jersey — as extreme weather becomes more routine with climate change.

The recent water crisis has been especially devastating for Black women like Robinson, who is the sole provider for her family. People working in shops and restaurants lost entire paychecks when their workplaces closed due to lack of water. Kids couldn’t go to school or daycare, so parents had to shell out extra money for food and babysitters. They had to divert money away from rent or other bills to buy bottled water and cover the costs associated with being unable to bathe, do laundry, or cook in their own homes.

“It’s everyday life to me. I don’t know how else to describe it because I am so used to surviving that way,” Robinson said. “As far as our Black culture, it’s our culture, what people say is resilience, it’s just us.”

The water is flowing again in Jackson. But for Robinson and others who are barely getting by, the empty taps left debt and new worries about the future. Years of neglect of the water system had already brought poor service and outrageous bills. In the face of a changing climate, the problems can only get worse, and so far, residents have had to pay the price.

Jackson, the capital of the poorest, Blackest state in the nation, has been flailing for a long time. Decades of white flight and mismanagement, coupled with broken, antiquated infrastructure, have hampered its growth and thus its ability to revitalize itself. City leaders have estimated it would cost around $2 billion, though they recently asked the state for $47 million, to fix its water systems, which, due to a meager pool of public funds, it just can’t do. And the state has historically refused to step in and help, with Gov. Tate Reeves last month calling on the city to collect overdue bills from locals before seeking state support. The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. City officials, and experts who advise them, have argued that the water system’s ratepayers simply cannot shoulder those massive costs.

“What is on the line is really overwhelming,” Dominika Parry, a climate economist who lives in Jackson and founded 2CMississippi, a nonprofit climate change action group, explained to BuzzFeed News. “It’s a failure of lack of support from the state. And when you have a concentration of Black families who are low-income…and a state that refuses to acknowledge climate change, it’s not a sustainable situation, and we are seeing the consequences.”

It’s people like Robinson who have to “take it,” the climate economist said. This time, that meant a hefty hotel bill and overdraft fees. The next disaster could be worse, she added.

“When we have floods, hurricanes, and heat, those who can’t afford to leave die.”

Robinson has lived in Jackson for 22 years, and she and thousands of other residents have grown used to their pipes bursting or sputtering out dark liquid, as well as random shutoffs, while still getting hit with high and inconsistent bills. They’ve grown accustomed to having to boil their water, knowing that the lead in their corroded systems might still poison them, and watching sewage bubble up in their backyards.

Officials have for years warned pregnant residents and children under 5 not to drink the tap water. The city sends boil water notices about five times a year and shuts taps off entirely when a water main busts. On top of that, residents have to bear the brunt of a broken billing system that became even more of a debacle after former mayor Harvey Johnson signed a contract with Siemens Inc. and several subcontractors in 2012 who, according to a lawsuit later filed by the city, manipulated the rules to jack up prices and further gouge Jackson for water.

City officials reached a $89.8 million settlement last March, but residents are still dealing with sporadic and spiked bills. After not getting a bill for about a year, Ronnie Crudup Jr., a state representative who was born and raised in Jackson, went to the department in person to see what was going on and found that he owed $2,500 for water, he told BuzzFeed News.

“Water bills are all over the place. $1,500 up to $10,000. We don’t fully know the true costs,” he said. “People are suing the city because they don’t believe their water bills are accurate. People are not getting bills and people can’t pay the percentage of the bill they need to. As a result, we’re not collecting.”

Then came February’s storms, a new crisis that no one had expected would leave the city waterless for so long, nor the financial ramifications it would continue to have for residents who were already struggling.

Robinson makes $16,800 a year as a teacher’s assistant for students with special needs in the Lincoln County School District, about $21,000 less than the state’s median income. It’s her purpose, she said, to nurture the students “so many people sweep under the rug,” but that small paycheck makes supporting her own kids a constant, stressful calculation.

If she “budgets right,” Robinson can manage to feed her family of three for just $100 a week and then sets aside $180 for electricity, $80 for gas, and $1,000 for rent each month. And for all the years she’s lived in Jackson, water has always been an issue, so she’s factored that in. Despite having a filtration system and setting aside about $120 to pay a chunk of her bill, she still spends about $40 to $50 on bottled water monthly.","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative.
But in Jackson, most of the city’s 160,000 residents, 82% of whom are Black, were without safe, reliable water for more than a month.

56,11-Mar-21,Bustle,How To Help Those Affected By The Water Crisis In Mississippi,"A few weeks ago, the dangerous winter weather conditions that hit the southern U.S. made headlines across the country, with much of the attention placed on Texas. But those in neighboring areas were just as impacted by the extreme winter storm. Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst. Weeks later and many residents are still without any drinking or flushing water.

The city — and roughly 5,000 of its residents, the majority of which are low-income Black families — is experiencing a water crisis. Cassandra Welchlin, the state organizer for the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, a network that pushes for equitable public policy for Black women and girls, tells Bustle that many people in Jackson are unable to afford food because they can’t get to work. Others are forced to stay home from their jobs because they can’t perform simple everyday tasks like taking a shower or brushing their teeth.

Weeks after the winter storm, Jackson, Mississippi is experiencing a water crisis.

She puts the blame on the state’s weak infrastructure. “This has been a long-standing problem,” says Welchlin. Politicians don’t always put resources where they need to be, she explains, which is why organizations like hers join together to provide support for the community. Through donations, the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable has organized water drives, provided gift cards for hotel stays and groceries, and provided outreach to find water to use from neighboring towns. “We’ve worked with a legislature from the Mississippi Gulf Coast to get truckloads of water brought into the city,” Welchlin says. She was then able to partner with local schools and community leaders to distribute the water to those in need.

Welchlin is now mobilizing community members to help those hardest hit groups like the elderly and single moms, and is urging residents who have cars to take water to the homes of the elderly so they can simply flush their toilets. She’s also been collecting donations like diapers and baby food to help single mothers who abruptly lost work and didn’t qualify for paid leave.

More than anything, Welchlin says residents and the organizations helping to restore these families are still in need of donations because people are still without water and struggling to get essential household and personal items. If you’re looking to help, you can donate to these local organizations that support families across Mississippi:","Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst.

57,24-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,‘A profound betrayal of trust’: Why Jackson’s water system is broken,"Janna Avalon, a 72-year-old retired newspaper editor, lived out the mid-February ice storm and weeks-long water outage just feet from South Jackson’s empty water tower.

The one million-gallon tank, one of several across the city, is meant to store water at a high elevation, utilizing gravity to pressurize the delivery system, especially during service interruptions.

But contingency plans are a myth in a system as chronically broken as Jackson’s.

So for the better part of the last month, Avalon and her husband Billy heaved buckets of water they retrieved from government tankers, kind neighbors or rainfall into their home to flush their toilet or wash dishes.

Most Jacksonians lost running water altogether after back-to-back winter storms the week of Feb. 14 stunned unprepared utilities across the Deep South, and the Avalons were some of the roughly 43,000 people whose taps remained dry for more than two weeks. City officials were still telling most residents, 82% of whom are Black, to boil their water a month later.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government … when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered, it’s a profound betrayal of trust.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

In the Avalons’ spacious backyard — beyond a wooden playset, garden and plum trees, plastic flamingos and decorative stone statues — the water tower adds its own charm. Avalon said it reflects colors in the evening sky, prolonging sunsets.

“It’s got all these great little attributes,” Avalon said, “except water.”

Avalon grew up in Jackson and has lived in her home, where she raised her five children, for 28 years. Despite ongoing utility hiccups, she’s intent on staying. She asks why she should have to move — and contribute to the city’s population decline of 20% since 1980 — to access basic human services. Why city and state government officials can’t or won’t improve conditions where she already lives. Why her water bills are unreliable, why nobody reads her water meter, and why there is a “huge city water tower in our backyard and there’s no water in it.”

The questions seem simple, but the answers are complex, and the dysfunction is causing a rift between Jacksonians and their leaders.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government,” said Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. “It comes into your house. You take it into your body. We put our children in it, and we prepare food with it. And when that fails — when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered — it’s a profound betrayal of trust. And it shakes you to your core.”

Many Jacksonians lacked access to clean drinking water long before the most recent storm. In fact, on a good day, officials advise pregnant people and children under five not to drink from the tap, a phenomenon that’s been the case for the last five years.

“And most people in Jackson don’t even know,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, told Mississippi Today during the recent outage. “The city and the state have done nothing to provide water to those populations. This whole time they should have been providing water for pregnant people and children under five. This whole time.”

And yet, when Jackson water customers do receive a bill (because consistent and accurate billing has also been a problem), they’re sometimes paying exorbitant amounts for water that’s unsafe to drink.

Every city water bill notifies customers of the hazard of high lead levels first found in Jackson’s tap water in 2016, caused by recurring faulty water treatment techniques that remain unaddressed.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city’s water system presented “imminent and substantial endangerment” to its customers and could contain E. Coli.

Water outages and the presence of harmful contaminants when the water does reach the tap are two different scenarios with unique sets of threats, but they both stem from decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance within a dysfunctional and outdated water treatment and delivery system.

And the risks of scarce or dirty water exist more often in the homes of families who are already burdened by the ongoing pandemic, low wages, stagnant wealth, a lack of quality health care and racism.

The city is faced with two colliding but distinct funding problems: One, the city’s infrastructure is only getting older and past administrations did not plan for inevitable future capital investments, as is true in many aging cities. Two, the loss of customer base and pervasive billing troubles have left the water department without a feasible revenue model for regular operations and maintenance.

“This is like a triple or quadruple whammy, what’s going on,” said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at D.C.-based Center for Community Progress. “One layer is the fact that older cities — completely leaving aside race, poverty, all that — are at a disadvantage to young cities.”

“Then you get the second layer,” Mallach continued. “You have this whole phenomenon which has been going on really since the 1950s, where older cities, central cities, have essentially been abandoned by large parts of the middle class, especially the white middle class, for the suburbs.”

Winter storms in past years — 1989, 1994, 2010, 2014 and most recently 2018 — have tested the city’s outdated water delivery system and caused widespread water main breaks and outages. Each time, the city has scrambled to make band-aid repairs, only to wait until the next catastrophe. Jackson isn’t alone in taking this approach, said Teodoro, the Wisconsin professor.

“The nature of local politics is that city governments will tend to neglect utilities until they break because they’re literally buried,” he said. “One of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe. But the price is very easy for them to observe.”

Not even EPA orders — including a decade-old consent decree over the city’s wastewater system that continues to release raw sewage into the Pearl River — have resulted in much meaningful action. City water and sewer systems are not like corporations, Teodoro said; the authorities can’t just take their license away. And imposing large fines only punishes the taxpayers they are supposed to be protecting. “In the end, there’s very little you can do,” Teodoro said of regulators.

“They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund

This year, Jackson officials said, issues were particularly pronounced at the water treatment plants, which are not enclosed and protected from the elements like plants typically are up north.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams told the media that the screens through which water from the reservoir is filtered had frozen, rendering the plant incapable of taking in water, causing pressure to drop across the system. Operators didn’t discover the issue until the weekend after the storms. They also encountered malfunctioning raw water pumps.

Also, the 10 million gallon basins where filtered reservoir water is stored before it is chemically treated contained two feet of sludge due to an overdose in chemicals that occured over time when water wasn’t coming in — a possible human error, Williams said. The city took two basins offline to clean them the week after the storm and cleaned the third a couple weeks later.

In addition to needed equipment upgrades, the city is sorely lacking the personnel needed to operate the plant in its current condition. City officials rely on these operators to notify them of an event, such as sludge build up, that they need to address. Jackson employs three high-level operators at each of its water treatment plants, when each facility really needs six of these top officials, Williams told Mississippi Today. In 2018, there were 60 unfilled positions in Public Works, Clarion Ledger reported.

“You have to maintain what you have until you’re able to make improvements,” Williams said. “But once again, you have to have funding.”

Two generations of white and wealth flight out of Jackson has reduced the built-in revenue that officials say the water system needs just to maintain full operations, including hiring personnel — let alone to make a dent in an estimated $1 billion worth of needed upgrades.

The city’s bungled attempt to revamp its water meter and billing system through a $90 million contract with German-based manufacturer Siemens only worsened the water department’s cash flow — not to mention public confidence — while any outside investment in the capital city has come at a crawl.

“And we all know why,” Roberts, the activist, said. “Nobody wants to invest in Jackson because of who runs Jackson and who lives in Jackson. Because white folks don’t dominate here anymore. They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.”

With a population that’s 82% African American, Jackson is the single Blackest large city in the nation. Roughly 1-in-4 residents live in poverty, and in some west and south Jackson communities, the hardest hit by water outages, the average household pulls an income of $25,000 and as low as $15,000 in some pockets.

The capital city has lost roughly 40,000 residents since the population peaked at about 200,000 in 1980, after an initial wave of white residents left to avoid putting their children in integrated schools. Half of the decline occurred in the last two decades as more middle-class Black families moved, and the city’s white population continued to drop from 52% in 1980 to 28% in 2000 to 17% in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

As the customer base declines, the system might clean and pump out less water, but the same infrastructure remains under the surface of Jackson’s 111 square miles, an area geographically larger than Seattle, Baltimore or Cincinnati. Parts of Jackson’s 1,500 miles of water mains are over 100 years old.

Of course, pipes under streets in front of abandoned properties — about 4,000 by one 2019 count — still require maintenance.

At the same time, family resources are diminishing with inflation. Household buying power fell just slightly in the 1980s and was relatively stable through the 1990s. But since 2000, the annual median household income in Jackson has dropped about $6,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars, a roughly 15% decrease, according to a Mississippi Today analysis of Census data.

“We are a city with very high levels of poverty, and it’s difficult for us to raise the rates enough to do large scale replacement type projects and not make it unaffordable to live in the city of Jackson,” said former city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

Yet the cost of Jackson’s poor quality water is still passed on to families who don’t trust the tap and purchase bottled water — which can cost a family of four $50-$100 a month — to drink instead.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

The city raised water rates in 2013, but the Siemens deal penned the same year came with an onslaught of problems, including the installation of faulty water meters and meters that measured water in gallons instead of the correct cubic feet. This made any benefits of the rate increase virtually impossible to see.

The results have been nonsensical. Over the past several years, the city has mailed exorbitant bills to some customers and none to others. Sometimes, the charges weren’t based on how much water a household used and other times, city officials advised residents to “pay what they think they owe.” Past officials said the city lacked the manpower and expertise in the billing department to manually rectify the account issues with any speed.

In trying to protect people during the persistent billing blunders, the city has at times instituted no-shutoff policies, which demonstrate compassion but haven’t helped to compel payment.

Today, more than 8,000 customers, or nearly one-sixth of the city’s customer base, still aren’t receiving bills. Nearly 16,000 customers owe more than $100 or are more than 90 days past due, a city spokesperson told Mississippi Today. Jackson water customers owe a total of $90.3 million.

As a result, the city continues to miss out on tens of millions of water revenues. In 2016, when officials first uncovered the issue, the city’s actual water sewer collections during the previous year was a startling 32% less than projected — a roughly $26 million shortfall.

It’s a vicious cycle: revenue shortfalls make it harder for the city to purchase upgrades or hire the personnel needed to properly manage the billing system; the billing inaccuracies and sloppy accounting encourage a culture of nonpayment; the unpaid bills just further tank the revenue.

Frustration only grows as residents are expected to pay for subpar service within a utility that’s already largely taken for granted.

The city received just under $60 million out of last year’s $90 million Siemens settlement, about $33 million of which is restricted in reserves or bond covenants. Another $12.6 million went to repay the general fund, leaving about $14 million for emergency sewer repairs and a new billing system.

Lawyers got the rest — a little more than $30 million.

The story of Jackson’s failing infrastructure, national experts say, could just as easily describe the scenario in other major cities like Detroit, Toledo or Kansas City, whose leaders have had to look outside their own budgets to solve major crises.

A city rests within a state, after all, and decisions made at the state level and the impact those decisions have on the economy and public services affect what a city is able to accomplish.

“It’s really disingenuous to look at the politics and policies of any one American city in isolation from the state context in which it exists,” Teodoro said.

The residents who left Jackson in the late 20th century fled to surrounding suburbs such as Rankin County, the wealthier Republican bastion that produced many of Mississippi’s most powerful politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves.

Less than a year ago, Reeves vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided relief to poor Jacksonians with past due water bills and propped up the city’s bond rating, a proposal he suggested perpetuated a “‘free money’ concept,” Clarion Ledger reported.

A similar bill, which would apply to all municipalities, is making its way through the Legislature this session. Lawmakers also killed a bill to assist Jackson with infrastructure bonds, but it still has a chance to pass legislation that would allow the city to propose its own sales tax increase to pay for water system improvements.

Meanwhile, Speaker Philip Gunn, another top lawmaker who lives in a Jackson suburb, spent the session trying to pass tax reform that would have actually increased the tax burden on the bottom 60% of the state’s income earners, according to one study, while significantly cutting the taxes of the richest residents.

The city is also still fighting the state’s 2016 attempt to wrest control of Jackson’s airport. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during a recent mayoral debate that during a conversation with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the state Senate leader who lives in the white pocket of northeast Jackson, the lieutenant governor asked the mayor to “give me my airport” in exchange for infrastructure funding.

This ongoing tension is the backdrop for the city’s current crisis.

Academics who have studied government water systems recommend they regionalize in order to spread costs among struggling cities and more affluent suburbs. There’s just one recurring hitch to securing such an agreement: “Racism makes all of this so much harder,” Teodoro said.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.”

The history of racial conflict, Teodoro explained, creates a scenario where Black residents of the city fear losing control of their services to the same people who have systematically oppressed them. And white residents of the suburbs, who chalk the city’s problems up to incompetence, don’t feel responsible to help.

In the Jackson metro, not only is regionalization a tough sell, there are examples of the opposite happening. West Rankin Utility Authority recently splintered off to build its own wastewater treatment facility to become independent from Jackson’s Savannah Street Wastewater Treatment Plant.

It’s twofold: Systemic racism is an unmistakable underlying cause for Jackson’s stripped resources, and while it may be clouded by a mutual distrust today, racism continues to prevent future investment.

For Avalon, a white woman, understanding the decline of her majority-Black community is as easy as pointing to the state’s refusal to fully fund education or expand Medicaid.

“Racism is everywhere,” Avalon said. “We need to recognize what we’re talking about. If my kid goes to public school that’s not up to par, why? We’re all paying taxes.”

The storage tank on Avalon’s street wasn’t full of water, Williams explained, because as the system loses pressure on an ongoing basis, not just during storms, the tower is constantly drained to make up for the deficiencies. He said he didn’t know if that tank had ever been full.

South Jackson often bears the brunt of water crises because the area is one of the furthest away from the treatment plant, so water takes longer to travel there. What little water would have been inside the tower at the time of the storm was used up immediately by some of the roughly 70,000 people who live in South Jackson.

That’s a convenient explanation for Avalon, who says her community is always last to receive attention on a variety of issues. “We’ve been putting up with that stuff all my life in south Jackson,” she said.

Jackson City Councilman De’Keither Stamps pushed the council to ask the state for $60 million, in addition to an initial $47 million proposal, to build new water storage towers in South Jackson and Byram to build up capacity in those areas.

“You shouldn’t have to live your life in fear of the plant going down,” Stamps said. “You should have enough capacity within a short distance from your house to maintain yourself.”

On March 1, just as water was starting to trickle out of her tap, Avalon stood on her back porch as it rained and looked out at the empty water reservoir that engulfs the skyline. City contractors had just come out a few years ago to repaint its dingy exterior, she recalled. Some 100 feet up, a large black fowl crouched on top of the massive steel structure stamped with the City of Jackson seal.

“If they’re vultures, gosh, that’s a terrible omen,” she said with a chuckle.

Water pressure in the Avalon home fell again in the following days as city officials discovered the facility’s intake filters were clogged with clams, mussels, tree branches and other items and had to take the systems offline. The Avalons had to shut off their water again the following weekend because of a broken pipe on their property. They’ll expect outages to continue.

“It keeps coming back and slapping us in the face, and we can’t do anything about it,” Avalon said.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city’s water system presented “imminent and substantial endangerment” to its customers and could contain E. Coli.
“One of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe.

58,7-Mar-21,NewsOne,Jackson Water Crisis: Organizers See Collective Effort As Critical To Community Sustainability,"NewsOne Featured Video CLOSE

While the Mississippi city of Jackson works to fully restore water, various community organizations have been filling in the gaps with relief. Mutual aid is a new term for some, but providing it is an old practice in many Black communities.

“As a southern Black girl, who grew up in rural Mississippi, mutual aid has always existed in my life,” Calandra Davis, an organizer with the Jackson chapter of Black Youth Project 100 (BYP 100), told NewsOne. Davis said community institutions have always provided aid in times of need. “The churches [and families] in my community always provided mutual aid,” she added.

Providing support to communities in Jackson and across the state, the Mississippi Rapid Response & Relief Coalition is a statewide coalition, including rural partners. Member organizations include the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, the People’s Advocacy Institute, the Milestone Cooperative, Mississippi M.O.V.E., Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition, BYP 100 and Sarah’s Touch.

Davis said the organizations took on various roles in the storm’s aftermath, each finding its own lane.

“Some people were preparing and delivering food,” Davis explained. “Others were helping to find water and get it out to people.”

She said BYP 100 helped get money into the hands and pockets of people who lost income.

“We also secured hotels for folks who were without power and water,” Davis shared.

Members of the coalition were engaged in community outreach work even before the current water crisis.

“We take a holistic approach,” Sharon Brown, founder and executive director of the Council of Sisterhood, a philanthropic organization, said. “[Our] work didn’t shift, it became harder because we couldn’t get the supplies that we needed to provide for the people in the community.”

Brown said she founded the Council of Sisterhood in 2013 with her sister Valerie Brown.

“We started the organization because we saw the needs of our community not being met because of systemic racism,” Brown explained. She said that her organization has provided everything from clothing to food and even money to help pay utility bills.

“The village is only as strong as the members,” said Brown. “And so if you have one family hurting, then the whole community hurts and suffers.”

The current crisis comes as communities continue to deal with COVID-19. Mississippi is one of two states that recently lifted pandemic restrictions put in place to protect public health and safety.

The disregard for Black lives has been clear even before the pandemic, but existing through the layered crisis has been a real eye-opener for some people.

“We’re really just seeing environmental issues and racism paired together,” Davis said. “And [there are] no real systemic solutions are being offered.”

Rukia Lumumba agreed with Davis and framed the current crisis as a part of a larger challenge.

“Over the last few years, we’ve just been seeing the weather changes become more significant,” Lumumba said in an interview with NewsOne. “And it has consistently harmed our communities, more so than any other community.”

Lumumba is the founder and executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, an organization she envisioned alongside her father, the late Mayor Chokwe Lumumba. She is also the older sister of Jackson’s current mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. At its core, the People’s Advocacy Institute is a community capacity-building and training organization. Lumumba and her team, along with partner organizations, work to uplift impacted communities.

While the city has set up local distribution sites, Lumumba sees the grassroots relief effort as people stepping up to do what needs to be done. She said once the roads were safe, some people drove as long as two hours to find water.

As a part of the Rapid Response and Relief Coalition, Lumumba and the People’s Advocacy Institute fielded requests for food or hotel assistance, water distribution and even money.

“We’ve seen a decline in people asking for hotels,” Lumumba explained. “But now we’ve seen an increase in people asking for financial assistance to cover everything that they lost.”

From pipe repairs and fixing other related damage to buying groceries, people have incurred additional expenses because of the winter weather and water outage.

She said the groups have provided support in Jackson and the greater Hind County area as well as several rural communities from the Mississippi Delta to communities in central and northern Mississippi.

“The collective effort is critical to our sustainability,” said Lumumba. “Our livelihood [and] our ability to survive is intertwined with our ability to work together.”

Lumumba recounted the first week of the winter storm that left highways closed and services disrupted all over.

“Prior to this, anytime there were any major weather changes, our water system was in jeopardy of shutting down in certain areas of town,” explained Lumumba.

She said this impacted South and West Jackson more than any other areas, noting these are predominantly Black and poor areas of the city.

When asked about the state response, Lumumba described the governor’s attitude and approach as a part of a long-held disregard the state’s white elected officials have for both the city’s Black leadership and residents. At one point late last month, the governor made a comment about the state taking over Jackson’s water system.

“What really needs to be done is major infrastructure investment on the federal and state level,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder and Executive Director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, said last week on MSNBC show “The Reid Out.” She challenged claims that the governor could not reach Mayor Lumumba, as Jackson is the Mississippi state capitol placing the governor in close proximity to city government officials handling a crisis.

“But that’s how little the priority is,” Roberts continued. “And it’s not just Jackson, the Mississippi Delta is without water right now.”

Looking forward, Lumumba said the coalition is thinking about how to operationalize how they do rapid response.

“What we’re trying to do now is think about how we create these rapid response hubs,” she shared. “We know that there are going to be more and more storms and changing weather conditions that shift how we’re currently living. There is no guarantee that we are not going to be able to live the way [we do].”

Brown said climate change is real and needs to be a factor considered in whatever next steps are taken.

“And this will not be the first crisis, but one of many crises,” she said. “Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the nation, but at the end of the day, it’s a group of folks that really love and care genuinely about what happens with our community…we represent, and we stand in love.”

Davis compared the current moment to other times of awakening that brought people into organizing. She said some people had “an aha moment” after the killing of Trayvon Martin or last summer with the killing of George Floyd.

“For some folks in rural Mississippi and Jackson it is going to be the ice storm and water crisis,” said Davis. “I believe [this crisis] will cause people to collectively come together [and] use their power to make some structural changes to what has been happening in the city for decades now.”

60,5-Mar-21,Voice of America,"Weeks After Winter Storms, Mississippi City Still Grappling With Water Crisis","JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI - Officials in Mississippi's largest city, Jackson, are aiming to have running water largely restored by the weekend, nearly three weeks after devastating winter weather left tens of thousands of residents without service.

The city was again distributing non-potable water Friday at four sites so people can flush their toilets, and residents must still boil any faucet water before using it for food preparation, drinking, washing dishes or brushing teeth.

Charles Williams, the city's public works director, said Thursday that workers should soon be able to sample enough water to lift the boil advisory.

""I see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Williams said at a news conference, sounding more optimistic than he did Wednesday, when problems at the city's treatment plant caused pressure to drop across the entire system. At that time, he estimated that about a quarter of Jackson's 43,000 water connections — most of which serve multiple households — were not operating.

Ben Mitchell and Deon Sanders work at a public water distribution site after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, in Jackson, Mississippi, March 4, 2021.

Officials did not have an updated estimate as of Friday, though city spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the system was able maintain pressure overnight.

Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water to perform the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.

She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. Her husband's uncle, however, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.

""It was very stressful,"" said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ""third-world country.""

The problems stem from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down the state's power grid and leaving millions without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.

Jackson, the state capital with a population of more than 160,000 people, has seen more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said.

The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves earlier this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson's water system.

Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children finally had water service return Thursday after more than two weeks without it. ""I was like, 'Oh Lord,'"" she said with relief.

Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.

The crisis has also shuttered businesses across the city.

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie's New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint, would open Friday for the first time since February 17 after getting water restored Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Bakery & Cafe, meanwhile, were spending all day on Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening Saturday morning.

62,25-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,"Policy experts explore Jackson water solutions, highlight void in federal aid","The fragility of Jackson’s water system, plagued by decades of outmigration, deferred maintenance and declining federal support, was on full national display in February after a historic freeze left at least 40,000 without running water for weeks.

City officials are asking for state and federal support to help raise the $1 billion they say is needed to fix the system, which failed to produce safe drinking water for more than a month after the storm.

Mississippi Today spoke with several national policy experts about how other American cities have navigated large-scale water funding shortages and how Jackson could move forward. The experts offered several solutions, chronicled in the article below, but ultimately agreed that the absence of a more involved federal government leaves few answers for Jackson.

“A lot of these systems that are on the brink of falling apart, they’re just one extreme event away from a crisis,” said Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University. “That’s what happened in Jackson. It’s a cumulative effect of not investing in our infrastructure for so many years. Aging infrastructure, all of these extreme events that we’re experiencing, it’s all coming together.”

Some signs of short-term relief have trickled in during the past couple weeks. Jackson is set to receive $47 million from the American Rescue Plan, the name of the new $1.9 trillion stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed last week. Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced a bill in Congress that would steer infrastructure funds towards the city.

But those measures still leave Jackson a long way from the necessary funding to repair and revamp its water system.

Federal water infrastructure support has plummeted since the 1970s, when the U.S. sent funds to cities to help comply with the newly-passed Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts. In 1977, federal support accounted for 31% of governments’ total water utility spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By 2017, that share had dropped to 4%.

Now, such spending largely comes in the form of loans rather than grants, mainly through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act that supports specific projects, as well as an annual allotment called the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which last year totaled $2.7 billion for the whole country.

“If Jackson alone has a $1 billion need, and the total EPA State Revolving Fund is $2.7 billion, that starts to give you an order of magnitude of how big the problem is versus how much money is actually available,” said Dr. Martin Doyle, Director for Water Policy at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University.

As for many cities with rupturing infrastructure, the decline in federal support has coincided with Jackson’s sharp decline in population, which has shrunk by 20% since 1980.

Ajami, Doyle, and others discussed with Mississippi Today the ways other cities have tried to boost water infrastructure funding, such as consolidation and privatization, as well as different approaches to water billing.

Consolidation of regional water systems

For many cities, capital improvements such as upgrades to treatment plants and large-scale pipe replacements are simply unaffordable for their tax bases. Those cities instead focus what money is available towards regular operations and maintenance. But as bigger projects get pushed back, their costs only grow.

Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University

“The cost of recovering from the crisis is much higher than the cost of prevention,” Ajami said.

One successful cost-saving solution is consolidating utilities with neighboring towns and cities, similar to the way school districts merge to save money.

In 2014, after the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy, a court ordered the creation of a regional authority that assumed the city’s water and sewer services. The Great Lake Water Authority took on $4 billion in debt from the city, and Detroit officials said the change allowed it to make infrastructure upgrades it couldn’t otherwise afford. Similarly, Raleigh, N.C., saw a decrease in maintenance and operation costs after combining utilities with nearby municipalities in the early 2000s.

“That starts to increase the scale of the operation, which means that you’re able to gain some efficiencies,” Doyle said.

In the U.S., there are more than 50,000 water utilities that operate independently, meaning they each have their own management and set of personnel, from engineers to customer service. When places combine utilities, they’re often able to serve the same populations at a lower fixed cost.

Despite the cost-saving potential, some city officials are unsure if Jackson and its neighbors could come to such an agreement, especially considering political and racial differences.

“I think it would be a difficult political thing to put a regional water system together, just because there’s a lack of trust issue,” said Jackson city councilman Ashby Foote. “A lot of the surrounding communities, I don’t think they would let Jackson run it, and I don’t think the city would vote to relinquish control of the systems.”

Foote and Jackson councilman De’Keither Stamps cited disagreements such as control over Jackson’s airport and the recent decision by West Rankin County officials to break off and build its own wastewater facility.

“Now (West Rankin) has to spend all this money to build a new sewer plant because of relationships and politics,” Stamps said. “How does that benefit the end user?”

Privatization of Jackson’s water system

While not as popular, privatization is a similar solution to consolidation, explained Doyle, who explored water-funding solutions for shrinking cities in an article for the American Water Works Association journal. Private water utilities, which serve 15% of Americans, can combine functions just as a regional utility would and can also provide more resources and expertise. Research also shows they are less likely to violate the EPA’s health-related drinking water statutes than public utilities.

The main concern around private utilities is cost. If a company took over Jackson’s water system, it would have to justify any rate increases with the state’s Public Service Commission; however, Doyle’s paper cites that “it is not uncommon for water rates to increase by greater than 10% when public systems are privatized, and in some cases, rates have reportedly almost doubled.”

Doyle said while it’s unclear how much more a private utility would cost Jackson, it should be considered a “tool in the toolkit.” Ajami and others were more skeptical.

“I don’t think privatization is going to solve the water problem for Jackson,” Ajami argued. “It’s probably going to make water more unaffordable. Their system will be upgraded, I’m just not sure that will lead to more affordable water rates for Jackson.”

Former Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. said he turned down the idea while in office.

“That idea was thrown out, I rejected it,” said Johnson, who was mayor from 1997 to 2005 and again from 2009 and 2013. He asserted that private companies don’t have the same accountability as elected officials, and that cities can get locked into long-term contracts without a way out. “The driving force there is the bottom line, it’s not service.”

Jackson City Council President Aaron Banks said that whether it’s consolidation or privatization, Jackson leadership needs to be open-minded.

“I think we have to explore all those options,” Banks said.

Balancing affordability and water revenue

Despite the city’s long list of needed system improvements, officials know that raising water rates could make the service unaffordable in a place where 1-in-4 residents live below the poverty line.

Even if Jackson leaders had the political will to raise customers’ rates, paying for a $1 billion municipal bond would add $55 to $60 a month in charges to every household, or about a full day’s work on minimum wage, according to associate professor Manuel Teodoro of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.

In 2017, Philadelphia took an innovative approach to address affordability: its Tiered Assistance Program, the first of its kind in the country, allows low-income residents to make payments based on earnings rather than water usage, and it also provides a path for debt forgiveness. Like in Jackson, many Philadelphia residents had built up water debt and weren’t contributing to the city’s water revenue. Since TAP began, the city simultaneously reduced water bill debt and increased the number of customers paying for the service.

Henrietta Locklear, vice president at financial consultant firm Raftelis, worked on Philadelphia’s assistance program and told Mississippi Today that such a system could work in Jackson should the city decide to increase water rates.

“The role is really more to say, ‘We have to have rate increases, and we know it’s going to affect some of our customers detrimentally, and we’re offering assistance to help customers in need,’” Locklear said.

Adjusting the water billing formula

Another way to stabilize revenue could be to adjust the city’s billing formula. Ajami, the Stanford policy expert, explained that while Jackson’s first priority is addressing emergency repairs to its system, the city should also aim to maximize its future water funding.

Jackson, like many cities, charges residents based on both water usage and tiered pricing, which adds a fee after a certain threshold. Customers are charged $3.21 per hundred cubic feet, and then a $7 flat fee is added after 300 cubic feet, or a little over 2,000 gallons, according to a city spokesperson.

Cities rely heavily on volumetric, or use-based, pricing because the more water a utility treats and delivers, the more strain it puts on the system. Yet volumetric pricing can leave a utility with varying revenue returns, Ajami said.

“If you use a gallon or 10 gallons, I still need to operate the treatment plant, I still need to maintain the pipes, I still need to operate the pumps,” Ajami said. “If people use less (water), they’re paying less, and then I have less money to do all those things.”

She said that Jackson would benefit from some combination of its current system and a “decoupled” rate — a common format for energy bills — which includes a fixed rate that pays for the utility’s routine operating costs.

Doyle added that the varying, volumetric nature of water bills stands out from other government revenue streams.

“A lot of the services we get are not use-based,” he said. Many roads, for instance, are mostly paid for by property taxes, not by how much a person drives. “Same thing for jails, same thing for city governments, same thing for school systems.”

In light of affordability issues, Doyle and Ajami both wondered why the U.S. has no federal safety net for water bills.

“You can get money from the federal government to assist you in being able to pay for household food and energy,” Doyle said. “You can’t get that for water, and that’s kind of weird.”

Ajami agreed, pointing to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for energy bills, and the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program that helps with phone bills.

“In a way you’re all subsidizing access to communication, which is important,” she said, “but if we have something like that, why can’t we have something similar for water?”

A “barometer” of segregation

Jackson leaders in the past few weeks have asked state and federal officials to provide the city with money to begin repairing its water and sewer system.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba met with newly-appointed EPA Administrator Michael Regan to discuss funding avenues, and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson pledged to support any request for federal help.

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann told Mississippi Today that state legislators “want to help.” Yet Hosemann, as well as Gov. Tate Reeves and Sen. Hyde-Smith, have criticized the city’s management of its past funding without mentioning other systemic causes that led to the crisis.

Mississippi Today reported on Wednesday that legislative leaders killed the city’s main ask to improve its water system: allow the Jackson City Council’s proposal to increase the city’s sales tax by 1 cent to be placed on to a citywide ballot.

“If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.” Harvey Johnson Jr., former Jackson mayor

Activists and academics who spoke with Mississippi Today described the way racism has fueled the inability of the 82% Black-city to address infrastructure needs, from white flight to a lack of state support.

Yet even with more state-led enthusiasm, Mississippi alone can’t afford Jackson’s funding needs, said former Jackson city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

“While we always talk about, ‘We want more help from the state,’ the state doesn’t really have a big pool of money available to flow down to municipalities for this,” Priester said.

Priester and Johnson, Jackson’s former mayor, emphasized that the federal government’s deflated water funding has only inflated the city’s need. For instance, Jackson is struggling to fight its way out of an EPA consent decree for violations under the Clean Water Act, and last year received a $500,000 fine for violations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

“There’s no resources coming from the federal government to help local governments to meet those standards,” Johnson said. “If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.”

Ajami agrees that political willingness is part of the issue, adding that the disconnect between Americans and how they receive water may be why there’s a lack of political pressure.

“Because it’s easy to access water for a majority of Americans, people don’t think about the complexity of the system that brings water to us,” she said. “You drive on the road, so if there are potholes, you experience them. You don’t see water pipes. It’s a hidden infrastructure that we don’t value as much, while it’s the most essential resource we depend on in our daily life.”

Ajami also underscored the impacts of funding shortages on a city’s poorer and disadvantaged citizens: they can’t afford to rely on bottled water or a filtration system, and they’re left with an aging infrastructure that their local government can’t afford to fix.

“We’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities.” Dr. Martin Doyle

Cities have fallen into a cycle where the inability to afford repairs compounds the effects of the broken system, which is largely what created the desperation Jackson felt this past month. That’s why, Doyle explained, water utilities have become a good indicator of disparities across the country.

“Paying for water in a rich city is, on a per population basis, very cheap,” he said. “Paying for water in a poorer city on a per population basis is really expensive. So we’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities. That’s why I think one of the best barometers of how that big sorting in America is actually taking place is in the water utilities.”

Is water back on in Jackson?

All Jackson water customers now have water running through their faucets although some areas of the city are still experiencing low water pressure, Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday.

Williams said he determined residents are getting water from checking with residents in areas where shortages were occurring and gauging the water pressure in nearby fire hydrants.

Jackson is still under a boil notice

A majority of Jackson's water customers remain under a citywide boil water notice, meaning the water is still unsafe to drink or use for other common activities such as brushing teeth unless it is boiled first.

The about 43,000 customers on the surface water system might see the boil water notice lifted this week, provided the city is able to sample the water supply on two consecutive days.

The city last week lifted a notice on the 16,000 customers who receive their water from the city's well system. Those customers live in parts of south Jackson and Byram.

No disaster declaration in Mississippi

There is still no federal disaster declaration in Mississippi as the city of Jackson enters the fourth week of its water crisis.

Gov. Tate Reeves has until to submit Sunday a declaration to the White House and FEMA.

Several southern states have been approved for emergency declarations that open the door for federal assistance amid recovery from brutal winter storms that knocked out power and water services to millions in February.

There were all smiles on the field during Jackson State's 53-0 win over Edward Waters on Sunday.

A COVID-limited sold out crowd of 11,000 fans showed up. The Tigers' defense anchored the program's first shutout since 2014. Even Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman showed up on the sidelines to support former Dallas Cowboys teammate Deion Sanders as he coached his first college football game.

There was just one noticeable issue inside of Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium - there was no running water.

The City of Jackson and surrounding areas have been without water or have experienced extremely low pressure for the greater part of the last two weeks since last week's winter storm rocked the state.

Jackson State's football stadium was no exception to the city's water crisis, as all attendees, media, players, coaches, fans and stadium workers alike had to use portable toilets. Aikman was seen carrying a jug of water into the stadium upon arrival.

The reality didn't hit Sanders until he received his Gatorade bath in the closing seconds of the win.

""(It was) cold, and sticky,"" Sanders said. ""The first thing that came to my mind is, 'We don't have a shower. We don't have water. We have a shower, but we don't have water.' That's the first thing that came to my mind.""

The Pro Football Hall of Famer said he expected the bath to come, so he prepared for the moment by bringing a fresh change of clothes.

""It was good though,"" Sanders said. ""Especially my kids enjoyed it the most. I think they enjoyed it the most. Just to share that first moment with your sons is incredible.""

As far as the actual game goes, Sanders said the stadium's water situation didn't bother his focus.

""We couldn't tell,"" Sanders said. ""I think the only time water is a concern is during the timeouts, and we took care of that. The staff took care of that, so we're fine in that aspect.""

The coach said he was unsure if running water returned to the stadium on Tuesday afternoon.

""I don't know what's going on outside this building, and outside the walls of this team,"" Sanders said.

About four miles away from the stadium on JSU's campus, water was still out as of Wednesday evening. The University encouraged all students to return home until the conflict could get resolved. The University will remain open to those who can't travel

As you are aware, the recent interruption in water services for the City of Jackson has inadvertently affected Jackson State University

Junior receiver Daylen Baldwin echoed Sanders' reaction in Sunday's postgame press conference.

""The ice storm cut off a couple of necessities to our life,"" Baldwin said. ""Other than that, we still went out and played.""

66,31-Mar-21,Kulture Hub,"How does Jackson, Mississippi still not have clean water?","America the great – I believe it to be. But still, there is consistent evidence that America does not care about many of its residents. For people (mostly Black people) in Jackson, Mississippi, and Flint, Michigan, who are still without clean water, this must feel like the case.

Flint, Michigan has been a town without clean water for nearly a decade. The city’s nearly $100M project to destroy all lead pipes has nearly been completed. Still, residents must amend their amenities by alternative means to receive clean water. And the same goes now for residents of Jackson, MS.

What is our current country status?

Since when has it become alright to let reasonable people go without? The more that capitalism swallows our prideful principles, the more that America morphs into a third-world country. America does not treat itself or its people well and exists with many self-serving tendencies.

So maybe it isn’t too much to ask for a thriving nation to grant access to clean water in every one of its active cities. Unfortunately, another leak has sprouted as this year continues to reveal the rust on our foundation. Jackson, Mississippi, and Flint Michigan need clean water. Plain and simple.

Awful winter storm damages Jackson, MS’s clean water

The issue in Jackson, Mississippi resembles the Texas power storm grid disaster. The infrastructure in play is not equipped to handle the current stress the system is experiencing.

In mid-February, a harsh and late-season snowstorm did a number on the city of Jackson, MS. On February 17, the city created a boil water notice and was forced to shut down its water supply for a period of time. This left more than 70,000 residents of Jackson without access to clean water.

The lack of clean water situation was harrowingly similar to that in Flint.

Jackson, Miss. residents are struggling with access to a basic human right.

Today, the water is nowhere near its daily standard capacity with reports of only 37 lbs of pressure per sq. inch being pumped through the pipes as opposed to a successful 90 lbs of pressure per sq. inch.

Issues as heinous as this one make us beg the question as to where our priorities lie? I know everyone always has something to complain about and it takes so much to make us happy. But, it seems like running water is something that should be handled with greater preparation and alternative gameplans.

The world unravels in layers

Regardless, we are entering the craziest decade in history and I hope that these extracurricular happenings do not continue to become commonplace. If these extraordinary events such as increased natural disasters occur at growing rates, people are harmed and humanity suffers.

Events like these lead into vicious cycles because not only does it represent uncontrollable climate change but also accelerated natural selection which increases our reliance upon corporations.

People in this situation are now being forced to shovel funds to plastic processing water companies at an excess rate.

As time goes by, it will become harder and harder to live fairly in a capitalist society.

The Jackson, MS water storm caused a lot of burst pipes and left many Americans with their hands dry and itchy. Looking for an emergency fund, many Americans had to resort to boiling water or buying bottled water at an extreme markup.

According to journalist Sarah Fowler, the scene in the city looks like, “a whole lot of neighbors helping neighbors.” There has not been a determined date for when the city will reach the desired water pressure to fulfill its obligations.

With more and more happenings in our world, it seems as if we must take the good with the bad. Throughout life, it may be true that winning only occurs when the pros outweigh the cons. The question remains, what fuels those in power’s motivations?","For people (mostly Black people) in Jackson, Mississippi, and Flint, Michigan, who are still without clean water, this must feel like the case.

69,8-Mar-21,,Low-Income Areas Hit Hard When Storm Wreaked Havoc On Mississippi,"Low-Income Areas Hit Hard When Storm Wreaked Havoc On Mississippi

Not all of the residents of Jackson, Miss., have had clean water restored — weeks after a winter storm. It's leading to major questions over emergency preparedness, and the state of infrastructure.

SCOTT DETROW, HOST:

This morning, thousands of residents in Jackson, Miss., still do not have access to running water or have to boil what comes out of their tap. It's been nearly three weeks since a winter storm wreaked havoc on Jackson's infrastructure. Areas with mostly Black and low-income residents are still affected. Shalina Chatlani of the Gulf States Newsroom has more.

SHALINA CHATLANI, BYLINE: At Forest Hill High School, senior Deon Sanders pulls a latch on a massive water tank.

DEON SANDERS: When you push this up, water going to come out from right there.

CHATLANI: Sanders is a volunteer at this water drive-through. He says dozens of people have showed up this week, including some of his classmates.

SANDERS: They said their water would cut off. They couldn't flush the toilet or whatever. So they had to come out here and get some water.

CHATLANI: The city of Jackson says that, as of Sunday, there were fewer than 10 water main breaks in the system; less than a thousand residents had no water or little water pressure. The total population is about 160,000. The majority of the city still has boil-water notices. But Charles Williams, city engineer for Jackson, says those should be lifted and other problems solved by the end of this week. He says there are a few next steps.

CHARLES WILLIAMS: Make sure that all of our residents are restored with water, take samples, get our storage tanks filled.

CHATLANI: The areas of Jackson still impacted are predominantly Black and low-income. And some residents say even if their water is on, it comes out dirty. So to get by, people are going to drive-through giveaways and collecting rainwater, staying clean with alcohol wipes or going to a friend's to bathe. And three weeks into this crisis, residents are now dealing with issues that go far beyond the plumbing - for example, Forest Hill High School.

ROCKY KHANNA: Several hundred students were without water.

CHATLANI: Rocky Khanna is a teacher at Forest Hill. He says they were starting to bring students back to the classroom with COVID-19 safety precautions, but during the storm, the school had to close. It still doesn't have water.

KHANNA: And we have to have a certain level of water pressure or water to actually return.

CHATLANI: Khanna says the school has been busing meals to students and making sure they have water. But he's afraid these last few weeks could further slow down students.

KHANNA: Or they may not even have access to the Wi-Fi and Internet.

CHATLANI: Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba says it's important that the city invests in low-income communities, even after the water is turned back on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHOKWE LUMUMBA: What is the poverty rate? What is the quality of education? What is the stability of our infrastructure? Development goals that really should be the metric of success of any economy.

CHATLANI: Lumumba says residents need access to basic resources so they are prepared to weather any storm.

70,1 month ago,The Washington Post,Opinion : My majority-Black city went weeks without potable water. This wouldn’t happen in a Whiter town.,"Many of the state’s White political leaders appear indifferent to the dangers to a largely Black population from a dilapidated water system. Consider the comment by Gov. Tate Reeves, a Republican, in early March, when much of Jackson was still without potable water. He focused instead on problems the city has had with its water billing system. “I do think it’s really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments,” Reeves said, “before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money.”","Many of the state’s White political leaders appear indifferent to the dangers to a largely Black population from a dilapidated water system.

71,2 weeks ago,Mississippi Free Press,Jackson Maddox Well System Repairs Continue,"The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

The TV Road Well is still operating with a temporary pump. In a statement, City of Jackson Communications Director Michelle Atoa explained that a permanent pump for TV Road would be delivered and installed later this week, hopefully bringing an end to the newest manifestation of chronic water problems facing the City of Jackson.

Jackson Maddox Well System provides water to roughly 16,000 connections through six wells. The loss of operations at the two wells in May has caused outages, low water pressure, and undrinkable water for around 2,000 of those connections, located in south Jackson and Byram.

As with most water system outages, the dual well failures have put pressure on higher elevated areas first, without sufficient water output to keep the highest homes pressurized.

“When you have two well systems that are down at the same time, obviously you’re not able to put as much pressure into the system as you’d like,” Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams explained at a press event last week.

A series of setbacks have extended the well failures. Last week’s inclement weather delayed the final pump installation. At the same press event, Williams acknowledged that the City of Jackson had to seek replacement pumps for the two wells out of state.

In spite of the newly installed pump at Siwell Road, the boil-water notice for affected connections remains in effect as the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water in the affected areas: multiple days of clean samples are required before the boil water notice is lifted. Currently, MSDH is testing samples derived from well connections. Atoa told the Mississippi Free Press today that results from the testing are expected in the coming days.

Precautionary boil water notices are not a guarantee of unsafe water, but are required when pressure drops below a certain level. Under-pressurized pipes can draw in groundwater from surrounding pockets near pipe joints and breaks, potentially introducing untreated water into the low-pressure system.

“When we get TV Road back online, we’ll breathe a little easier,” Williams explained to WAPT News, adding that with both wells replaced, “hopefully we’ll end this particular water crisis.”

This particular crisis comes only a few months after a different segment of Jackson’s water utilities faced catastrophe, when many surface water connections tied into the city’s distribution system and water treatment plants spent nearly a month without water pressure. The Jackson water crisis revealed systemic failures to adequately repair and improve the city’s aging water infrastructure, spurred by decades of population loss and disinvestment.

The ongoing well-pump failures represent the second time in a year—the first in September 2020—that the Jackson Maddox Well System has experienced significant outages. In last week’s press event, Williams suggested that improper repair during that first outage contributed to the problems continuing into 2021, but promised that additional care had been taken to ensure that this set of repairs would last.","The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

74,7-Apr-21,WLBT,EPA sent Jackson emergency administrative order on water system,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - There are alarming new details about the condition of Jackson’s water treatment system.

We’ve learned that over a year ago, the Environmental Protection Agency sent an emergency administrative order demanding the city fix the water system or face hefty fines.

Documents show this emergency administrative order was sent to the city last March. We’ve heard city officials talk about the EPA inspecting the water treatment plants and this report details what they found.

The EPA report was critical saying Jackson’s water treatment plants were being mismanaged, had routine equipment failures, vital positions to monitor water treatment were not staffed which could lead to water contamination.

The report also said that plant conditions present imminent and substantial endangerment to the people served by the system.

It also said that turbidity disinfection treatment concerns condition of the system has potential for presence of e.coli in the water. City council members, who just learned about the report a year after it was sent to the city, were alarmed.

Councilman Kenneth Stokes said that with all the problems the city’s having with the water system, it may be better to have someone else manage it.

Stokes said, “If the city cannot run it properly and we’re going to experience these water problems every winter where people are going weeks and months without water, then we need to do something different. If something different means we need to get private companies in here to run our water plant, then so be it.”

The city is making nearly $5 million in repairs at both of their water treatment plants. Some city leaders now wonder if the system failure during the ice storm could have been avoided, if only they knew what the EPA had found.

Councilman Ashby Foote said, “It was a great wake up call for the City of Jackson, ordered by the EPA for the emergency that might lie ahead and sure enough we got hit by that emergency, shut down the water system for weeks in some areas of Jackson. Really disrupted the livelihood and quality of life for our citizens, and the city had been warned about that but the council that had not been warned about it and that’s really disappointing.”

Mayor Lumumba sent a letter to the EPA last year promising to follow their guidelines and make repairs. Members of the council hope to have a healthy discussion about that and why they were kept out of the loop at next weeks council meeting.

75,20-Feb-21,WLBT,Timeline for water reconnection for Jackson residents still unknown,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Several Jackson residents have little to no water pressure.

This is because the city’s water operations were crippled by this week’s winter storm.

At this time, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he can’t give a definitive day or time when the water system will be restored.

However, he said the system is thawing out and making progress.

Wanting to help those in need, city leaders pounded the pavement delivering water to those who’ve been without water for the last couple of days.

A large part of the deliveries were aimed at elderly residents and those who are home-bound.

One of the people on the receiving end is Elease Morgan.

On her 97th birthday, the only gift the birthday girl wanted was a case of water.

Her wish was granted and the bottled waters were personally delivered to her by Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

“It’s a happy moment just to know that you are thought about,” Morgan expressed.

The longtime Jackson resident said she already knows how she’s going to use the water she received.

“Mostly to wash dishes, my hands, and medication,” she said.

“I know what it means not to have water,” said Councilman Stokes. “You can’t flush your toilet, then you talk about no water to drink when you’re thirsty, can’t cook. They need water, and it should be our responsibility to help them.”

Also stepping up to help is Mayor Lumumba.

He and others spent Saturday dropping off cases of water to residents living in assisted living faculties.

“We are getting the water to you, as soon as we can get it ourselves,” said Lumumba.

The mayor said this water is critical, in particular, because he doesn’t know when everyone’s water will be turned back on.

This comes after valves were frozen due to the wintry weather.

“I think that I owe the residents honesty and so I’m gonna always be honest that I cannot give you a precise date and time, but I can say that we are seeing improvements across the city,” the mayor said. “That means that the system is cranking up and pushing more because it is thawing out.”

Lumumba said the water system thawing out is good news, but now they’re bracing themselves for another round of challenges.

“The next challenge that we have to observe is that as they increase the psi, what typically takes place is that you have ruptured in the pipes, and then we’ll have to go out and fix those leaks that will be present and are present at this time,” Lumumba explained. “We haven’t seen them yet because the water hasn’t gotten fully through the lines to reveal them, so as those reveal themselves that will be the next phase of this process. We ask our residents for their patience. We thank them for being patient thus far, and we’re doing all that we can to get the water to them.”

As the city continues to work on its water system, city leaders want to provide water to those who are in need.

If you’re a Jackson resident looking for water, you’re asked to contact your local council member, or dial 311.

In addition to 311 , residents can call one of the following numbers:

77,25-Feb-21,Jackson Free Press,Daggers Drawn: Lumumba and Stokes Trade Blame As City Suffers Water Crisis,"Amid a water crisis in the wake of a serious winter-weather storm, Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba and Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes gave dueling statements during the week, trading accusations of negligence.

""Rookie mistakes of the mayor have proven costly to the city of Jackson, especially children, elderly, disabled and businesses,"" Stokes said Wednesday in an interview with WAPT. ""The issue is senior citizens in this city without water. They couldn't even have water to flush toilets. You wouldn't want that for your mother, any of your loved ones.""

Stokes said that the City's delay in providing tankers to supply water to Jacksonians still without water for over a week was the last straw for him and rejected the mayor's claim that he is spreading misinformation.



The sharp criticisms were in sharp contrast to Stokes’ past endorsement of Lumumba for mayor. Stokes was also close to and endorsed the mayor’s father, a former councilman and activist who died during his first term as mayor.

Lumumba gave a press conference Tuesday in an apparent broadside against Stokes’ earlier comments, defending his administration's effort at providing water for residents. He said what happened is an act of God and rejected the allegation of incompetence against him.

""The crisis that we are in the midst of was an act of God, not through incompetence, not through a failure to act from any individual, not from a failure to act from the administration,"" Lumumba said. ""We offer as proof of the fact that this is an act of God is you just simply have to look at all of the places that this weather affected, and the fact that communities are experiencing the same trauma that our residents are experiencing today—Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas Canton, Mississippi, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Louisiana, and many more.""

Stokes: Tankers ‘Not An Act of God’

Stokes, however, said that ""the issue of tankers is not an act of God,” adding, “Let me say that because they tried to merge the cold weather and ice to tankers. Tankers could have been on the streets in Jackson long before.""

In the Wednesday interview, Stokes picked holes in the mayor's claims. He said that if the city had a white mayor, people would have been marching the streets. He claimed that Lumumba initially rejected renting a tanker because he did not like the business person who has the tanker. He did not mention who this person is. He declined to mention his name after the reporter spoke with him on the phone. The mayor’s communication manager Michelle Atoa said she has no information in response to Stokes' comments.

""This mayor had an opportunity to do something, and he did not,"" Stokes said. ""They had a businessman who had two tankers, (City Council President and Ward 6) Councilman (Aaron) Banks got one of them up, tried to get the city to pay, the mayor said I don't like him."" Banks, however, declined to respond to questions from the Jackson Free Press concerning Stokes' claims.

""So that way the citizens, the older people especially, can't have water to flush their toilet! So Councilman Banks, at that point, was reaching out to get others to pay for it. At that point, the City said they were going to pay for one tanker.”

In his response, the mayor said Stokes does “things just to give the appearance of work.”

Stokes, a long-time member of the Jackson City Council (interrupted by a stint as a Hinds County supervisor) defended himself against the mayor's accusation that he is incompetent by saying that he has introduced more legislation and passed more resolutions than any other council members.

Lumumba: Political Bickering Not Helping

The mayor on Tuesday said all the political bickering is not helping as the city tries to recover from the weather and water crisis.

""I'm calling up to those individuals that we have to work with—our council people. It isn't helpful (that) we're in the midst of a crisis, and we make it a political discussion, or we make it a fight,” Lumumba said.

The mayor said that he has been in communication with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and other agencies for support. He has personally given out 10 pallets of water, he said, adding that his house has also been without water and understands how people feel.

""The failure to have tankers in certain locations was not due to a lack of recognition of the challenge as it was a lack of availability; there were no tankers available to us,"" he said. ""We gave what we had; we gave what we could find.""

Lumumba said that transportation problem caused by the winter storm made it difficult to get their tankers here and that it is very difficult for him to reach the Ward 3 councilman, an allegation Stokes did not deny, saying that he cannot sit and talk with the mayor.

""You do not sit and talk and play with a liar,"" Stokes said and leveled a litany of complaints against the mayor unrelated to the water crisis. The Ward 3 councilman is known for being hard to reach by telephone.

In a statement, Banks said, ""At this time during the crisis of the majority of the city being without water, it is important that we all work together to come to the aid of our citizens.""

78,18-Mar-21,Chattanooga Times Free Press,Chattanooga's faith community mobilizes to help in Mississippi water crisis,"Area churches mobilized in the past week to address the ongoing water crisis in Mississippi, where some residents have gone a month without clean water following a winter storm in February.

Last weekend, Orchard Park Seventh-day Adventist Church hosted a drive on its church campus for people to drop off water donations. The church in Orchard Knob partnered with First Baptist Church and Southern Adventist University to deliver water to communities nearly 400 miles away.

Troy Brand, senior pastor at Orchard Park, said he was shocked with the level of generosity and support from the community.

""What we thought would be one truck full of water, what we thought would be a nice deed, became three U-Haul trucks,"" he said.

Residents of Jackson, Mississippi, were advised to boil their water before consumption after a series of winter storms in February damaged local water infrastructure. For weeks, some residents did not have running water at all, according to the Associated Press.

Brand said notice about the donation campaign was sent through the Kingdom Partners network in Chattanooga last week.

At the same time, Southern Adventist University put a notice out to its campus to collect donations as part of the effort, said Stephanie Guster, senior advisor for diversity to the president. Someone from campus volunteered to drive the truck to Mississippi, she said.

Guster said Christians are called to care for those in need and this was a great opportunity to live out the lessons of the Bible.

""The gospel mandate, 'Go ye into all the world,' there's no geographic or demographic limit on that, even if it's two states away,"" she said. ""Christ's calling is to help everyone in need.""

Brand said he was reminded of the people and donations that came to Chattanooga last April when the region was rocked by a series of tornadoes that left nine people dead and caused millions of dollars of damage to homes and businesses.

""People just helped us out here in Chattanooga. It becomes reciprocal, especially when you know something is going to be lasting a long time. I think it was critical to give them some help,"" Brand said.

On Sunday morning, Brand rode down to Mississippi to drop off the donations. People were already lining up to get water, he said. The Chattanooga area, he estimated, delivered around a dozen pallets of water to Mississippi.

79,13-Apr-21,WLBT,Mayor says EPA order not about water quality; a copy of the order seems to say different,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said Jackson water quality is not unsafe, and that an EPA order is more “a discussion over process than it is over quality of water.”

Tuesday, Jackson leaders discussed an emergency administrative order handed down by the Environmental Protection Agency regarding the city’s public water system.

Lumumba refused to go into details during the open session but said Jackson’s water quality has never been in question.

“I would say this is more a discussion over process than it is over quality of water,” he said. “It would be not only a failure of the city of Jackson, (but) it would be a failure of the Mississippi State Department of Health … for us to OK bad water for the residents of Jackson.”

A copy of the March 2020 Emergency Administrative Order from the EPA, though, seems to say different.

The order, as well as correspondence associated with the order, was sent to the mayor on March 27, 2020, by EPA Region Four.

In it, the agency states that “conditions exist at the system that present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the persons served by the system.”

Federal officials conducted inspections at the O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell water treatment plants, at the behest of the state health department.

The order goes on to state that the EPA identified numerous concerns related to “bacterial contamination and proper disinfection.”

EPA did an inspection of the city’s water treatment plants in February 2020, after the city failed to provide the proper reports to the agency for nearly three years.

Among findings, EPA determined that equipment at both plants was not properly calibrated to “provide accurate dosing for proper treatment of drinking water.” In other words, the city could not determine whether it was putting the accurate amount of chemicals in the water being treated.

Inspectors also found that monitoring equipment at O.B. Curtis had not been repaired or calibrated in three years after a technician position at the plant had been vacated. Respondents also were unable to perform membrane integrity tests and had failed to perform filter maintenance at both plants.

Curtis provides water to more than 43,000 connections across the city. It treats water brought in from the Ross Barnett Reservoir.

Meanwhile, jar tests, which are used to check things like the amount of sedimentation in treated water, were not up to industry standards.

As for water quality itself, turbidity exceedances had been reported at both plants in January 2020.

Turbidity, or the cloudiness of the water, is a good indicator of whether disease-causing organisms are present.

“Particles of turbidity provide shelter for microbes and reduce the microbes’ exposure to disinfectants,” the EPA states. “if particulate material is not removed, a high turbidity event can provide shelter for and promote regrowth of pathogens in the water, leading to an outbreak of waterborne diseases.”

Samples taken on Feb. 23, 2021, at the height of the city’s water crisis, showed samples had turbidity levels of greater than 1.0 turbidity units, much higher than the industry standard of 0.3 turbidity units the city said at the time.

Following that sampling, the city told residents not to drink the water without boiling it.

Inspectors found other problems, as well, including UV disinfection devices that were “offline for significant periods of time” at both water treatment plants, with one at the Fewell plant being offline for 3.5 months. Eight other UV reactors were offline anywhere from two to 31 days, the report stated.

“Despite actions taken by MSDH, the local authorities have not undertaken all actions necessary to protect the public health, and conditions exist at the system that may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons served by the system,” the report states.

Pumps at the O.B. Curtis malfunctioned following the winter storm, contributing to the city's water crisis. (WLBT)

Lumumba said the council needed to go into executive session to discuss the matter, arguing that the administration was still in talks with the EPA regarding compliance.

He further claimed the city had not shared more details of the EPA’s findings, saying a final order from the federal agency had not been handed down.

“The reason we haven’t sent (it) out is because the draft hasn’t been finalized by any party. When there is a completed document that both the EPA and the city of Jackson agree to, it will be issued,” he said. “It would be premature to do it prior to that.”

Ward One Councilman Ashby Foote attempted to challenge the mayor on claims that the order was still in draft form, but was shut down by Council President Aaron Banks, who also said the matter needed to be discussed in a closed session.

Foote said the administration was in talks with EPA over a potential consent decree regarding its water treatment plants. However, those negotiations were separate from the 2020 administrative order.

“He’s trying to cover up the fact they didn’t tell anyone about this,” he said.

The councilman also asked why the mayor was unwilling to discuss the EPA’s findings in an open forum, saying that it was bad optics for city government.

The mayor has been criticized for not informing residents about the EPA order, despite it being handed down more than a year ago.

“One of the biggest problems with this issue is the fact that there was no public announcement when it happened in March 2020. I didn’t find out about it until a week ago,” Foote said.

Documents obtained by WLBT through an open record request bring into question the mayor’s claims Tuesday that the order issued by the EPA was a draft document.

In the March 27, 2020 correspondence to Lumumba, the EPA states that the order “constitutes a final agency action” under the Safe Water Drinking Act. However, it goes on to state that the city could seek federal review.

EPA letter saying the March 2020 order was a ""final agency action"" under the Safe Drinking Water Act. (WLBT)

And in an April 1, 2020 letter the mayor sent to the agency, Lumumba seems to understand that fact.

“The city will use its best efforts to rectify the deficiencies identified in the Emergency Administrative Order. I acknowledge the gravity of this situation and the responsibility to ensure a safe supply of drinking water to the public.”

In that document, Lumumba went on to say that the city “looks forward to working with the EPA and the Mississippi State Department of Health to achieve compliance with this … Order as quickly as practicable.”

Mississippi Moral Monday! 🚨WATCH Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II joins the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign for Moral Monday live from Jackson, MS with a major national announcement of the Mass Poor People’s and Low Wage Workers’ Assembly and Moral March on Washington! ***To see StreamText captions: www.bit.ly/PPC_2021 Posted by Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival on Monday, April 19, 2021

The Poor People's Campaign announced its second virtual Mass Poor People’s and Low-Wage Workers’ Assembly — set for June 21 — on Monday during a stop in Mississippi.

Officials also announced an in-person event, Moral March on Washington, in 2022.

The campaign strives to challenge policy disproportionately affecting the nation's poor and low-income people.

People came together at Smith Park in Jackson to discuss the impact of the state's health care disparities, the pandemic, a monthlong water crisis, racism and centuries of voter suppression in Mississippi.

""It's time for a new day in Mississippi,"" Bishop Thomas Jenkins of Jackson said during an opening prayer. ""Our people have suffered too long.""

Two residents shared their stories of past incarceration that led to their disenfranchisement. Benny Ivey of Jackson spent 11 years in prison on drug charges. Now, Ivey is over a decade into recovery. He has a family and mentors troubled teen. But Ivey still can't vote.

""What more do I have to do?"" Ivey asked. ""Our word don't mean nothing.""

Other residents discussed the impact of violence, poverty and discrimination in the state.

The issues of 2021 are the same as the 1960s and 1970s, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. The worst form of violence is poverty, he told organizers and eventgoers.

The Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, Poor People’s Campaign co-chair, pointed to five interlocking injustices that affect both Mississippians and the nation. The campaign strives to address the following injustices: systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism and a distorted moral narrative of religious nationalism

Residents in Mississippi are one slice of the 140 million low-income and poor people in the United States, according to the campaign's website.

Mississippi joins 44 states in the campaign's organizing efforts to address the five interlocking injustices. Last year, over two million people attended a Poor People's Campaign virtual nationwide rally that placed inequality at the forefront of lawmakers' minds, Barber said.

""It's time for poor and low-wage people to flex our power,"" Barber said. ""If you lift from the bottom, then everybody rises.""

81,1 month ago,WLBT,"Siwell Road well could be back online by Friday, best-case scenario","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Another 1,000 customers on the city of Jackson’s water well system will soon be under a boil water notice, said Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams.

The city gave an update on its efforts to repair the two wells that failed Tuesday morning, leaving thousands of customers again with little or no water pressure.

Williams said that best-case scenario, the larger well will go online again Friday, with crews turning their attention to the other well next week.

Meanwhile, some 16,000 customers in South Jackson and Byram are currently under boil water and conserve water notices.

To help those customers until service is restored, the city already has at least one water giveaway scheduled. That will be held at 4 p.m. Tuesday at Siwell Road Middle School. The school is located at 1983 N. Siwell Rd.

Tuesday morning, the city announced that two wells, including one at Siwell Road and one at TV Road in South Jackson had gone down, leaving just four in operation.

Williams said crews are now concentrating on repairing the wells and will focus first on the one at Siwell Road.

“We are basically assessing the situation while the contractor is on-site and are breaking down the well to determine the cause of that failure,” Williams said. “We hope to have some information available tomorrow.”

Williams said it will likely be “well into next week” before crews will know the severity of the TV Road well failure.

Areas affected by the disruptions include the TV Road area, Maddox Road, U.S. Highway 18, Willowood, Cedar Hills, Siwell Road, Terry Road, Spring Ridge Road, and Gary Road.

“We’re asking for your patience. For residents on the well system with water, we’re asking (you) to conserve water over the next two days and into the weekend,” he said. “We have been blessed that the weather has been cool, so there’s not a tremendous strain on the system (like we had when) both wells went down in September 2020.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba also voiced calls for patience, saying that the city is still amid a water crisis.

“Because of our aged infrastructure... until we can comprehensively, effectively address it … we will continue to fight with this system,” he said.

“We know how difficult it is. We know what a challenge and sacrifice it is to go without water for cooking, for bathing, for sanitary purposes,” he added.

The mayor again reiterated the need for federal aid in addressing the city’s water system needs.

“We are looking for an infrastructure package to come from the federal government. We know that Sen. (Roger) Wicker just had a bipartisan meeting with the president, and we are tuned into the results of such meetings,” he said. “We want all of our U.S. delegation to know Jackson is paying heavy attention to the work taking place there.”

He also provided an update on efforts to improve service in South Jackson.

“We’re investing, two meetings ago, (the council voted) to pay for a $7 million pipe that will better improve pressure to South Jackson.”

South Jackson is located farthest away from the city’s main water treatment plants and typically is hit hardest when there are disruptions in service and water pressure in the system drops.

Following severe winter storms in February, some customers in the Forest Hills area, for instance, experienced little or no water pressure for several weeks.

When a winter storm knocked out water service to tens of thousands of Mississippi residents, it was Black families that were hit hardest—and who organized their own relief efforts. Why you can trust us By Aallyah Wright 7 MIN READ

For Rukia Lumumba, this time was different.

In February 2021, a winter weather warning prompted the native of Jackson, Mississippi, to take precautions, just as she had two years ago when another winter storm hit her hometown. She adjusted the thermostats in her home, filled her bathtub with water, and left the water faucets dripping so the pipes wouldn’t freeze, she said.

The next morning, Lumumba could get only a trickle of water from her faucets. Days went by, and her water did not return.

“This storm lasted four to five days,” she said. “The ice was so thick. The conditions were so different.” Ice covered the roads for days, she said, and stores like Walmart sold out of cases of bottled water.

The back-to-back winter storms in February left about 43,000 homes without access to running water for nearly a month. The cold temperatures caused water plant equipment to freeze and centuries-old water pipes to break, city officials say, which will take more than $2 billion to fix. The water pressure dropped, the system shut down, and service interruptions were disproportionately felt in communities farthest from the city’s water sources, especially in West and South Jackson, areas whose populations are largely Black.

In the time of crisis, grassroots organizing helped the community secure essential needs where the local and state governments came up short. Lumumba, the executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, received several text messages and phone calls alerting her of others without water. The Jackson-based nonprofit describes itself as a community resource, capacity-building incubator and training ground for transformative justice in the South. Lumumba immediately began to organize from her home, calling folks she knew throughout the state who could help distribute water, blankets, and other essential items, she said.

“Literally, just after the storm, we hit the ground running, even with ice on the ground,” she said. “We began to safely distribute things for people, and it was a very dangerous job. There were times I myself felt that I wasn’t gonna make it.”

The roads topped with ice and store closures made it nearly impossible to reach the community.

The city of Jackson operates two water treatment plants, some of whose pipes date back to the 1900s. The Ross Barnett Reservoir and the Pearl River serve as sources for the water utilities, said Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams at a March 19 virtual town hall.

It isn’t uncommon for residents to experience unsafe drinking water, and boil water notices are common, a city spokesperson said, but frequency of notices varies, depending on the situation. Jackson’s Public Works director told WLBT-TV that, for example, the city experienced nearly 500 main breaks in 2010, and almost 300 more in 2018. High levels of lead were found in the city’s water supply in 2016.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said during the town hall that he has asked for years for federal and state funding to alleviate the city’s infrastructure needs. The mayor, who is Rukia Lumumba’s brother, presented two options for state lawmakers to consider: Support a bill that allows the city to raise its sales tax by 1 cent to raise $14 million per year to fund repairs, or directly allocate $47 million in emergency relief for repairs to the water treatment facilities. The sales tax bill died without committee consideration, and instead lawmakers approved just $3 million to overhaul one of the water plants, saying the city could draw on the federal American Rescue Act for more infrastructure work.

The hurdles of improving a faulty water billing system, the city’s declining tax base, and low revenues mean Jackson cannot afford to make repairs, Mayor Lumumba said.

Antiquated infrastructure issues aren’t new in older cities. In the city of Mound Bayou, situated in the Mississippi Delta, for example, the water lines were installed before the 1970s, said Mayor Eulah Peterson. At some point, “everything wears out,” she said.

“You try to add on to systems that need to be fixed, then you got a situation where a major replacement is needed,” Peterson said. “We’re probably all experiencing what Jackson is experiencing, but it’s not as large.”

Tamiko Smith, a resident of South Jackson, grew worried when her water and power did not return on the second day after the storm. She couldn’t wash, cook, bathe, or flush her toilet. Most importantly, she said, she couldn’t help her husband, Otis, with his at-home dialysis treatments. Staying at home would intensify her husband’s health risks because water and electricity is necessary for his solution bag, she added. The couple had no choice but to check in to a hotel.

“Dialysis is a life-threatening thing,” Smith said. “You can’t go three or four days. It’s not good for a person because you could become septic if you don’t get your treatment.”

Once the power was turned back on three days later, the Smiths returned home. But they still had no water. Tamiko drove 15 minutes every day to her daughter’s house to fill and refill a water cooler until their water service at home was restored. This became a daunting task—filling gallon jugs with water, hauling it to the trunk of her SUV, then toting it into her house. Her water service finally returned two weeks later, she said.

Smith critiqued Gov. Tate Reeves’ slow response to summon help from the National Guard, emphasizing the additional barriers this placed on the elderly community, nursing homes, and long-term care facilities.

“When we were dealing with having no water, our governor was talking about removing the mask mandate. There are quite a few dialysis patients in (South Jackson),” she said.

Arekia Bennett, the director of Mississippi Votes, a millennial-led civic engagement organization, and a South Jackson resident, said what her family and others experienced is systemic racism. Frustration settled in for Bennett when her parents drove to North Jackson—where in some neighborhoods more than 80% of the population is White—to her brother’s house to take a shower. It became evident that there was a financial disinvestment in predominantly Black areas, Bennett said.

“If I’m in areas like Fondren (in North Jackson), and I drive 10 minutes back to South Jackson, you can literally see the changes in infrastructure. You can see the changes in dilapidated buildings and houses,” she said. “You can see the intentional redlining, clear disenfranchisement of people and their livelihoods.”

Bennett said that even the location of the Ross Barnett Reservoir showed the racism embedded in the city infrastructure. The reservoir and its treatment plant lie northeast of Jackson—closest to the White neighborhoods of the city—and the water system’s failure after the storm was felt hardest in the more distant Black neighborhoods.

Bennett and her parents finally got their water service restored three weeks after the storm hit. That moment took her back to 2015 when she spoke on a panel about “climate change being a real thing.” The lack of preparedness by Mississippi’s elected officials is unacceptable and officials must be held accountable, she said.

“People’s lives are not this political chess game,” she said. “We cannot afford to not be prepared for the real implications of not being prepared and what it could do and cause for folks who live literally worlds apart from the other side of Jackson.”

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, also helped people after the storm, such as moms who needed formula and groceries or laundry services, she said. She agreed with Bennett that it is incumbent on elected officials to be prepared because low-income families, for instance, do not have enough money or job security to prepare for a disaster.

“This is a human right,” she added. “(Lawmakers) have to really pass smart policies that ensure families can take care of themselves in a disaster.”

This is why organizers in the community like Welchlin and Rukia Lumumba stepped in.

Rukia Lumumba said it was in part to “save ourselves” from “willful and intentional neglect by the state to care for the needs of Jackson.” The People’s Advocacy Institute delivered water and food boxes to more than 15,000 homes and housed over 100 people in hotels. Also, her organization conducted wellness calls to thousands of residents, which allowed them to provide more relief. The nonprofit organization also raised more than $20,000 to give out in direct payments for residents to pay utility bills and for other needs.

Lumumba said that while the organization was conducting wellness checks, they learned that a lot of people had also lost their food stamps, food subsidies, or other benefits, and they were hearing that the state had not renewed some of those programs for those residents.

Many of those people were living on fixed incomes, she said. “That was a really big problem.”

While it’s still unclear when Jackson will have enough resources to overhaul its water system, one option the city council is considering would be to work with the Rural Water Emergency Assistance Cooperative, which creates partnerships between municipalities and water utilities to provide technical assistance, physical assistance, and mutual aid in times of need. That would bring in more volunteers and personnel in response to extreme weather events.

In the interim, on-the-ground organizers will continue to pressure lawmakers, while continuing to prioritize the well-being of the community.

“Our community really came together. We can’t wait on the government to meet our immediate needs,” Welchlin said. “We’ve been talking about how to make sure that our community has stockpiles ready for when disasters happen, so we won’t be in this kind of situation again.”

A City Council member in Jackson, Mississippi, said Monday that it’s time for the city to seek state and federal help.

“This is an institutional failure,” said De’Keither Stamps, who is also a state representative. He said he spent about $5,000 to install a tank on his truck so could distribute water to homebound residents.

Stamps told The Associated Press that he visited a 70-year-old woman last week without heat or water who hadn’t left her bed in two days.

“This really broke the backs of a lot of communities,” he said of the storm. “We need door-to-door check-ins with our elderly.”

Jackson is under boil-water advisory, and city workers are delivering drinking water to older and homebound residents. Water for flushing toilets was available for pickup at two local schools, and people waited in long lines Monday to fill buckets and bowls.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency has supplied 131,000 bottles of water to people statewide and is working to determine if the state has met its $4.5 million damages threshold to request a federal disaster declaration.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he has had trouble reaching Gov. Tate Reeves. The Democratic mayor said he has tried calling the Republican governor’s personal number without getting a response. Lumumba said he usually communicates with Reeves’ chief of staff, who left the state for a family emergency.

Reeves spokeswoman Bailey Martin said the governor has no unanswered calls from the mayor.

“This is false,” Martin said. “The governor has been leading the state’s response to this crisis, and he was the one who directed that water be delivered to Jackson residents via his agency, MEMA. We have been in consistent contact with the mayor’s office and other local leaders.”

On Monday, Jackson’s Public Works Director Charles Williams said it could be the end of the week before water returns for all 161,000 residents as crews scramble to repair broken pipes.

“We are doing everything we can to get it hopefully quicker than that,” Williams said.

Williams said the water shortage occurred after frigid temperatures iced equipment and caused water lines to burst. Officials say the city’s aging water system is not built for subfreezing temperatures.

Jackson has struggled to find money for improvements.

Mississippi has a 7% sales tax on many items. With permission of the Legislature, Jackson had a local election in January 2014 to add an extra 1% sales tax in the city to improve or replace aging infrastructure, including streets riddled with pot holes and pipes that are decades old and have a history of breaking after cold weather.

Voters overwhelmingly approved the tax, which was projected to generate about $15 million a year. That is only a fraction of what is needed, though. Jackson officials said in 2014 that fixing all the city’s infrastructure problems would cost about $2 billion.

Sheila Lewis, a parent of a 19-year-old student at Jackson State University, said her son has been without water for six days on campus. The campus has been shut down during the crisis.

“We just didn’t expect the university to be out for so long,” said Lewis, who lives in a Houston suburb.

Louisiana has faced similar challenges. About 82,000 people in Louisiana lacked access to water by Monday, according to the state health department, and hundreds of thousands of people around the state were advised to boil their water before using it.

In Shreveport, Louisiana’s third-largest city, about 8,000 residential and business customers still waited for their water connection to return, according to Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins. He said Louisiana’s difficulties from the winter weather have been lost amid the problems in Texas.

“Everybody’s eyes are on Texas,” Perkins said in an interview Monday. “Nobody even knows what’s going on here. They don’t even know the damage.”

He added: “Louisiana has been treated very much like a stepchild in this crisis.”

Perkins estimated full water restoration would be complete in his northwestern Louisiana city by Tuesday, a full eight days after outages began.

But even that won’t end the water woes in Shreveport. Perkins said once water is completely restored, customers will remain under a boil advisory until Thursday or Friday, because testing will need to be completed ensuring water is safe to drink. Meanwhile, water has been trucked to hospitals and distributed to residents.

“We’ve even had our fire trucks go out and pump water into the hospitals,” Perkins said.

Families running low on supplies have found Shreveport area grocery store shelves stripped of items, with delivery trucks unable to reach the region until roads cleared.

“It’s still rough on a lot of families,” Perkins said. “Just about every grocery store in the city doesn’t have milk, water, bread, any of those types of essentials.”

More than 15,000 customers remained without power Monday in Mississippi, according to PowerOutage.us, which trackers outages nationwide. Most of the outages were in the central and southwest parts of the state.

In Louisiana, fewer than 4,000 customers remained without power.

(CNN) The historic winter storm that crippled Texas during the third week of February spotlighted the Lone Star State's pervasive history of structural racism. Similarly, it revealed how seemingly universal crises, such as climate change and catastrophes sometimes referred to as ""acts of God"" affect some communities much more severely than others.

During the height of this record winter storm, 4 million Texans lost power, but those who lived on grids that connected hospitals, emergency responders, or downtown commercial buildings and condos were more likely to retain their power. Wealth, income and housing inequality make it much more likely for Black and Latinx families in Texas to live away from densely populated and more expensive parts of the city -- and when they do live in urban areas, to reside in places that are not deemed essential to the functioning of the electrical grid. They are more likely to live in areas lacking the robust infrastructure necessary to weather environmental and man-made catastrophes, environmental experts recently told The New York Times

Black and Latinx families, many already disproportionately impacted by the lingering effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, experienced power outages, burst pipes, freezing temperatures and water shutdowns that illustrate the hidden cost of racism. The storm's aftershocks continue to be felt in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Mississippi where many Black and brown residents continue to lack power, clean drinking water and shelter.

In Texas, almost two weeks after the storm, almost 400,000 people remain without clean water (after power outages halted the ability of municipalities to adequately ensure the safety of water systems, leading to boil water orders in some areas such as Austin), many of them apartment dwellers whose landlords have been slow to respond to the crisis . Some residents of Jackson, Mississippi , a predominantly Black city, have been left reeling from the storm's aftermath and are still struggling to obtain an adequate supply of clean water.

What happened in Texas and across the South during the storm -- and is still happening in its aftermath -- is one facet of a national crisis of race and democracy, one that has been amplified in recent decades by economic and public policies that have greatly enhanced the power and wealth of the few at the expense of the many. Republicans led the charge for the privatization of public utilities and the evisceration of labor unions and social welfare programs during the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s , which impacted Texas by leading to the deregulation of the energy grid . Many Democrats also embraced that era's ""greed is good"" ethos (a phrase popularized by Michael Douglas' Oscar-winning performance as the amoral venture capitalist Gordon Gekko in the 1987 movie ""Wall Street"").

The conservative free-market ideology that led to the deregulation of Texas utilities has been catastrophic on racially segregated and economically impoverished communities. Structured to operate without federal safeguards that might have prevented last month's disaster, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), represents a profound failure of political leadership and moral imagination.

Texas' failure is also reflective of our larger racial and political divides. Members of the Black communities in Houston, some still not recovered from the devastation wrought by Hurricane Harvey, stood in long lines seeking food, water, and other resources a week after the winter storm. Predominantly Black and Latinx low-income communities were especially vulnerable to freezing temperatures since they tend to live in older homes and apartments hit hardest by power outages that wrought havoc on neighborhoods with decaying infrastructure.

The split-screen nature of American democracy means that lying politicians often try to impose an alternate reality in service to their own power. This could be seen at the height of the crisis, with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott attacking the Green New Deal as a rhetorical sleight of hand intended to deflect from his failed leadership. Abbott's false claims that the winter storm ""showed how the Green New Deal would be a deadly deal"" for America reflects the Orwellian nature of American politics. Since less than 13% of the energy grid is powered by wind and solar energy, Abbott's naked effort to deflect blame for the disaster was as laughable as it was appalling. The failure of political leadership and moral imagination of the Texas governor is boundless. From prematurely announcing the end of a statewide mask mandate -- while residents in major cities still struggle to get vaccinated -- to the incompetent approach to a historic winter storm, the Lone Star state has become a national embarrassment.

When states like Texas turn public utilities into financial markets that can exploit the nation's collective resources for private interests, we all lose, especially Black and brown folks.

The reverse migration of Black folks to the South makes this a particularly important policy and political issue. Climate change, like all the challenges facing the nation and world, has a racially disparate face . Communities lacking political and economic resources will in all likelihood consistently suffer the most catastrophic impact of the kind of regional failure we witnessed during the third week in February.

After the Black Lives Matter protests so widespread in 2020 sparked a wave of conversation and engagement with anti-racism, it's crucial to say: Centering racial justice in the fight against climate change is perhaps among the most important policy imperatives in the quest for Black citizenship and dignity.

Sen. Ted Cruz's now-infamous escape to Cancun amid the state's crisis, while Beto O'Rourke and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez raised millions to help those in need, offers a striking juxtaposition of the twin realities of this moment. Cruz's rhetoric helped embolden the White supremacist assault on the nation's capital even as he failed the minimum test of leadership at home by abandoning his constituents in a time of crisis.

AOC's advocacy of a ""Green New Deal"" that would center poor, working-class, Black and brown communities as part of an ambitious effort to reverse climate change, end income inequality and confront systemic racism continues to be wrongly portrayed as a radical anti-American agenda by the right -- even as once in a century storms continue to damage local, regional, and national infrastructure with unnerving frequency.

National discussion surrounding ending systemic racism in government, politics, and corporate America begins by confronting racism's structural impact on already vulnerable communities. Blacks, Latinx, and poor communities of color continue to bear the brunt of environmental and political storms that cast a spotlight on American democracy's tragic underbelly. Now, more than ever, America needs infrastructure and climate change policies that address structural racism and inequality by centering racial and economic justice.","(CNN) The historic winter storm that crippled Texas during the third week of February spotlighted the Lone Star State's pervasive history of structural racism.

86,7-Apr-21,WLBT,Senator says Jackson has to spend money on water system before getting more help from state,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - If Jackson wants the state’s help in repairing its water system, it will have to help itself first, so says District 26 Sen. John Horhn.

During the 2021 session, the city asked lawmakers for more than $100 million to help fund emergency repairs.

The request was made amid the city’s winter water crisis, which left tens of thousands of residents across Jackson without water for weeks.

The request included nearly $47 million to make upgrades at the city’s water treatment plans and $60 million to build additional storage tanks to increase capacity in underserved areas.

That $60 million request was additionally reduced to around $15 million.

However, by the end of the session, neither request had been approved, with the legislature allocating the city just $3 million out of the state’s capital expenditures fund.

Horhn said part of the reason is that Jackson is already set to receive tens of millions of dollars in funding from the American Recovery Plan.

Mississippi state Sen. John Horhn is shaken up but thankful for his life after he was robbed at gunpoint.

It also is going to likely receive millions more in emergency assistance once the state’s request for disaster assistance is approved by the president.

As part of ARP, Jackson is slated to receive $47 million in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) funds.

“The city gave us a $47 million request, yet they’re getting $47 million from HUD,” he said. “They could use the money they’re getting from that to make the repairs.

“Beyond that, what is Hinds County going to dedicate to that effort?”

The county is expected to get another $45 million in ARP funding. District One Supervisor Robert Graham said the board had not decided how it would spend its allocation.

“The first thing we have to do is get it,” he said. “We’ll get half of it (upfront) and the other half will come in 12 months.”

The city and the county are expected to receive the first half of their funding in the next 30 or so days, Horhn said.

Meanwhile, the senator said that as soon as the state’s disaster declaration is approved, Jackson will be able to apply for grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Treasury and other agencies.

The state recently received a time extension to submit its request for a major disaster declaration due to the February 11-19 winter storms. Two storms ripped across the state that month, causing widespread damage, including at Jackson’s O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) initially had until March 21 to submit its request but now has until April 16 to submit the request, according to a MEMA news release.

“There may be between $100 million and $200 million they could access from the federal government with the declaration,” Horhn explained. “It’s important the city aggressively goes after those discretionary funds.”

Also on the federal level, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) has authored legislation that would provide Jackson with at least $72 million in additional federal funds through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program and another $25 million from the federal Economic Development Administration’s Economic Adjustment Assistance grants program.

That bill has been referred to a Senate committee, but no action has been taken.

Jennifer Granholm, D-Mich., to be Secretary of Energy, Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021 on Capitol Hill in Washington. (Graeme Jennings/Pool via AP) (Graeme Jennings | AP)

Horhn was quick to say the state is not closing the door on Jackson but is rather requiring city leaders to pay it forward.

“The feeling in the legislature is, if you’re not trying to help yourself, why should I help you?” he said.

He points to the fact that lawmakers are likely going to set aside a portion of the $1.8 billion in relief funding it is expected to receive from ARP to the city.

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann also said he wanted to use $166 million in capital project funds from the federal government to establish a “support fund for every community affected by the ice storm.”

Horhn said state leaders also felt they had time to address the city’s water crisis, in part, because it will take time for Jackson to expend the initial $47 million it’s receiving.

“Let’s say the city dedicates $30 million of the $47 million to this crisis. And let’s say Hinds County gives another $20 million,” he said. “That’s $50 million to get cranked up.”

Add that to the $3 million from the state, “that’s $53 million the city will have a hard time spending,” Horhn said.

Lawmakers also want to see more details on how the city would use any allocation. He pointed to the fact that the city council asked for $60 million to install new water tanks in south and west Jackson, but then reduced that amount to $15 million.

“What they need to do is put in place a plan of action – what they will spend the money on and when,” Horhn said. “They won’t throw a boatload of money at the city without a plan in place.”

87,25-Feb-21,WLBT,WLBT granted exclusive tour of O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - On Thursday, 3 On Your Side was given an exclusive tour of ground zero for Jackson’s winter water crisis – the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

Public Works Director Charles Williams agreed to the tour to help the public better understand how the recent winter storms caused interruptions in water service for homes and businesses across the city.

The tour came more than a week into the crisis, and as half of the 43,000 customers served by Curtis were still experiencing low or no water pressure.

“We wanted you to get a feel for what it takes to run a water treatment facility. It’s not easy,” Williams said. “It takes a lot of manual resources, as far as personnel. It also takes a lot of equipment to run a plant.

“All of (the equipment) has to be operational at all times to get water to our citizens ... safe water to our citizens.”

Early last week, a winter storm ripped across Mississippi, bringing with it freezing rain, sleet, snow, and sub-freezing temperatures. The weather wreaked havoc on the plant, causing several major pieces of equipment to stop working. A second storm came through in the middle of the week.

The brunt of the wintry weather was felt at the plant’s water intake area.

Curtis is located on a couple of acres located off of Lake Harbour Drive in Ridgeland.

It pumps in water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which is then filtered through large “water screens,” and diverted to a conventional settling tank.

Pumps at the O.B. Curtis malfunctioned following the winter storm, contributing to the city's water crisis. (WLBT)

The storm caused surface water temperatures at the reservoir to fall to 48 degrees. That surface temperature, coupled with the sub-freezing outside temperatures, led to the water screens freezing up, Williams said.

“Those froze and we couldn’t bring water in,” he said. “When the water gets to 48 degrees and the temperature outside is below 32 it’s a bad combination.”

Plant workers discovered the problem the Saturday following the storms.

“We got the screens back working and then we had an issue with the raw water pumps,” he said.

Raw water pumps bring in water directly from the reservoir, which is then filtered through the water screens and sent to the 10-million-gallon-capacity conventional basin, where it is allowed to settle.

From there, the water is chemically treated before being sent out into the city’s water distribution system.

Water is allowed to settle at the Curtis plant's coventional basin, before it is chemically treated. (WLBT)

The conventional method is one of two ways the plant treats water.

In addition to the conventional method, it also treats water through a membrane system, where raw water is brought in from the reservoir, diverted past the conventional basin, and pushed through membrane filters.

Public Works Director Charles Williams expands the Curtis plant's membrane filtration unit. (WLBT)

Curtis was constructed in the late 1980′s or early 1990′s and was expanded in 1997, Williams said. Today, it has the capacity to treat about 50 million gallons of water a day.

During the height of the crisis, water production at the facility fell to about 20 million gallons a day.

With the drop in production, pressure in the distribution system fell off. As a result, customers across the city lost water pressure. Pressure at Curtis must stay at around 90 pounds per square inch to ensure that water is pushed out throughout the city’s distribution system.

As of Thursday night, PSI at Curtis was still between 78 and 80, Williams said.

Treatment efforts were also hampered because two ultraviolet filters had gone down prior to the storm. Contractors were unable to come out and make repairs because of icy conditions.

“We were able to get them fixed internally,” he said. “That limited our ability to get water out.”

As the city addresses problems at the plant, it also is turning its attention to water main breaks.

As the pressure in the system is restored, the city expects water lines in the distribution system to rupture, something that could cause PSI again to drop.

Public works also will be looking at what, if anything, could have been done differently to prevent the crisis.

“That is something we’re going to have to evaluate,” he said. “Once we get everything restored, we need to lay everything on the table and have a thorough discussion about this particular event, what we learned from it, everything that went wrong, and what are some strategies we can put in place to prevent it from at least minimally happening again.”

When the cold temperatures arrived, it knocked the PSI measurement of water going through the plants to 37. The PSI is usually between 80 and 90 in order to properly supply the City of Jackson.

As of Sunday, it is up to 58 psi. That is up from 55 psi Saturday, 51 psi Friday and 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

There are now 20 confirmed water main breaks within the city and they are continuing to work to assess and coordinate repairs.

On Friday, Dr. Williams urged neighbors to be patient. He doesn’t have a specific timeline of when the water pressure will return to normal. He pointed out there’s a lot the city can learn from this experience and said studies need to be done to see how the city can react better to these conditions.

“I think there’s always room for improvement, and we’re going to need to take a look at this particularly event and also talk to other municipalities.

Jackson is getting millions of dollars from the state to help fix its water system. After a lot of debate, the Mississippi Legislature approved $3 million, much less than the $47 million the mayor wanted.February’s water crisis crippled one of Jackson’s water treatment plants and left much of the city without running water for a month. After that unprecedented infrastructure failure, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba sent a letter to state and federal leaders asking for $47 million to pay for overdue repairs. The Republican-controlled legislature approved only $3 million to pay for repairs to the Fewell Water Plant at the Waterworks curve on I-55.“The $3 million that we received (Thursday) is nowhere near what we want, but it’s a start. Three-million-dollars is better than $0,” said State Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson.None of that money can be spent on the O.B. Curtis plant, which was a source of the initial water system shut down.“They came with a lot of rounded numbers, like, ‘We need $1 million. We need $2 million.’ So, we gave them $3 million to fix up the water plant, or at least get started on that,” said Lt. Gov.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is walking back statements he made alleging state-owned properties in Jackson were not paying for water.

Lumumba made the comments to the New York Times and in at least one press conference locally amid the city's water crisis in an apparent effort to show the city doesn't receive its fair share of revenue from the state.

Lumumba said he sent a retraction to the Times after an unnamed official in his administration pointed out the error. The correction came about a week after the March 12 article was published, according to the Times.

Lumumba first told the paper the city “provides water for the state of Mississippi, but we don’t get paid for the water we provide to them. If we simply charged the state like any other customer, we’d be in a lot better position.”

When asked to clarify on Monday, the mayor's office released a statement.

“It has come to my attention that I have misspoken with regard to the state of Mississippi paying for water within the city of Jackson,” Lumumba said. “The state does in fact pay for its water. I stand corrected.”

Water billing plan: Plan to overhaul Jackson's water billing system two months away, consultant says

The correction comes after reports surfaced that showed state-owned properties were indeed paying their water bills and have been for years.

Jackson Jambalaya first broke the news and revealed through public record requests that several properties — including the Capitol Complex, Department of Agriculture & Commerce, PERS, and the Health Department — have paid several hundred thousand dollars in water bills in just this fiscal year alone.

The comments have generated their own controversy between the mayor and Gov. Tate Reeves. When asked Monday, Reeves blasted the mayor for the claims.

""Either that was a complete lie or he was informed wrong about what the state pays,"" Reeves said. ""My understanding is the state has spent well in excess of half a million dollars on water alone.""

Reeves also pointed to the city's issues with its water billing system, where thousands of water customers still do not receive a bill. That has resulted in a shortfall of millions of dollars of revenue every year for the city.

The Clarion Ledger has also submitted public records requests for billing information from state-owned properties. It is also examining whether those properties pay property taxes. Lumumba — in his correction — said the state does not pay taxes nor a payment in lieu of taxes. It also does not pay for police and fire services, he said.

The correction comes as Lumumba and other city officials are attempting to secure $47 million in funding from the state to help repair its deficient infrastructure. Consecutive days of freezing temperatures led to a historic shutdown of the water's treatment plants, leading to widespread water shortages and outages, and resulting in a citywide boil-water notice that lasted close to a month.

""That's one of the unfortunate things when we find ourselves in what we all agree is a crisis with Jackson's water system,"" Reeves continued. ""There are enough challenges out there where we all need to work together that nobody needs to go out there and lie and make it seem worse than it really is.""

A consultant with the city said it will take about two months before a comprehensive plan to overhaul Jackson's troubled water billing system will be ready for review.

Mike Secor updated council members on Monday of progress analyzing Jackson's water and sewer billing system, as well as a look at reorganizing the city's Water/Sewer Business Administration.

He said a final report on both will be ready in approximately eight weeks.

The plan will encompass Jackson's longstanding issues with getting water bills out to customers or reliably trusting its water meter system.

It also comes as a backdrop to the city's worst water infrastructure crisis in recent memory, which has put Jackson's water woes back in public view.

""People want to know what the city is doing to stabilize its water system,"" Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay said after the meeting. ""Finally, there's some end in sight.""

One of the problems with the current system is that the city’s meters do not transmit information in a reliable manner, meaning water meter usage is difficult to track.

The new system would have automated meters that can collect and store water billing information remotely. It will also allow customers to review and pay their bill via cellphone, as well as start or transfer service online.

For years, Jackson has lost out on millions in dollars of revenue from water collections due to widespread billing issues. The city should see about $7 million a month in water revenue, said Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay. Instead, it collects about half that.

""And that's been the case for years,"" Lindsay said.

The plan announcement comes almost 10 years after the city signed its $89 million contract with Siemens Industry Inc. and several Jackson subcontractors to overhaul the billing system. That contract guaranteed savings but resulted in widespread issues with the system that persist.

It was revealed in 2018 that nearly one-third of all water customers weren't getting a bill.

100,22-Mar-21,,"One Month Later, Boil Water Advisory Lifted for Jackson, Mississippi Residents","After 30 days of boiling their water to get rid of contaminants and sometimes no water at all, Jackson residents are finally able to drink the water from the tap after officials lifted a boil water advisory put in place in mid-February when a deep freeze wreaked havoc on their water infrastructure.

The city’s 43,000 surface water connections were released Wednesday from the boil advisory put in place on Feb. 16. A boil notice had previously been lifted for the city’s 16,000 well water connections on March 10.

After officials said cold weather froze equipment at the city’s water treatment plant, thousands of water customers went weeks with low pressure or no pressure at all, collecting water in buckets from distribution sites throughout the city to flush toilets and clean themselves. National Guard members were called in to help distribute water. Volunteers loaded tanks of water on trucks to deliver to apartment complexes housing seniors and those without transportation.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said the crisis has been caused in part by decades of neglect of aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson’s water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor affecting the city’s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base because of “white flight.” Jackson’s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize the water system and other infrastructure related to sewer and roads.

The Democratic mayor wrote a letter to Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and other officials to request $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system. Since then, the mayor and other city leaders have begun meeting with legislative leaders to discuss options.

103,13-Mar-21,WLBT,Congressman Thompson offers solutions to help with Jackson’s water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson has been facing a water crisis for nearly a month, but U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson said there are some solutions to help the city bounce back.

He said there’s a short term solution.

“Short term, FEMA,” said Thompson. “Now that we have the paperwork submitted requesting that disaster declaration, I anticipate in very short order that President Biden will make that disaster declaration available for Hinds County and 32 other counties that the request has gone in.”

Then there’s a long term solution.

In the next few weeks, lawmakers in Washington will be voting on an infrastructure package.

“In those packages, will be additional monies for communities like Jackson, to improve water, sewer, as well as streets and other infrastructure challenges that they might have,” said Thompson.

The longtime lawmaker said the state and Capital City will also receive relief funds from the American Rescue Plan to help them recover.

Also included in the $1.9 trillion stimulus relief package is money to provide access to the COVID-19 vaccine, especially for African-Americans throughout the state.

The congressman said many people have raised concerns about not having transportation to get the shot, or their city doesn’t have sites available.

Now, he’s hoping that will change.

“This money that we put in the COVID relief package will pay 100 percent of the cost of doing anything as it relates to COVID,” the lawmaker explained. “If you have to hire buses to take people to get a shot, we’ll reimburse them. If you have to have five sites in an area, if those sites are providing shots for individuals, we’ll pay for the cost. There’s no excuse now for states or municipalities not to have sites available.”

Though he’s happy about the American Rescue Plan being passed and signed, Thompson said there’s one issue that still lingers regarding that legislation.

“I was just kind of bothered that no other member of our delegation voted for it,” he expressed.

Still, Thompson said he believes the plan will bring some much needed relief to many cities in the state who are struggling.

“I just thought anytime people can alleviate the pain and suffering in your community then that’s a good thing,” said Thompson. “That’s what America’s all about, helping people in their time of need.”

106,3-Mar-21,WLBT,Jackson restaurant owner asking for help as locations suffer from lack of water,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - One of Jackson’s biggest cheerleaders is taking a rare stance, asking people to help his business in light of the city’s water crisis.

The news comes even as an anonymous patron makes a $10,000 purchase in gift cards from the establishments.

Jeff Good, co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, outlined his restaurant’s struggles on Facebook Wednesday morning.

“This is day 15 of no water at Broad Street Bakery & Cafe ... We have been working directly with the city of Jackson ... they are doing all they can but this was truly a catastrophic failure of equipment and the recovery period will drag out until the entire web of water lines and water towers (is) repressurized,” he wrote.

Another one of his restaurants, Sal & Mookie’s New York Pizza and Ice Cream Joint, on Taylor Street, opened on a limited basis earlier this week after being closed for more than 10 days with no water.

Good said he had avoided asking for help until now, saying that in light of the circumstances, “perhaps it is time to just go ahead and surrender and say ‘your help would be wonderful.’”

Meanwhile, Good is asking patrons to come back to his restaurants when they do reopen.

“We know your patterns of breakfast eating, coffee and pastry pick up, lunch ordering, afternoon snacking and dinner pick up have changed since we shuttered,” he wrote. “Habits are formed over time, through repetition and consistency. I fear that some of you may be building a new dining habit since we are not available.

“Please, please return. When we reopen, we will need you more than ever.”

Not all the news is bad for Good, though, with the restaurateur taking time on social media to thank a patron who purchased $10,000 in gift cards at Bravo! Italian Restaurant, his third Jackson location.

Jackson has been struggling to restore water for weeks after winter storms crippled production at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

The plant, which is located in Ridgeland, brings in water from the Ross Barnett Reservoir, which it treats and sends out into the system.

However, the freezing temperatures brought in with the storms caused equipment there to freeze and water production to be cut by about half.

Typically, the plant can treat around 50 million gallons of water per day. However, during the storm, production fell to around 27 million gallons, Public Works Director Charles Williams said previously.

As a result of the decrease, the city’s reserve water tanks ran dry, water pressure fell and thousands of customers ended up with no water.

Williams said the city has been working to rebuild pressure in the system and explained that it needed to be around 90 PSI at the Curtis plant for water to be restored across the capital city.

However, pressure has yet to reach that point and has hovered in the mid-80s, and efforts to fully restore pressure have been met with several setbacks.

Among them, the city has experienced a number of water main breaks as the pressure in the system comes back up.

In all, about 80 breaks have been reported, of which 58 have been repaired.

Another setback occurred on Wednesday, March 3, when a mechanical issue was reported at one of the Curtis plant’s raw water screens, forcing the city to cut production so the issue could be fixed.

The raw water screens filter water being brought into the plant from the Ross Barnett Reservoir.

To make repairs, the city had to shut down production on the plant’s conventional treatment side, causing pressure there to fall to around 60 PSI.

Curtis treats water in two ways: the conventional method and the membrane method.

Water is allowed to settle at the Curtis plant's coventional basin, before it is chemically treated. (WLBT)

On the conventional side, water is pumped in directly from the reservoir and allowed to settle in a large basin before being chemically treated. On the membrane side, water is diverted past the conventional basin and pushed through membrane filters before being treated.

Williams hopes to have the problem fixed today. “We’re addressing that now. We’re trying to get it back up as quick as possible.”

110,19-Mar-21,WJTV,City of Jackson hosts virtual town hall meeting about preventive solutions to water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – The City of Jackson held a virtual town hall on Friday to discuss the city’s water infrastructure issues. City leaders and local restaurant owner Jeff Good came together to talk about solutions that could prevent further outages in Jackson.

“I have experienced a lot of failures with water failures and utility failures in the restaurant. When this crisis happened, the first week it occurred, my phone was ringing off the hook and lots of messages on Facebook and emails asking ‘Why is this happening. There’s got to be a way to fix this.’ So, there’s this moment here where we have the nation’s attention, and if we, as citizens, can become educated as possible as to how the system works and then where we need to go next and how we can work together. I think the beauty of this is that I reached out to two weeks ago, and the pledge was, when this crisis passes we’ll take this time to do it. So the crisis has passed, but we are just ready for the next crisis,” said Good.

While the City of Jackson has lifted its boil water notices for all areas, many neighbors are still in need of necessities such as food, water and soap.","(WJTV) – The City of Jackson held a virtual town hall on Friday to discuss the city’s water infrastructure issues.

Hospitals are reporting that the worst of the pandemic's third wave is over. Mississippi's capital city is in Week 4 of a water crisis. And the queen's response to the Meghan and Harry interview? Four sentences.

But first, looking for a COVID-19 vaccine? This website may text you when a vaccine is about to go unused. (Speaking of texts, have you signed up to get the Short List SMS messages?)

The Short List is a snappy USA TODAY news roundup. Subscribe here!

One. More. Day.

The only thing between you and another round of COVID-19 relief is one House vote and President Joe Biden's signature. The House of Representatives is poised to pass Biden's $1.9 trillion relief plan on Wednesday with $1,400 checks, billions for vaccines and money to reopen schools. The Senate passed the bill over the weekend after a marathon session. Once the House has passed the legislation and Biden's signed it, stimulus checks will start to go out in a matter of weeks. Could the bill not pass? It's possible, but unlikely.

Where's Joe?: The latest batch of stimulus checks will look a little different from the two previous rounds. The president’s signature will be missing. “This is not about him,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “This is about the American people getting relief.”

The queen has spoken

Two days after Oprah Winfrey's jaw-dropping interview with Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, Buckingham Palace (finally) clapped back, saying the couple's accusations of racism and lack of support are taken ""very seriously"" and will be addressed by the royal family ""privately."" The statement from the palace, issued Tuesday on behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, Harry's grandmother, said: ""The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning."" The message was typical of palace statements on behalf of the queen: calm and anything but profuse.

What everyone’s talking about

How will Chauvin's trial have an impartial jury?

Jury selection was underway Tuesday in the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who is charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of George Floyd (possibly third-degree murder, too). Millions of people watched George Floyd take his last breath while pinned under Chauvin's knee. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets to protest police killings of Black men like him, chanting his last words: ""I can't breathe."" Now, lawyers must find 12 people in and around Minneapolis who haven't made up their minds about what happened. In such a high-profile case, we expect that won't be easy.

The worst of the pandemic's third wave is over

Promising news on the COVID-19 front: Hospitals are reporting that the worst of the pandemic's third wave is over. Detailed data released this week by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services illustrates just how much the nation's hospitals have recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic's third wave. Although more than 1,500 Americans are dying of COVID-19 every day, the share of COVID-19 patients make up a decreasing share of hospital admissions around the country. The number of hospitals with more than half of patients infected with COVID-19 has dropped from 193 to 10 since early January. Intensive care units have become less strained as well.

Real quick

There is a water crisis in Mississippi

Imagine having to lug gallons of water home from a distribution site — just to flush the toilet. Water pressure so low that it’s difficult to take a shower or wash dishes. And even if there were water flowing from the faucets, it wouldn't be safe to drink. That’s what thousands of people in Jackson, Mississippi, are facing nearly a month after a brutal winter storm passed through and knocked out water pressure. Officials said early this week that the pressure was being restored, but the situation there still isn’t resolved: The water in Jackson is unsafe to drink – and has been since a boil water notice was issued Feb. 16.

How did this happen? What we know about the crisis in Mississippi's capital city.

115,25-Feb-21,Mississippi Today,"Winter storm prompts review of Mississippi’s electric, gas, water infrastructure","Mississippi’s public service commissioners announced on Wednesday that they are launching a comprehensive review of the state’s public utility infrastructure in response to the damages caused by last week’s winter storm.

The goal of the review, which will begin immediately, is to ensure that all reasonable steps are taken to ensure utility services across the state are reliable.

The commission, which regulates the state’s public utilities that offer electricity, water and gas, noted that the state’s electric and natural gas utilities performed well during the winter storm, but that regulators still need to guarantee systems are in place to avoid costly and damaging large-area outages — similar to what happened last week in Texas.

“While Mississippi utilities are accustomed to extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes, winter storms are much rarer,” the commission wrote in a press release. “The latest winter storm presented new challenges to Mississippi utilities that the commission feels must be addressed immediately and forthrightly.”

Last week’s historic winter storm wrecked public infrastructure and disrupted public services across the state. Hundreds of thousands of Mississippians lost power at some point during the winter storm, and residents in dozens of Mississippi cities and towns also went without water or had low water pressure. Thousands of residents across the cities of Jackson and Vicksburg still have no water service.

“It is our highest duty as commissioners to make sure that we not only solve problems but anticipate them ahead of time,” Public Service Commissioner Brandon Presley said. “This latest winter storm has presented challenges that must be addressed in a formal and thorough manner. Mississippians deserve to have every assurance that the public and private power grid, water and other utility services will be there at all times. After all, the customers are the ones paying for it. Working families and small businesses are already financially struggling because of the pandemic, we must protect their pocketbooks along the way.”

119,1 month ago,Next City,"How Jackson, Mississippi’s New Comprehensive Plan Foregrounds Race","The last time the city of Jackson, Mississippi developed a comprehensive plan, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was graduating high school. (He’s now 38.) Lumumba became mayor in 2017 in an election that was said to represent a new era for Jackson and the South. In his campaigning, he stressed that solutions for the city’s crises — including economic inequality, budget cuts and crumbling infrastructure — shouldn’t come from the upper levels of government or policy advisors — but instead the very people who have long been marginalized by the political status quo.

It was under that belief his administration kicked off a new comprehensive planning process which in many ways has centered around Washington Addition, a predominantly Black neighborhood that faced significant city neglect but is undergoing new development due to its proximity to Jackson State University. More recently, this community engagement translated to the mayor’s response to the water crisis caused by February storms.

“Many of the groups that have participated in some way in our planning processes activated and provided mutual aid during the water crisis,” says Mayor Lumumba. “I would say that relationships became the forefront of the mutual aid process … that is something that Jackson, as a whole, not limited to city government by itself, seems to be extremely skilled at.”

Mayor Lumumba’s focus on Washington Addition predates the larger citywide comprehensive plan and essentially shaped that process to come. In many ways, this neighborhood — one of the first African American communities in Jackson — embodies struggles of predominantly Black communities across the country.

What became a working-class enclave intimately tied to the university was badly impacted by white flight from the city in the 1970s and 80s. “Like much of West Jackson, Washington Addition became, by the 1990s, an almost forgotten area,” according to a history of the neighborhood. By 2000, nearly one-quarter of all housing units were vacant. In 2002, the university formed the Jackson State Center for University Based Development to help spur revitalization efforts.

The Mayor’s office wanted a more active role in the relationship between Washington Addition and Jackson State University, especially as development interest increased. In 2019 the administration kicked off its first neighborhood planning process here. “It was an attempt to use existing staff, who carried multiple duties at the time, and attempting to do the first neighborhood plan in quite a number of years,” explains Jordan Rae Hillman, director of planning and development for the city.

With limited staff and infrastructure, the city’s planning team got creative. The city forged a partnership with the local Jim Hill High School to create the Jim Hill Neighborhood Planning Team. In February of 2019 the team, which included high school students, held a neighborhood survey outside a Family Dollar Store. Responses were used to develop neighborhood statistics on quality of life issues including housing, open space, transit, blight and healthy food access. The city also tracked property conditions, vacant land conditions and existing land use to create a GIS map.

“We actually didn’t come out of this with a written plan to date,” notes Hillman. “We came out of this with internal goals through supporting the neighborhood with our services better.” It also revealed that the planning team needed more capacity to continue the work. “The Washington Addition work really solidified we needed to resource build — we jumped in without the true resources to support it,” Hillman says.

Given years of government funding cuts, resource building looked as basic as replacing outdated computers, utilizing modern mapping and data software and hiring dedicated neighborhood planning staff. “We’ve prioritized it within our latest budget,” notes Mayor Lumumba.

In February, planners kicked off citywide comprehensive planning to get a big-picture look at existing resources and needs across the city. “We really had to engage with one another to identify what we want to build and what we want to see,” as Mayor Lumumba put it. Then the challenges hit: major flooding in early 2020, followed by COVID-19. February’s winter storms caused a five-week water crisis that was years in the making, due to infrastructure neglect and tax cutting by the Republican-led state government alongside a shrinking tax base exacerbated by white flight.

That crisis deepened the urgency to prioritize infrastructure in city planning, according to Mayor Lumumba. “The comprehensive plan is not a replacement for a capital improvement plan,” he notes. “The comprehensive plan will look at the systemic planning decisions and population decline that contributed to our infrastructure challenges over the past fifty years, and the policies developed will be focused on creating the population base and land use pattern that is needed to maximize the use of our existing infrastructure.”

The city navigated other challenges. It couldn’t replicate some of its successful engagement initiatives in Washington Addition, like partnering with local schools or conducting in-person neighborhood surveys, during COVID-19. Instead, the city partnered with the Central Mississippi Planning & Development District and the nonprofit One Voice to begin digital and telephone outreach, as well as some socially-distant gatherings. Mayor Lumumba also focused on the transition from neighborhood planning in Washington Addition to the rest of Jackson during his Just City Mayoral Fellowship with the Mayor’s Institute on City Design.

“What we have to realize is that engagement doesn’t stop with this process — it requires ongoing communication, an ongoing investment in what the community is saying they want and need,” Mayor Lumumba says. “So as we’re engaging the community about blight elimination, for example, we’re dealing with it in a strategic way that doesn’t just set the stage for gentrification.”

Indeed, one thing that will set this comprehensive plan apart from its predecessor is prioritizing how race and racism has deeply shaped the city. “We know we have a very racist history here,” Hillman says. “The level it worked into how our housing looks today is the story we are trying to tell, and then match our recommendations and interventions moving forward with how we reconcile that. We think it’s a really important conversation between the white and Black community in Jackson.”

An internal planning team is currently studying matters like redlining and discriminatory zoning in specific Jackson neighborhoods. Washington Addition, for example, was marketed as a “colored subdivision” when homes went on the market in the early 1900s.

The goal is to finish the comprehensive plan this year, which will identify neighborhood planning districts throughout the city. (While it will provide guidance on priorities to support economic and neighborhood stability and growth, it will not identify specific projects, the mayor says.) The team will then return its focus to Washington Addition to complete a plan that builds off all the city’s prior work.

When Mayor Lumumba thinks on the importance of this comprehensive planning for Jackson, he quotes Scripture: “People without a vision perish,” he says. “I believe that. I believe that without a true plan, we really have no idea where we’re going. And as you’re looking for people to make investments in your community, they need to see the overall mission of the community and where we’re headed.”

120,3-Mar-21,WLBT,"Non-profit works to keep disabled people out of nursing homes, amid water crisis, pandemic","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - A non-profit that helps Mississippians with disabilities is working to keep members of this close-knit, vulnerable group out of assisted living facilities.

Created through federal legislation, the non-profit organization named LIFE of Mississippi has been helping people with disabilities since 1992.

“We don’t look at the dis in disability, we look at abilities,” said program management coordinator Margie Moore.

While Mississippi (and the nation) was still reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic, Jackson was slammed by February’s Winter storm, limiting the number one resource; water.

“Some of our members are without water in South Jackson and we’ve been supplying water and food and making sure they have everything they need,” Moore said.

Jackson is now in week three of this water crisis, which has made national headlines. Everyone is under a boil water advisory, several schools remain closed and many people are still without water.

But for someone who already lacks mobility, these difficult times are a nightmare.

“You don’t have to be a wheelchair user like myself, you could be visually impaired or just can’t get to the site and it’s a stress and a struggle,” Desmeon Thomas said, a LIFE of Mississippi member.

Thomas was the innocent victim of a robbery in 2002 and lost his mobility to walk. He said the crisis can remind a disabled person of the obvious.

“It makes you realize all over what your limitations are. It’s stressful and can even bring about depression,” Thomas added.

But Thomas refuses to give into isolation. He helps bring awareness to the challenges people with disabilities face and also encourages others to focus on their abilities.

“If they drop off a bucket of non-potable water, we can’t pick it up, but we can take time to scoop the water out,” Thomas said. “And I commend the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency because they are working with the city to come up with these kinds of solutions for our community.”

And LIFE of Mississipi says the ultimate goal is to keep members out of nursing homes.

“We work with anyone to keep you in your own home,” Margi Moore said.

During the height of the pandemic, most long-term care facilities averaged over 200 virus outbreaks.

Now, there’s an average of 61 COVID-19 outbreaks, but LIFE is staying focused on its goal.

“We want to keep our people COVID-free and independent, which also helps them to stay mentally healthy.”

LIFE has delivered hundreds of hot meals, built six wheelchair ramps, donated truckloads of necessities, hosted basic skills training, and distributed vital COVID-19 supplies, such as face shields.

If someone can’t cook for themselves, LIFE ensures they have meals delivered to their home. If someone is visually impaired, LIFE connects them to resources for the blind. And even if someone was recently injured or disabled, LIFE sends a team member to the hospital to help them start their lives all over again.

It’s not just a job for Margie, but her life’s work after her son was diagnosed with a cognitive disability at a young age.

“Homework was like pulling your hair out because I didn’t understand what was going on,” Moore said. “I worked with a teacher to develop a plan to help make sure he was getting everything he needed. He just used a different method.”

Margie’s volunteer work turned into her passion.

“They’re just like everyone else. Everyone gets from point A to point B, but we all use a different method,” Moore said. “Some people put so much emphasis on the method, but it’s not about that. It’s just about getting where you need to be.”

122,25-Feb-21,WLBT,Volunteer fire departments band together to provide tankers to Jackson firefighters during water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - As Jackson firefighters wrestled the flames pouring out of an abandoned house on Clifton Street Friday, crews reported low water pressure from hydrants at that location.

Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Armon said his crews shuttled water, a practice that involves hooking hoses directly to the fire trucks themselves instead of hydrants.

“That’s not as easy as it is to just tap a hydrant and get on an endless supply of water,” Armon said. “It makes the task a little more difficult, but it’s nothing that we can’t overcome and can’t do.”

Armon said each truck holds five hundred gallons of water and they typically respond with five to six trucks.

What he’s concerned about are larger fires than they’ve battled thus far.

“If we were to have [a fire] on a larger scale, like a warehouse or one of those large structures, multi-unit apartment or something like that, that would be an issue,” Armon said. “That’s where we would have a major issue.”

Hinds County EMA Director Joey Perkins said the county’s twelve volunteer fire departments are specially suited to help because they’re used to carrying water to rural areas that don’t have hydrants.

“With water out in Jackson, where they can’t get it out of fire hydrants, we’re supplying them with tankers when they go to a fire that you know, haul 3,000, 4,000, 5000 gallons of water so they can extinguish the fire,” Perkins said.

Perkins said the volunteer fire departments don’t have an actual mutual aid agreement with the city of Jackson.

Instead, they offered to help on a “handshake deal” and step in when needed.

Since the water crisis and pressure concerns began, Armon said his crews have battled nearly a dozen fires across the city.

Only once have they required the county’s services.

However, Armon also wanted to address inadvertent misinformation put out during Gov. Tate Reeves’ Tuesday press conference, when the governor said the volunteer firefighters were not only capable of providing fire service for the city of Jackson, but claimed they were doing that now.

“The county is not providing services to the citizens. The Jackson Fire Department is providing fire service to the city of Jackson. We are a Class 3 fire department and the county volunteered to provide the city of Jackson with tankers,” Armon said.

Councilman Ashby Foote says he’s encouraged by the camaraderie between the county and city during this turbulent time.

“I don’t remember a time like this where we had the water pressure this low for this extended period of time and the realization that it may go on for another week or two. And I’m glad we were able to bring in some tankers and some bottled water to address the private citizens’ concerns with drinking water, but we also need to be very aware of the challenges it presents to the fire department,” Foote said.

126,1-Mar-21,Vox,"“It’s after the storm that’s the hardest part”: 390,000 Texans still don’t have clean water","As of Monday morning, it had been two weeks since Helen McCanick and her neighbors in Wharton, Texas, had running water. The freezing temperatures brought by Winter Storm Uri burst their pipes and broke the motor running their well.

McCanick has spent the days since the storm traversing neighboring towns, searching for the pipe and motor parts needed to restore her water. “I am very tired of running from place to place, I really am,” she said from the parking lot of yet another hardware store.

To cook and flush the toilet, the 73-year-old has had to resort to using donated water or heavy buckets she hauls from a local church. And with replacement parts in short supply after the storm, McCanick still doesn’t know when she’ll get her water back.

“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.

Even after the electricity came back on in most homes as of February 19, water problems have lingered on a large scale. As of Monday, nearly 390,000 Texans were still being told to boil their water due to safety concerns after the storm disrupted utility water supplies, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ). And that number doesn’t include the people, like McCanick, who can’t get water because their pipes broke in the cold — an issue that has affected thousands of homes in Houston alone.

The widespread failures in Texas reflect the domino effect that happens in many disasters, as power failures lead to breakdowns in water systems, putting people’s health and food security in danger. And Texas isn’t alone: Extreme weather — in some cases directly linked to climate change — has impacted water access for days, months, or even years in other states, including in the fire-ravaged West.

And yet, the long-term impacts of disasters on water systems often get less attention than the initial disaster.

For instance, the devastating Camp Fire in Paradise, California, made headlines in 2018 as the deadliest fire in the state’s history, but few know that 40,000 people were initially told to boil their water after the fire. And later, when carcinogenic chemicals were identified in the town’s pipes, Paradise residents were told not to drink their water at all — it wasn’t until more than six months after the fire that water access started to be restored.

As climate change increases the threat of extreme weather and disasters, it’s clear our infrastructure systems need to be able to withstand new pressures. And there’s a lot to learn from the latest water crises in Texas and California to avoid the next fiasco.

What caused the water failures in Texas

At the height of the water crisis on February 19, nearly 15 million people across Texas lost access to clean water, according to Gary Rasp, a spokesperson for TCEQ. This number reflects the problems that occurred in the water system itself, rather than in people’s homes.

Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, explained how the crisis rippled from the electricity grid to the water system. As the storm hit, the rapidly escalating blackout on February 15 forced water treatment plants offline. At the same time, the freezing temperatures broke water mains and people started to turn on their faucets to prevent their pipes from freezing.

Due to the combination of a drop in supply from treatment plants failing and the increase in water demand from dripping faucets and leaks, the pressure dropped in the system.

A loss in pressure can lead to dangerous bacteria in the water supply, so millions of people were told to boil their water before drinking or cooking with it. Of course, this was an impossibility for those who were also hit by the power outage and lacked electricity to power their stove.

The winter storm didn’t just cause water issues in Texas. From Oklahoma City to Jackson, Mississippi, hundreds of thousands of people also faced water shortages due to dropping water pressure.

Beyond these systemic failures, people like McCanick have also been dealing with problems closer to home, which aren’t reflected in the official numbers. One of the biggest issues has been broken pipes. In buildings not designed to weather the plunge in temperatures — from schools to houses — pipes froze and burst, sometimes dramatically, as captured in viral TikTok videos of flooded houses. Corinne Whitehead, a 70-year-old resident of San Antonio, told Vox she heard the squish of water on her floor as she stepped back into her apartment after the storm to find her pipes had burst.

And in some cases, residents have been without water for weeks because of a confluence of failures.

In the rapidly gentrifying Riverside neighborhood in Austin, Rebecca Sanchez told Vox that many of the residents in her apartment complex, the Hillside Villas, have been left without any running water for two weeks after pipes burst. Repairs have been slow, and Sanchez said the property managers have failed to provide adequate emergency water supplies in the interim. In response, she and other tenants organized a small protest last Tuesday, which the management tried to shut down by calling the police.

Afterward, the property managers accelerated the repairs, but Sanchez said half of the buildings still did not have water access as of Monday, while other properties in the area were back up and running. Further complicating matters, the city also discovered a broken water main near the complex on Friday, making the timeline for restoration of water access even less clear. The Hillside Villas property managers did not respond to a request for comment before publication.

For Sanchez, the water crisis has shown how the burden of disasters often compounds existing inequities. “It is mostly Black and brown [people’s] apartments and parts of the city that are feeling this,” she said. “There were entire white communities that never lost power and never lost water.”

Extreme weather threatens Western states’ water supplies

From the hurricanes that have hit the Gulf Coast to the wildfires that have spread across the Western US, many other communities have found themselves without clean water in the wake of recent disasters.

Just as widespread leaks and overuse caused the water system to fail after Winter Storm Uri, when houses or pipes burn in a wildfire, water pressure in distribution pipes can drop and can create a vacuum, sucking in contaminants. It was only after a resident smelled a strange odor in their tap water after the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, California, that scientists first uncovered such widespread chemical contamination (benzene in that case) in water systems after wildfires.

Since then, contamination after fires has led to thousands of people in a rising number of communities being put under “do not boil, do not drink” notices. This happened recently after the CZU fire struck Boulder Creek near Santa Cruz, California, in August, burning a 7-mile stretch of plastic water pipe. And like the lingering problems in Texas, these water systems have not been easy to rehabilitate.

In Boulder Creek, it took months for the water company to clear the system of the benzene — a dangerous carcinogen — initially detected, and conduct extensive testing to ensure it was really gone.

In the interim, Boulder Creek residents like Sophia Lwin-McGee were forced to live without tap water. She and her family hauled a 5-gallon water jug from a water spigot in town and tried to rely on that water or bottled water to drink, cook, and bathe.

Sitting on her deck overlooking the remains of a burnt redwood forest, Lwin-McGee told me in October that the lack of safe water access wasn’t something she expected in the US. “I feel like I’m back in Burma,” she said. “I left there when I was a kid to avoid this situation. But you know — take water, go to town, get water, bring it back — like, we are doing that every other day.”

Even after the local water company officially announced their water was safe, she and her family said they would continue avoiding the tap water as much as possible, at least for a year.

“I just can’t put myself and my son and my husband in that risk,” Lwin-McGee said. “So we are just going to have to buy bottled water to drink and cook with until, you know, we feel that it is safe.”

With climate change causing drier, hotter falls in the Western US, the conditions for extreme fires and impacts to water systems are increasing, according to a 2020 study published in Environmental Research Letters.

Stefan Cajina, a drinking water section chief for California’s State Water Resources Control Board, said he’s witnessed these changes firsthand. “I think in the last half-decade we have really seen an escalation in how [wildfires in] the wildland-urban interface can have an impact on water systems and communities in general,” he told me this fall. (Residential areas like Paradise and Boulder Creek that are on the edge of forests are described as the WUI, or wildland-urban interface, and are the most vulnerable to destructive fires.)

These rising threats mean fortifying infrastructure to handle extremes is all the more important. But Emily Grubert points out that even where climate change isn’t definitively linked to the extreme weather event, as is the case with the winter storm in Texas, the fundamental need for more resilient infrastructure is clear.

Related Scientists are divided over whether climate change is fueling extreme cold events

“We underinvest in maintenance to such a degree that these disasters tend to be pretty catastrophic,” she said. The failure of infrastructure is still being felt by the 390,000 people boiling their water in Texas today, and the nearly 2,000 people whose utilities were still not delivering water at all as of Friday, according to TCEQ.

“Adapting to extreme events and adapting to climate change is going to make all of this harder, but that’s not the only thing that is a problem,” Grubert said. “What we are really starting to have to face is this kind of combined issue where we have failed to invest in these systems for a very long time, and now we are also playing on hard mode.”","“You went through the storm, and now it’s after the storm that’s the hardest part,” she said.
And yet, the long-term impacts of disasters on water systems often get less attention than the initial disaster.
Further complicating matters, the city also discovered a broken water main near the complex on Friday, making the timeline for restoration of water access even less clear.

127,2-Mar-21,Patch,"A Power Crisis Turns Into A Water Crisis. That Story And More Headlines For March 2, 2021","An arctic blast has sent frigid air to as far south as the U.S.–Mexico border. Sixty-nine deaths were blamed on the extreme weather, including many who perished struggling to get warm. The Texas Tribune reported that hospitals saw a spike in people suffering carbon monoxide poisoning from burning things like charcoal or gas heaters in their homes while trying to stay warm. Although power was being restored, many still had no water, and millions who did were warned that may it be unsafe to drink and should be boiled.

Last week, a blast of frigid air dropped deep into the heart of the U.S., affecting millions of people. The so-called polar vortex that normally circulates cold air around the North Pole was disturbed and sent arctic temperatures much farther south. And the breakdown of this polar vortex was a whopper—one of the biggest, nastiest, and longest-lasting meteorologists have seen, overwhelming the Texas power grid and cutting off electricity to millions.

The crisis was not confined to Texas. In Tennessee, hundreds of thousands of people were under a boil advisory, and in Jackson, Mississippi, at one point most of the city had no running water.

Nearly 15 million people were affected by disruptions and some resorted to using snow to flush toilets. At food bank and water distribution sites, lines stretched as long as a mile. The Texas Tribune reported that systems couldn't treat or pump water without electricity, and that in some cases reduced water pressure was caused by millions of people dripping their faucets for days so pipes wouldn't freeze. In Houston, the public works department had to slow down the water treatment process since the chemical feed lines had frozen, and in Austin the water supply lost 325 million gallons due to burst pipes.

Besides problems in the U.S., the meandering polar vortex brought snow to Greece and Turkey, and CBS reports that in Saudi Arabia snow-covered camels made for a rare sight.

Insurance companies are expecting hundreds of thousands of claims, with the event likely to be the largest disaster in Texas history.

Judah Cohen of Atmospheric and Environmental Research told the Guardian that the uptick in winter storms is a symptom of heating in the Arctic that is disrupting long-established climate systems.

Liz Sherwood-Randall, a National Security Advisor to the White House, said that the extreme weather events across the central, southern, and eastern United States demonstrate again that climate change is real and happening now, and the country is not adequately prepared for it. She noted that power grids across the country, particularly in Texas, are overloaded by the demands that are placed on them under these circumstances, and the infrastructure is not built to withstand these extreme conditions.

Cold Weather Causes a Spike in Pollution from Fossil Fuel Infrastructure

During the cold weather event in Texas, refineries, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure were freezing up and releasing pollutants into the air, an analysis has found. The online news site Earther looked at reports from the Texas Department of Environmental Quality that showed that during the week ending February 18, polluting events occurred at a rate about four times higher than other recent seven-day periods before the cold weather struck.

Data from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality for reported emissions events over the past three weeks shows a sharp uptick during the cold weather outbreak | Credit: Earther with data compiled by Earthworks



For example, ExxonMobil's refinery near Houston spewed 68,000 pounds of carbon monoxide over the course of two days as it struggled with the cold. The specific health impacts of this kind of pollution on Texans is well documented.

Sharon Wilson of Earthworks told Earther that all oil and gas infrastructure starts with a hole in the ground, and it keeps pumping even if machinery is frozen. So, when a pipeline is frozen, everything gets released into the air and just keeps going. She said that some reports noted glitches as tiny as a frozen switch stalled operations and forced excess gas to be released, adding that if the industry had winterized their equipment, the pollution could have been avoided.

Thousands of Paralyzed Sea Turtles Rescued from Freezing Waters

The extreme cold also caused problems for marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico. Sea turtles are cold-blooded animals that regulate their bodies by the water temperature, and as National Geographic reports, when it dips below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, their heart rates slow, leaving them conscious but paralyzed.



Many turtles washed up onshore at South Padre Island, and in response, an army of people—many of whom were struggling themselves to survive—rushed to rescue about 5,000 of the creatures. Some turtles were taken to a rescue facility and more than 4,000 were sheltered in a nearby convention center, resting on tarps spread out on every foot of floor space—including the gift shop. Even when that center lost power, it was still warmer for the turtles than being in the sea. One of those rescued weighed about 400 pounds and was at least 150 years old. It took ten men to hoist it onto a truck.

Scientists are monitoring water temperatures so they can safely release the turtles. Without the rescue, 40 years of conservation work to protect them could have been wiped out.

Study: Frogs Could Lose Their Ability to Hop

As the climate shifts there are concerns about how Earth's biodiversity will respond. Not only are regions getting warmer, but precipitation patterns are changing, and, according to a new study, the combination could make frogs lose the ability to hop.

New paper from Dan Greenberg and Wendy Palen illustrates the importance of integrating species' hydration physiology into forecasts of climate vulnerability, as forecasts using thermal physiology alone may significantly underestimate the effects of future climate change on Earth's biological diversity. | Credit: Palen Lab/Simon Fraser University



Scientists from Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, did an experiment with three species: the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), which lives near cold mountain streams, the desert-adapted great basin spadefoot toad (Spea intermontana), and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla), which can adjust to various habitats.

As NewScientist reports, the researchers placed frogs and toads in climate-controlled chambers where they could dictate the amphibian's temperature and hydration. They found that the more dehydrated the frogs were, the shorter distance they could leap—and once they lost 30 percent of their body weight they stopped jumping entirely. The frogs and toads were even more impacted when they were both dehydrated and subjected to warmer temperatures—as will likely happen with climate change.

The scientists think there are a few reasons for the reduced ability to leap, one of which could be that as the animals become dehydrated their blood becomes thicker and harder for their heart muscles to pump. One of the researchers, Dan Greenberg, said as soon as the temperatures went up a little bit, the tree frogs in particular would sort of hunker down in a way that reduces water loss, as if they were thinking, 'This isn't going to be good for me.""

Since many frogs jump to avoid predators, this could have devastating consequences, and the researchers think their findings might have implications for other animals like insects, arthropods, and reptiles.

The paper was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.

Watering Restrictions Have a Surprising Bonus

Adhering to water conservation mandates and watching how much you use your sprinklers may have an added benefit—fewer mosquitoes. According to a new study from UCLA, mosquito populations would have been 40 percent higher in Southern California had water use mandates not been in place.

Mosquitoes, like those that carry West Nile virus, Zika, and dengue fever, can breed in just a few milliliters of water—about a bottlecap's worth—sitting in the shade for a few days. Hundreds of eggs hatch at a time before the insects grow into biting adults in just over a week. The researchers say that reducing shallow pools of water is key to preventing the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.

Looking at Orange and Los Angeles counties from 2012 to 2016 they found that the numbers of mosquitoes declined more in lower-income areas than in wealthier neighborhoods—most likely, they say, because homeowners who could afford to ignored restrictions and continued watering their lawns and gardens.

The authors note that as the planet warms, keeping lawns green and healthy will be challenging, so replacing them with drought-tolerant plants and creating green infrastructure would not only conserve water and reduce bills but also make it less likely to get bit by a disease-transmitting mosquito.

The study was published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology.

132,1 month ago,WJTV,Jackson Public Works director provides update on efforts to fix wells,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Even those on the well water system in Jackson and Byram have gotten tied up in the City of Jackson’s water crisis with no clear timeframe on how long till it gets fixed or what needs to be replaced. Crews are still digging around the TV Road well, which distributes water to more than 2,000 customers along with Maddox, Raymond, and TV Road communities. Going into day seven of little to no water pressure, people are demanding more accountability.

For seven months Tangela Williams and her son worked to turn their new home off Forest Hill Road into their dream house. For the past week, simple house chores are becoming impossible to do without running water.

“This is actually clean bottled water I had used to pour and be up to date to be able to cook,” Williams stated. “Here’s another bottle of water I have to use to drink, to cook, and all that because I have no water.”

After restoring running water to the well off Siwell Road, contractors with Jackson are able to focus more on the TV Road well, but they will have many pipes to dig through. They won’t know what needs to be fixed until Tuesday morning.

“It’s a very labor-intensive and tedious work in order to break down a well and determine the cause and then gets it repaired,” Dr. Charles Williams, Jackson’s Public Works Director, said. “So, it takes some time, and we understand time is really not on our side because we have customers who are without water.”

For days, the Williams family have been unable to wash dishes, on top of going elsewhere to simply shower as early as 4:00 a.m. They’re even relying on rainwater saved in a trashcan to flush toilets.

“Even when they have the water giveaways it’s during work hours, people at work, we don’t have time to go get water. We’re working so that doesn’t do any good for those who work so we have to spend money on water,” said Williams.

The water well on Siwell Road ended up needing a new pump to be fully repaired, which the Public Works Department has yet to find. Until they do, the best scenario on how to fix the TV Road well remains unknown.

All well customers along with TV and Siwell Road for the time being remain under a boil water notice. They are asked to conserve water.

Tangela and her neighbors add that they’re unsure if they’ll continue to live in Jackson if this continues.","Crews are still digging around the TV Road well, which distributes water to more than 2,000 customers along with Maddox, Raymond, and TV Road communities.

133,3 weeks ago,WLBT,"Resolution to change Jackson’s form of government sent back to committee after mayor, councilwoman express concerns","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - A resolution that would have signified unity among Jackson city councilmembers to embrace a new form of government for the Capital City now resides in a committee without a vote because of concerns expressed from the city’s mayor and a councilwoman Tuesday about citizens being cut out or unduly influenced by the action.

“I really feel like this is just the cart before the horse. And I really think that with all due respect, [Ward 4 Councilman De’Keither] Stamps, I think I’m just gonna vote against it,” said Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay, shortly before Council President Aaron Banks sent the resolution back to the committee from which it originated.

The measure, placed on the agenda by Stamps days ago, would have been non-binding; changing a city’s form of government requires a petition and referendum before it can move forward, according to state law.

“What we have now is a system that’s great for contractors. But is it good for people? Is it good for progress? Is it good for efficiency?” Stamps said in an interview Wednesday. “Does it root out fraud, waste, and abuse? And those are the types of questions and answers that we have to start seeking.”

Stamps remains particularly frustrated because of the city’s ongoing water crisis; he stressed to council members Tuesday that he cannot truly address the needs of his residents without going through a process that may not even lead to help for his residents.

“I got folks ain’t had water in a month, right? And all we get is a pump, the most minimum thing to fix the problem? Well, I want the complete solution. I want more towers, I want more water in west and south Jackson. But if I don’t have four votes to do it, under this structure, it’s not gonna happen,” Stamps said.

Jackson’s strong mayor-weak council form of government puts the day-to-day operations of the city with the mayor, with the council holding the purse strings, setting policy and drafting the budget.

The council-manager form, which Stamps has been advocating for since 2016, would establish a city manager to handle day-to-day issues and let the mayor run council meetings, with both of them setting policy for the city.

“Over half of the governments in this country run on the council-manager form of government. A lot of big cities,” Stamps said, citing Las Vegas, Nevada, and Norfolk, Virginia as examples.

Several cities in Mississippi do, too.

“The city manager form of government, in my opinion, certainly does provide more accountability,” said Michael Silverman, who serves as city manager for Pascagoula until June 17.

Silverman has served in this position for more than a year and a half, working as city manager for a municipality in Michigan before coming to Mississippi.

“Because city managers are not obligated to serve just one elected official, it’s obligated to serve the entire governing body. And it’s the city manager’s job to make sure they’re addressing the needs of each and every counselor, no matter the ward, no matter the issue,” Silverman said.

Silverman said it also means greater stability for city departments.

With the city of Jackson’s current form of government, department directors are usually replaced once a new mayor takes office.

In the council-manager form, however, the same city manager could continue independent of newly-elected council or mayoral candidates.

The position allows for a qualified professional to manage city departments in a non-partisan, independent way, Silverman added.

Stamps said the challenges facing the city have only gotten worse since he first proposed the change.

Jackson has had a mayor-council form of government since the mid-1980s.

“We’ve had almost two wards pack up and leave Jackson with our population decline. So should we have seven council people? Or should we have less? Our budget on government is increasing, but our population is decreasing. So we must restructure our government based on what we can afford,” Stamps said. “The goal is a unified leadership. The city can’t move forward and be the one voice that it should be when it has multiple voices. We need one leadership. And so this structure will allow us to unify the leadership to be on one accord.”

It also takes significant control of day-to-day functions away from the mayor.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said he wanted to be reserved in his comments about the subject during Tuesday’s meeting, but expressed a concern about representation in communities and the resolution coming before the council before any grassroots effort to gather petitions had kicked off.

“I think the long history of politics tells us that when people feel that someone is imposing or stating their will over people without their voice, whether it’s over the governance of the city of Jackson, or whether it’s over the price of tea, people have a lot of issues with that,” Lumumba said. “And so we need to look deep in the history and understand that the council speaks through its resolutions. It doesn’t start the [legal] process, but it certainly puts you on the line for what your position is for the people without them having stated their case.”

135,19-Feb-21,Oregon Live,Extreme cold and water shortages: Weather blamed in deaths of at least 58 people across U.S.,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Many of the millions of Texans who lost power for days after a deadly winter blast overwhelmed the electric grid now have it back, but the crisis was far from over in parts of the South, with many people lacking safe drinking water.

More than 190,000 homes and businesses remained without power in Texas according to poweroutage.us Friday morning, down from about 3 million two days earlier, though utility officials said limited rolling blackouts were still possible.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The snow and ice moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the Northeast as the extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 58 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond and 17-year-old Oklahoma girl who fell into a frozen pond.

A growing number of people have perished trying to keep warm. In and around the western Texas city of Abilene, authorities said six people died of the cold — including a 60-year-old man found dead in his bed in his frigid home. In the Houston area, a family died from carbon monoxide as their car idled in their garage.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas used rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. But the remaining Texas outages were mostly weather-related, according to the state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said Friday that teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

Rotating outages for Texas could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, said Dan Woodfin, the council’s senior director of system operations.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott warned that residents “are not out of the woods,” with temperatures still well below freezing statewide, south central Texas threatened by a winter storm and disruptions in food supply chains.

Adding to the misery: The weather jeopardized drinking water systems. Authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it, following the record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and pipes. In Abilene, a man who died at a health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

Water pressure dropped after lines froze and because many people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, said Toby Baker, executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Abbott urged residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

President Joe Biden said he called Abbott on Thursday evening and offered additional support from the federal government to state and local agencies.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Federal emergency officials sent generators to support water treatment plants, hospitals and nursing homes in Texas, along with thousands of blankets and ready-to-eat meals, officials said. The Texas Restaurant Association was coordinating food donations to hospitals.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water after cold temperatures led to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

In Texas, more than 300 flights in and out of Dallas and Houston were canceled Friday, according to flightaware.com. Particularly affected was American Airlines, headquartered in Fort Worth.

In Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said most of the city of about 161,000 was without water Thursday night. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals to treat the water, she said.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

About 85 seniors in a Jackson apartment building lost water service Monday and were relying on deliveries from a building manager, said resident Linda Weathersby.

Weathersby went outside collecting buckets of ice to melt it so she could flush her toilet and said “my back’s hurting now.”

Before the wintry weather moved from Texas, the city of Del Rio along the U.S.-Mexico border, got nearly 10 inches (25.4 cm) of snow on Thursday, surpassing the city’s one-day record for snowfall.

136,15-Apr-21,Mic,We don't trust our tap water — and it's a big problem,"Imagine seeing a news report about lead contamination in drinking water in a community that looks like yours. It might make you think twice about whether to drink your tap water or serve it to your kids – especially if you also have experienced tap water problems in the past.

In a new study, my colleagues Anisha Patel, Francesca Weaks and I estimate that approximately 61.4 million people in the U.S. did not drink their tap water as of 2017-2018. Our research, which was released in preprint format on April 8, 2021, and has not yet been peer reviewed, found that this number has grown sharply in the past several years.

Other research has shown that about 2 million Americans don’t have access to clean water. Taking that into account, our findings suggest that about 59 million people have tap water access from either their municipality or private wells or cisterns, but don’t drink it. While some may have contaminated water, others may be avoiding water that’s actually safe.

Water insecurity is an underrecognized but growing problem in the U.S. Tap water distrust is part of the problem. And it’s critical to understand what drives it, because people who don’t trust their tap water shift to more expensive and often less healthy options, like bottled water or sugary drinks.

I’m a human biologist and have studied water and health for the past decade in places as diverse as Lowland Bolivia and northern Kenya. Now I run the Water, Health, and Nutrition Laboratory at Pennsylvania State University. To understand water issues, I talk to people and use large datasets to see whether a problem is unique or widespread, and stable or growing.

An epidemic of distrust

According to our research, there’s a growing epidemic of tap water distrust and disuse in the U.S. In a 2020 study, anthropologist Sera Young and I found that tap water avoidance was declining before the Flint water crisis that began in 2014. In 2015-2016, however, it started to increase again for children.

Our new study found that in 2017-2018, the number of Americans who didn’t drink tap water increased at an alarmingly high rate, particularly for Black and Hispanic adults and children. Since 2013-2014 — just before the Flint water crisis began — the prevalence of adults who do not drink their tap water has increased by 40%. Among children, not consuming tap has risen by 63%.

To calculate this change, we used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey that releases data in two-year cycles. Sampling weights that use demographic characteristics ensure that the people being sampled are representative of the broader U.S. population.

Racial disparities in tap water consumption

Communities of color have long experienced environmental injustice across the U.S. Black, Hispanic and Native American residents are more likely to live in environmentally disadvantaged neighborhoods, with exposure to water that violates quality standards.

Our findings reflect these experiences. We calculated that Black and Hispanic children and adults are two to three times more likely to report not drinking their tap water than members of white households. In 2017-2018, roughly 3 out of 10 Black adults and children and nearly 4 of 10 Hispanic adults and children didn’t drink their tap water. Approximately 2 of 10 Asian Americans didn’t drink from their tap, while only 1 of 10 white Americans didn’t drink their tap water.

When children don’t drink any water on a given day, research shows that they consume twice as many calories from sugary drinks as children who drink water. Higher sugary drink consumption increases risk of cavities, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. Drinking tap water provides fluoride, which lowers the risk of cavities. Relying on water alternatives is also much more expensive than drinking tap water.

What erodes trust

News reports — particularly high-visibility events like advisories to boil water — lead people to distrust their tap water even after the problem is fixed. For example, a 2019 study showed that water quality violations across the U.S. between 2006 and 2015 led to increases in bottled water purchases in affected counties as a way to avoid tap water, and purchase rates remained elevated after the violation.

The Flint water crisis drew national attention to water insecurity, even though state and federal regulators were slow to respond to residents’ complaints there. Soon afterward, lead contamination was found in the water supply of Newark, New Jersey; the city is currently replacing all lead service lines under a legal settlement. Elsewhere, media outlets and advocacy groups have reported finding tap water samples contaminated with industrial chemicals, lead, arsenic and other contaminants.

Many other factors can cause people to distrust their water supply, including smell, taste and appearance, as well as lower income levels. Location is also an issue: Older U.S. cities with aging infrastructure are more prone to water shutoffs and water quality problems.

It’s important not to blame people for distrusting what comes out of their tap, because those fears are rooted in history. In my view, addressing water insecurity requires a two-part strategy: ensuring that everyone has access to clean water, and increasing trust so people who have safe water will use it.

Building confidence

As part of his proposed infrastructure plan, President Joe Biden is asking Congress for $111 billion to improve water delivery systems, replace lead pipelines and tackle other contaminants. The plan also proposes improvements for small water systems and underserved communities.

These are critical steps to rebuild trust. Yet, in my view, the Environmental Protection Agency should also provide better public education about water quality testing and targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, such as children and underserved communities. Initiatives to simplify and improve water quality reports can help people understand what’s in their water and what they can do if they think something is wrong with it.

Who delivers those messages is important. In areas like Flint, where former government officials have been indicted on charges including negligence and perjury in connection with the water crisis, the government’s word alone won’t rebuild trust. Instead, community members can fill this critical role.

Another priority is the 13%-15% of Americans who rely on private well water, which is not regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. These households are responsible for their own water quality testing. Public funding would help them test it regularly and address any problems.

Public distrust of tap water in the U.S. reflects decades of policies that have reduced access to reliable, safe drinking water in communities of color. Fixing water lines is important, but so is giving people confidence to turn on the tap.

Many residents of Jackson, Miss., remain without running water three weeks after a winter storm hit the city.

The water outages in Jackson began Feb. 15 as a winter storm swept across the state. The storm brought devastating, bitter cold to the South and hit the region's critical infrastructure hard--highlighting major vulnerabilities in the area's power grid and water system.

Some water treatment plants in the city couldn't operate in the freezing temperatures that lingered for days. Because plants were shut down for so long, water pressure in the city dropped.

As of March 3, service had been restored in some areas, but a boil water notice remained in effect for many residents, according to city officials.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said March 1 in a Twitter post that the city has ""made some strides"" restoring water service, but more work needs to be done.

But the timeline of when full water service could be restored is unclear.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the plants are back online, but the water pressure needs to be at a consistent rate for it to reach the homes farthest from the treatment plants.

In the meantime, city officials and the National Guard are distributing non-potable water to people. That water can be used to flush toilets, but can be used for little else.

In the meantime, residents such as Wayne Johnson are traveling through the city filling milk jugs and other containers with water. Johnson told NPR his elderly neighbor has been without water since Feb. 16.

He said, ""She's elderly, she can't handle jugs of water so I'm catching water. Got coolers and jugs and everything else. I'm filling bathtubs up with water and everything else to flush and do what we can.""

Lumumba said the water system's failure has only served to highlight issues that have existed for decades. He said the city needs state and federal funding to help replace 100-year-old pipes.

He said, ""They have been described as peanut brittle when our crews jump into holes in order to repair them. Sometimes they'll repair one break, stay for a little while, and see another break happen mere yards away from the one that they just repaired.""","Like 'Peanut Brittle': Mississippi Water Crisis Highlights Infrastructure ProblemsEnlarge this image toggle caption Rogelio V.

At a Glance Devastating winter storms cracked water mains, froze equipment and shut treatment plants.

Hundreds of thousands of people remain under boil water notices.

Thousands of others have broken pipes in their homes.

In the weeks following two deadly and devastating winter storms, millions of people across the South have seen their power restored. Unfortunately, hundreds of thousands remain without clean water.

From Texas to Mississippi, cities are telling residents they still need to boil water after the frigid weather cracked water mains, froze equipment and shut down treatment plants.

For many more, boiling water would be a welcome burden. They have no running water at all after their pipes froze and burst during the storms.

In Jackson, Mississippi, where 96 water main breaks or leaks were found, the National Guard is helping distribute non-potable water that can be used to flush toilets, the city said in a news release. Boil water notices were issued for 43,000 homes and businesses on Feb. 17.

(WATCH: Texas Cold Outbreak More Deadly Than Hurricane Harvey?)

As of Monday night, the Water Maintenance Department had completed 51 repairs. Water pressure remains low, and engineers need to get it back to 90 pounds per square inch to restore flow to everyone.

""This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the city's news release said.

Barbara Howard, a Jackson State University professor, lives in South Jackson, the area of the city hit hardest by the water problems.

She collects rainwater in a 5-gallon bucket to use for flushing her toilet. That's easier than going to the distribution sites, she told the Clarion Ledger. Gallon jugs of distilled water are for brushing her teeth and washing her hands.

Advertisement “I appreciate the tanks. I appreciate the bottled water,"" Howard said. ""But I'd rather have the pipes fixed. It’s one thing to put a Band-Aid on the problem and it’s one thing to fix it. A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough.”

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said Sunday at a news conference, ""I know residents are trying to understand this process and be patient — they just want to see water. I think it's important to start with the understanding that what we have faced and what we have seen as a result of the winter storm, water treatment facilities are not meant to shut down at the level that we experienced.""

Charles Williams, the city's public works director, told WAPT his department is trying to get a definitive timeline of when water will be restored to everyone.

""We understand the frustration. We understand the complaints, and sadly, they're right. We are doing everything that we can. We continue to ask for patience, but know that work is being done,"" Williams said.

In Texas, nearly 390,000 people are still under boil water advisories, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. On Feb. 19, at the height of the water crisis, nearly 15 million people across the state didn't have access to clean water, TCEQ spokesman Gary Rasp told VOX.

Houston lifted its boil water notice on Feb. 21, but thousands of homes still have no running water because of broken pipes, ABC News reported.

""Even though the power is on and the water pressure is normalized, there are thousands of homes and apartments that have been affected because of busted pipes,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a news release. ""They still do not have water, so there is a tremendous need.""

About 50 miles to the southwest in Wharton, Texas, 73-year-old Helen McCanick is searching for parts to repair her water system, but parts are in short supply.

141,13-Mar-21,NBC News,"A month without water: In Jackson, Mississippi, struggling residents fear next outage","JACKSON, Miss. — The power was out, the temperature was in the low 20s and the roads bordered on impassable when Vince Gordon lost water at his south Jackson home in mid-February.

His family hunkered down with a generator, and the reserve of water they’d bought in preparation for the winter storm. By the end of the week, the ice had thawed. But when they checked the faucet, nothing came out.

For much of the city, it stayed that way for three weeks. And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city’s water service had been restored, the crisis isn’t over.

At the Global Connection Learning Center, a day care serving 59 children, there’s still tape over the sinks to make sure children don’t use them, as much of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice. Staff members wash the toddlers’ hands and the center's dishes with bottled water instead. Nancy Sylvester, the center’s director, takes bibs and cot covers to her home in nearby Clinton to launder them.

At the height of the crisis, at least 40,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring Byram were estimated to have lost water service. While locals are no longer melting snow or collecting rainwater in buckets to have the ability to flush toilets, officials have not yet been able to prove that most of the city’s water is safe to drink. For many residents, frequenting water giveaways has become a part of their daily routine.

Life these days is about “just getting water and trying to make it work,” said south Jackson resident Alonzo Mabry, who has been scouring the city for free bottled water for his 94-year-old mother, who is bedridden.

Officials hope to begin lifting the boil-water notice by next week, but challenges remain. Absent an overhaul of what Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba has called “peanut brittle”-like infrastructure, and the hundreds of millions of dollars to make it happen, the threat of the next outage looms.

Although previous cold snaps have caused water main breaks, locals say this year’s outage is one of the worst in recent history. Danyelle Holmes, a field director with the Poor People’s Campaign and a Jackson resident, spent much of the past month helping distribute water in the city. She’d seen commercials by international charities showing families and young children filling up buckets and jugs with water. Now this was happening at home.

Holmes is not surprised that the infrastructure in a city where some of the pipes predate the Great Depression “went sour.”

Jackson is a city with an estimated $2 billion infrastructure problem — the cost of overdue water and sewer overhauls — and a $300 million annual budget. Twenty-five percent of residents in Jackson live below the poverty line. The city’s median income is just below $39,000. Although it’s Mississippi’s largest city, Jackson, where 82 percent of residents are Black, has struggled. Decades of white flight have whittled down the city’s economic footing.

“All of this happened to individuals at no fault of their own and yet they have to suffer,” she said.

For years, the city has struggled to collect overdue water bills from residents, while locals have reported receiving astronomical bills of $1,000 or more. In 2014, voters approved an additional 1 percent sales tax to make improvements. That’s brought the city $13 million to $15 million a year for improvements, but it still falls short.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday that his top priority is making sure residents have safe running water again. But he’s also spent time lobbying for funding from the state that could help prevent future crises.

“We’re not done yet,” he said.

The city’s latest chapter in a long history of infrastructure woes started Feb. 15, when a winter storm pummeled Mississippi and much of the South.

In Jackson, critical machinery froze at the city’s water plant. A precipitous drop in water pressure followed, further taxing the city’s water supply as residents kept their faucets dripping in an attempt to prevent pipes from freezing. The gradual return of pressure as temperatures warmed up proved too much for Jackson’s system to handle. Nearly 100 confirmed water breaks in the city followed, creating another setback in efforts to restore water supply.

A coalition of grassroots groups formed a rapid response team to supply water to residents. Organizers also provided cash assistance to locals who had missed work because of the storm or struggled to replace groceries that spoiled when the electricity went out.

Natt Offiah, a volunteer for the effort, monitored the group’s hotline. One woman who called over several days for help was incredulous when she learned the group wasn’t part of a government-led response. Pipes had burst in her home and she was desperate for assistance to stay in a hotel. As the group worked to collect donations to put her up, she told Offiah she’d never heard of a state or federal agency using methods like Cash App to deliver relief funds. She asked if they were a scam.

“I thought this was the government. Do you know if the state is doing anything?” she asked Offiah.

Almost a week would pass before the National Guard arrived to distribute water.

“Right now, we all we got,” Offiah told her, recalling that “her mood changed from anger to frustration to a bit of shock. The disappointment was pointed toward the lack of state response.”

Bailey Martin, a spokeswoman for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves’ office, said the governor had fulfilled several requests made by Hinds County, where Jackson is located, including for water delivery. Reeves, a Republican, signed an executive order on Feb. 23 to deploy the National Guard once local officials made the request, Martin said. Members arrived with four tanker trucks the next day.

She added that Reeves ""couldn't be more proud"" of the work the National Guard and the state's emergency management agency have done over the past 13 months.

Before the recent storm, many residents say a deep freeze in 2018 was a warning shot. Frigid temperatures caused a streak of water main breaks, leaving some locals without water for the week. The event also shut down the city’s schools for several days. Many of the district’s campuses lacked enough water pressure to flush toilets or heat up buildings.

That same month, the city council signaled their support for potential litigation against a private company charged with upgrading the city's water billing system, resulting in an eventual settlement in 2020. Jackson received about $60 million in funds, but steep expenses remain. The past few weeks have further exposed the fragility of the city’s water system.

As crews worked to restore service, Lumumba and the city’s legislative delegation began lobbying top officials in the state for a reprieve. Lumumba drafted a letter to the state’s Republican leadership and the congressional delegation, requesting $47 million in aid.

Another option, introduced by state Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, would allow the city to bring another tax increase before voters for repairs. But the legislation must pass both chambers and cross Reeves' desk before becoming law. As the April 4 end date of the legislative session approaches, it’s unclear if lawmakers will take action.

The city has submitted a damage assessment of $16 million in hopes of securing federal relief. Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor’s office, said officials anticipate sending a supplemental request as further costs are determined.

Williams expressed hope Thursday that funds from the latest Covid-19 relief package recently signed by President Joe Biden would trickle down to Jackson and provide a start.

In the meantime, some residents, like Holmes, aren’t waiting for a solution to be sketched out. Climate change that has pushed hotter summers and harsher winters in the region, she said, means the city’s system will be hit again. She’s already discussing with organizers how to prepare for the next one.

“We can never say, ‘we won’t see this day again,’” she said. “We know the next time we experience this, it will be worse.”","And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city’s water service had been restored, the crisis isn’t over.

Services across the South remain fragile or in a damaged state. Despite the restoration of water service, Jackson officials have maintained a boil-water advisory long after the extreme weather has dissipated, affecting more than 70 percent of residents.

The boil-water notice has remained, preventing thousands of residents from using water for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing. Leaks and breaks in watermains caused by the freezing weather depleted the city’s water supply, cutting service for many weeks. Surface water samples are being sent to the Mississippi State Health Department (MSHD) this week to determine whether the boil-water advisory may be lifted.

No fewer than 120 samples from various locations throughout the city will need to pass the sampling tests for two consecutive days for the boil-water notice to be lifted. However, the city lifted a precautionary boil-water notice for the 16,000 connections served by the Jackson Maddox Well System last week on Wednesday.

At the peak of the crisis, approximately 160,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring cities like Clinton, Pearl and Byram were estimated to have lost water service. This was due to water pressure plummeting from its proper working level of 80 to 90 pounds per square inch (psi) to 37 psi. According to city officials, the water pressure has returned to normal. As the city has yet to prove that most of its water is safe for consumption residents remain reliant upon charity and donations from neighboring cities and states.

The antiquated water system in Mississippi’s capital city, which has components over a century old, was found in 2016 to have elevated levels of lead, prompting comparisons to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Century-old pipes have been left vulnerable to extreme cold snaps, despite decades of warnings by engineers and climate scientists.

The lack of weatherization, winterization and modernization of such essential utilities negatively impacted 4.5 million Texans during the deep-freeze, which essentially crippled Texas’s electric grid and water systems, leaving said millions bereft of heat or drinkable water. Like many cities in Texas, pipes in Jackson city were bursting, leaving behind millions in damages.

Mississippi is the most impoverished state in the country with a poverty rate of 19.7 percent, according to an annual report by the U S News & World Report. The state also ranks among the most publicly underfunded in regard to hospital, schools and various public services. The state’s median income is $23,121, well below the national median income of $33,706. Moreover, out of the 50 states, Mississippi ranks 50th in health care, 48th in economy, 46th in education, 45th in infrastructure and 44th in fiscal stability.

Jackson’s Democratic mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, estimated that modernization of the city’s water infrastructure would cost around $2 billion. Last week, he asked Republican Governor Tate Reeves for just $47 million for repairs to the city’s derelict water system.

Reeves, declaring a state of emergency, called in the National Guard last month to aid in the distribution of water, proposing the possibility of the state assuming control over the city’s water supply. Reeves’ chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor’s office was helping the city to secure low-interest state loans to pay for modernization of its water system. White also made mention of Lumumba’s meeting with members of the Republican-dominated state legislature, including Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding for the city.

In an interview last week, Lumumba stated that he hopes to push both state and city officials in the direction of “a long-term solution.” He said, “There’s a saying that you should allow no crisis to go to waste.” He continued, “It’s crises like these that really allow us to take stock of conditions of where we are as a city, where we are as a state and hopefully it allows us to build the resolve to address it.”

However, with no significant action after then-Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency related to the city’s water and road infrastructure problems in 2015, residents can expect much of the same this time around. Bogus fixes, such as the fraudulently installed Siemens water meters, which cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and contributed to a water service shutoff crisis, are certainly in the offing.

In an interview with the New York Times, Carolyn Willis, an elderly Jackson resident, reflecting on the crisis, said, “You can’t bathe. You can’t wash.” This has increased the danger posed by the COVID-19 pandemic with sanitation, including frequent hand washing, being of the utmost importance. Mississippi has recorded 301,000 cases of coronavirus and 6,901 deaths. Jackson accounts for 19,287 cases and 397 deaths.

The conditions Jackson’s residents have been subjected to are a reflection of the malign neglect of state and federal governments. The trillions of dollars which are needed to fix the United States’ crumbling infrastructure must be expropriated from the banks and corporations and placed under the democratic control of the working class. Only with the banks and utilities placed under the common ownership and operation of workers themselves can a rational plan be worked out to prevent future catastrophes and make those who have suffered from the latest disaster whole.","The water supply in Jackson, Mississippi remains largely unusable by residents a month after a historic winter storm swept through the Southern United States.

An electrical fire at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant caused two service pumps to fail, resulting in a loss of water pressure for Jackson residents for several hours Friday morning.

The cause of the electrical fire, which was contained to a control panel in the operations room of the plant, is now under investigation, Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Armon said.

No one was injured in the fire.

Ward 6 Councilman Aaron Banks, who oversees south Jackson, said he was overwhelmed with calls from concerned residents over the water shortage. The city's monthlong water shortage that began about February 16 is still fresh on their minds, he said.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said at 1 p.m. Friday the plant was delivering about 70 pounds per square inch of pressure, which is below the 90 psi that is required for full water pressure. The danger zone is below 65 psi which is where the city was at Friday morning, causing residents to go without a shower and leaving a trickle of water from their faucets.

Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said the resulting water shortage is another reason why the city needs a backup system.

""We can't make it a couple of hours without the plant pressurizing the system,"" Stamps said. ""This is a resiliency issue that we need to tackle. We need some kind of backup for when something like this happens again.""

Friday's electrical fire comes after the plant lost power about two weeks ago, Williams said. The city is considering purchasing backup generators for both water treatment plants at a cost of $3 to $5 million if it receives water infrastructure funding it has requested. The generators would allow the pumps to function in the case of another power outage, although Williams said a generator would not have helped in Friday's fire.

The Jackson and Ridgeland fire departments responded to the call at about 3:30 a.m., Armon said. He said there was little to no structural damage from the fire. He noted electrical fires are usually caused by several factors, including old equipment, wear and tear, and an overload on the circuits.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba alluded to the outdated infrastructure and equipment at the plant at a press conference at City Hall, but said it was too early to make a connection to Friday's fire.

""I won't indicate that today's fire is based on its age, but I will say we've experienced a number of challenges at our water facilities,"" Lumumba said. ""We know that we have a number of areas that need to be repaired or upgraded, and so, we've seen this has become something we frequent far too often.""

The mayor said he is keeping the city under a state of emergency related to its water infrastructure because it is possible there will be additional issues at the plant until the city is able to fund repairs and upkeep.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil water notice. Williams said the water tanks at the plant need to be replenished before water samples can be taken. That could happen as early as Friday evening, he said.

147,19-Feb-21,The Weather Channel,7 Million Texans Without Clean Water Due To Winter Storms,"At a Glance Power outages dropped to their lowest number since Monday morning.

About 7 million people were under boil water notices.

The winter weather moved east Thursday.

Seven million Texans were under boil water advisories Thursday after a pair of deadly back-to-back winter storms brought record-low temperatures, snow and ice that knocked out power plants and caused pipes to freeze.

Many have been without both power and clean drinking water for days.

About 350,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity in Texas late Thursday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. While that's still a significant number, it's a major improvement over the 4 million outages reported Tuesday and the more than 2.5 million Wednesday night.

While power is back up for many, issues with municipal water supplies continue. More than 7 million people in Texas – or one-fourth of the population – were under boil water notices, according to The Associated Press.

""We were prepared, we thought,"" Austin resident Mariette Hummel told weather.com in an interview Wednesday. ""We had some wood, some starter logs – as much as we could get. We had some gallons of water and some food. But we were not prepared for days and days of no power and no heat.""

(MORE: Latest Winter Storm Forecast)

Hummel was hunkered down with her 7-year-old son. As of Wednesday afternoon, they'd been without power for 60 hours, and without water for over a day. They were hoping the snow they piled up in their bathtub would melt, but so far it was too cold in the house for that to happen.

""I’ve never seen anything like this,"" Hummel said. ""It’s staggering, to be honest. And we’re just trying to make it through.""

Photos circulated on social media of icicles that formed on a ceiling fan inside a home. Grocery stores, if they're open, have long lines and empty shelves. People waited in line for hours to fill propane tanks. Hospitals struggled in the face of outages and at least one major airport shut down.

At least 20 deaths are believed to be connected to the weather this week in Texas, in addition to at least 18 others in 11 different states.

Here's a look at some of the major impacts from the back-to-back storms, named Uri and Viola by The Weather Channel.

The Weather’s Deadly Toll

From carbon monoxide poisoning to falls to car crashes to exposure, more than three dozen deaths have been connected to the extreme winter weather, according to the AP.

One of the deaths in Texas happened Monday night when 23-year-old Kevin Ayala used a generator inside to try to keep the home warm for his wife and young son, KXAS-TV reported. At least two others have died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Texas. Four people died in a house fire while their power was out, while others died from car crashes or exposure.

The Louisiana Department of Health reported three weather-related deaths. The latest was a 77-year-old man who drowned after he slipped and fell into a swimming pool in Calcasieu Parish. In Lafayette Parish, a 74-year-old woman died from exposure after she wandered away from her home and a 50-year-old man slipped on ice and hit his head.

A man was found dead Tuesday in a snowbank in northwest Indiana, according to the Porter County Sheriff's Office.

A 25-year-old woman was found dead in a mobile home with no electricity or heat in western Kentucky. Another person in Kentucky died of carbon monoxide poisoning, and a third was killed in a car crash.

Arkansas resident Jessie Roberts, 69, died as he attempted to save a calf stranded on an icy pond at his farm, the Logan County Sheriff's Office said.

In Illinois, one person was killed and another injured when an awning at an off-track betting site collapsed under the weight of snow, according to the Chicago Fire Department.

Other deaths included vehicle crashes in Tennessee and Missouri, a man who fell through ice in Oklahoma, a child who fell through ice in Tennessee, three people who died in a tornado Monday night in North Carolina and four who died from carbon monoxide poisoning over the weekend in Oregon.

Water Outages

Residents in Houston, Austin and several other cities were still under boil water advisories – if water was available at all – as of late Thursday afternoon.

The situation was affecting not just households and businesses but also schools, fire stations and health care facilities.

Hospitals in Austin, for example, were stressed by the outages.

""Because this is a statewide emergency situation that is also impacting other hospitals within the Austin area, no one hospital currently has the capacity to accept transport of a large number of patients,"" St. David's South Austin Medical Center CEO David Huffstutler said in a statement, according to the AP.

Advertisement St. David’s transferred some patients to different hospitals and discharged others after water pressure was lost Wednesday, according to KXAN-TV. Huffstutler told the station that the hospital was also losing heat because water feeds the facility’s boiler.

(MORE: Cold Weather Doesn't Mean Climate Change Isn't Happening)

Officials noted that it was hard to know exactly how many people were completely without water.

Austin Water Director Greg Meszaros estimated the number in his city was ""tens of thousands,"" according to KUT-Radio.

Residents were advised to make sure they know how to shut off their water in case pipes start leaking when it comes back on.

The water issues stem from frozen water lines, power outages that took water plants offline, and a large number of people leaving their faucets dripping. The boil water notices are necessary because whenever water pressure drops there is a chance that groundwater could get into the system, Meszaros said.

Houston's William P. Hobby Airport reopened Thursday morning after being shut down due to a lack of water.

Water outages plagued other states as well.

Louisiana was struggling with 36 water outages in 18 parishes Wednesday night, according to a news release from Gov. Jon Bel Edwards. More than 175 boil water notices were in effect in 39 parishes. In all, more than 1 million people were affected, the governor said.

Edwards sent a letter to the White House requesting an emergency declaration. The state is also grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, as well as still recovering from multiple hurricanes that hit the state last year. Five named storms made landfall in Louisiana, and three of them made NOAA's list of 2021 billion-dollar disasters.

Power Outages

More than 800,000 homes and businesses were still without power in eight states, according to poweroutage.us.

Besides Texas, the states with the most outages as of about 6 p.m. EST Thursday were Mississippi with more than 135,000; Louisiana with about 100,000; Oregon with 89,000; Kentucky with 70,000; and West Virginia with about 60,000. Widespread outages were also still being reported in Virginia, Alabama and Ohio.

In some areas, power was restored after snow and ice earlier in the week, only to be knocked out again.

Many of the outages, especially in Texas, were the result of frozen equipment at power plants and increased demand that forced rotating power outages to keep the grid from shutting down completely. Officials there said the outages that remained Thursday evening were the result of ice and tree damage.

Other Impacts

While the first storm, Uri, is no longer, Winter Storm Viola has dumped several inches of snow in parts of the mid-Atlantic and East and caused ice accumulations in Virginia and North Carolina Thursday.

The governors of North Carolina and Oklahoma have requested federal emergency declarations.

The snow and ice weakened structures and led to hazardous driving conditions.

The top deck of a parking garage collapsed Thursday monring in Lexington, Kentucky, WKYT-TV reported.

In Tennesssee, 12 people were rescued from boats after a dock on the Cumberland River collapsed under the weight of ice and snow, the Nashville Fire Department said in a news release.

The 100-yard dock was already in the water when crews arrived. Boat and dive crews found 12 people in vessels that were sinking and/or taking water. All were safely rescued.

Two airports in Jackson, Mississippi, are shut down due to ice. The Jackson Municipal Airport Authority said Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport and Hawkins field will remain closed until at least Friday.

Air travel also continued to be impacted at several major destinations, according to FlightAware. At least 689 flights are canceled today at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, more than 200 each at Baltimore/Washington and Washington Dulles, and more than 100 at LaGuardia.

Schools in several districts in the Washington, D.C., area canceled classes Thursday, including Anne Arundel, Arlington, Berkeley and Charles counties.

The CDC said the weather is causing delays in the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines. Some states have shut down vaccination sites and testing centers.

149,5-Mar-21,ABC News,"Water slowly returns to Jackson, Mississippi residents but boil order remains","“Residents that lost pressure yesterday have seen water return,"" officials said.

Water is slowly returning to homes in Jackson, Mississippi, but a boil water order remains for the city's more than 160,000 residents, officials announced.

The city is still struggling to restore water after the state was ravaged by winter storms three weeks ago. The storms crippled the city's water treatment plants due to freezing temperatures and led water pressure to drop when the plants went unused for so long.

On Thursday, city officials offered a message of hope, announcing the city's water pressure recovered overnight and water started flowing in the system again.

""Water is flowing in the system. Our tanks are being filled,"" city officials said in a statement shared with ABC News. ""Residents that lost pressure yesterday have seen water return.""

Jackson's public works director Charles Williams said the state's water system is at 85 psi, or pounds per square inch, compared to about 50 psi Wednesday. The goal is for the system to reach a consistent 90 psi, officials said.

Williams said in a city update Wednesday about a fourth of Jackson's customers remained without running water. That is more than 10,000 connections, meaning water lines or pipes connected to a distribution supply main, with most serving multiple people, Associated Press reported.

However, there are still some pockets in the city continuing to struggle without running water.

""I pray it comes back on,"" Jackson resident Nita Smith said to AP. ""I'm not sure how much more of this we can take.""

Jackson officials said they're working with ""contractors and vendors to investigate solutions and triple check everything from hydrants to valves in order to get everyone fully restored and avoid any further setbacks.""

Officials said the next step in the water recovery effort is to fill tanks enough to sample the water to determine if it's safe to remove boil water notices.

Mississippi declared a statement of emergency in wake of the storm. Gov. Tate Reeves deployed the National Guard and said Thursday that 526,098 water bottles and several tankers of non-potable water were delivered to Jackson residents in need.

150,5-Mar-21,PBS,Some Mississippi residents still without water after three weeks,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Fewer than 5,000 water customers were still without service Friday afternoon in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson — a development a top official called “positive progress” for the city of 160,000, where some residents have been without water for three weeks.

“It’s been a good day, and we want to continue this trend through the weekend,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said during a Friday news conference.

Williams said almost 42,000 city water customers have now had their water restored. He said he hopes to see service restored to most customers in Jackson by Monday.

Resident Nita Smith and her mother were still without water Friday, marking three weeks since they first lost service.

Smith’s mother has diabetes and doesn’t drive. She’s had to help her mother and the other older people on her street get access to water to clean themselves and flush toilets.

“I feel like the city of Jackson put its residents under a lot of unnecessary stress,” she said Friday. “It’s very scary to know that you don’t have any water.”

Smith said she’s hopeful that with the progress the city has made in recent days, they’ll see water service restored soon.

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, had been without water at two of his businesses for more than two weeks. Finally, one got water back Thursday. The other got it Friday.

“WE WILL OPEN SATURDAY MORNING FOR BREAKFAST!” he posted Friday on the Facebook page for Broad Street Bakery and Cafe. “After 17 days without water, we are thankful to announce we are finally reopening on Saturday morning.”

The water shortage in Jackson occurred after a winter storm passed through the region three weeks ago, freezing machinery at the water treatment plant. When it began to thaw, dozens of water mains broke.

The outage left people in the majority-Black city, where close to 30% of residents live in poverty, scrambling to find water to flush toilets, bathe and drink. The National Guard was called in to assist at water distribution sites, where people waited for hours in lines of vehicles to fill buckets and bowls with water.

A key focus to recovery has been filling the system’s water tanks. Williams said earlier in the week that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into the treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

Williams said Friday the storage tanks were filling up. He said after 48 hours of consistent water flow, the city can start sampling the water to see about lifting the boil water notice, which has been in effect since Feb. 16.

City workers are still repairing water main breaks. Around 70 have been patched during the last three weeks, according to a news release.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said that the water crisis has been caused in part because of decades of neglect regarding the city’s aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson’s water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor impacting the city’s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base due to white flight. Jackson’s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools. The city was 60% white in 1970, according to U.S. census data. In 2021, it is more than 80% Black.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

On Wednesday, Lumumba penned a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves and other state and federal leaders asking for $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system.

“These improvements are critical to our efforts to ensure that our residents and businesses are not deprived of clean water again,” he wrote.

Lumumba said Friday that government officials have been talking about a national infrastructure package for a while, but not enough action has been taken.

“The time for talk is done,” he told The Associated Press. “You know, it’s over with. We have to really, you know, bring it into fruition and get the money to where the rubber meets the road, and I think that not only do we need to talk about that infrastructure package, but we have to talk about its direct pipeline to the places that need it most.”","(AP) — Fewer than 5,000 water customers were still without service Friday afternoon in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson — a development a top official called “positive progress” for the city of 160,000, where some residents have been without water for three weeks.

It’s been weeks and the people of Jackson, Mississippi, still don’t have clean drinking water.

The residents of Jackson have been waiting in long lines to get safe drinking water after record-low temperatures caused issues with the city's water system and dozens of pipes to burst. The storm left many without running water of any kind. The National Guard and other volunteers are distributing non-potable water just so families can flush their toilets. Volunteers have been forced to turn families away when pallets of drinking water run out.

The National Guard, nonprofits, and other volunteers have been doing all they can to keep families safe, but resources are limited. City and state officials have also been working hard to address the problem, but this winter storm shouldn’t have caught anyone off guard.

Politicians have been ignoring the problem of our crumbling drinking-water infrastructure for decades. The American Society of Civil Engineers has consistently sounded the alarm to warn lawmakers that our roads, bridges, and pipelines need attention.

According to the ASCE’s most recent report, a water main breaks in the United States every two minutes. During the recent winter storm, Jackson had dozens of water mains break within a few days.

For subscribers: 'Where's the cavalry?' Mississippi's capital city in water crisis

When water mains break, the system loses pressure. As pressure drops, the water can be contaminated with pathogens that cause illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7.2 million Americans get sick each year from waterborne illnesses. A loss of water pressure also allows the growth of biofilm, a pathogen-filled sludge responsible for thousands of deaths per year.

This storm clearly caught Mississippi — and its neighboring states — off guard. Few could have predicted that the temperatures would hit record-lows. But it would have been easy to predict that Jackson would have one of the biggest problems if a cold-snap struck the city.

In January, before the February winter storm, several parts of the city were without water because low temperatures caused water main breaks. According to a 2018 report from the Environmental Protection Agency, Mississippi had nearly 6,000 incidents where contaminants were spotted in the tap water. Still, Jackson was not prepared for this catastrophe.

Opinion: Forget finger-pointing: Jackson water crisis demands unity to secure resources

But it is not an easy or quick problem to fix. It can take months — if not years — to replace major water infrastructure. Moreover, none of these projects will be able to start unless lawmakers agree to address the failing infrastructure throughout the country — something that doesn’t seem like a top priority given the pandemic.

Families in Mississippi must take their safety into their own hands. FEMA recommends that families store one gallon of bottled water, per person, per day with enough water to last every member of the household for two weeks in case of emergencies. That may seem like a lot of water, but the residents of Jackson now know that having a two-week supply of bottled water for drinking, cooking, and sanitation is essential.

Hopefully, lawmakers will see the struggles of people in Jackson as a tipping point and they will put forward the proper effort to address the failing tap water system in the state. Until then, families should do what they can to protect themselves from future outages.

152,23-Feb-21,WJTV,Jackson mayor responds to water outage criticism,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba held a news conference on Tuesday to give an update on the city’s response to low water pressure after last week’s winter storms.

The mayor said the water crisis was an “act of God” and not a failure of his administration or any individual. Lumumba also spoke out against what he called misinformation from Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

“We’ve done everything we could to secure tankers and was doing that before his rant. He talked about the tanker that was in South Jackson but failed to mention that it was the administration that is paying for that tanker. It is the administration that had the agreement with the tanker,” said Lumumba. “We’re leaving from council meetings distributing water to everybody across the city.”

Stokes is expected to address the mayor’s remarks during a news conference on Wednesday.

Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3. The tanker is located at 3200 Bailey Avenue, and it will be available from 11:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 23.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams said there were up to 28 water main breaks in the city. So far, 10 breaks have been repaired. He expects the water issues to be resolved by the end of the week.

Neighbors in South Jackson tend to get hit the hardest when the city has water issues. On TV Road, there is a booster station that used to be filled with water from 2014 to 2017. Now, it’s empty. Dr. Williams said it cannot be used until it reaches health standards.

“Not right now. We’re still in a compliance issue with the State Health Department, and until we can satisfy those compliance issues, we will not be able to use that booster station,” he stated.

There’s no timeframe on when the compliance issues at the booster station will be fixed.

Leaders said the volume of calls to 311 continues to overwhelm the system. They’re asking neighbors to reserve calls for visible water leaks and urgent needs for assistance. In addition to 311, neighbors can also call 601-960-1111 or 601-960-1778.

The Water Sewer Business Administration lobby will be temporarily closed starting February 23 until water is restored to the building. Customers will have multiple options to be able to pay bills.","Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3.

154,28-Feb-21,Jackson Free Press,"Jackson Water Update: Feb. 28, 2021","The following is a verbatim statement from the City of Jackson.

(JACKSON, MS) – The City of Jackson is issuing the following updates for Saturday, February 27, 2021, related to the ongoing water outages and recovery efforts being made as a result of recent winter weather:

WATER PRESSURE

We had a very good day on Friday, but today the City’s water distribution system struggled to maintain consistent pressure. Pressure levels fluctuated throughout the day reaching a psi in the high 70s, but failed to maintain a consistent enough pressure to allow sustainable flow throughout the city.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP. Today’s reading is up from 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

We are investigating potential causes, testing solutions and looking to see if there are any new leaks in the system. We are hoping to have a better day tomorrow and see some sustainable flows throughout the city.

Overall, progress has been made from where we were and we want to remain encouraged. We know that many have seen their water restored. However, there continues to be pockets throughout the city, particularly in South Jackson and other areas of higher elevation that continue to struggle. This will unfortunately continue to be the situation until we can get our tanks to maintain a certain level of water and pressure throughout the system to be consistent.

The City’s Water Maintenance Department has completed a number of repairs to water main breaks/leaks and continues to dwindle the list down. A comprehensive list of confirmed, unconfirmed, and repaired water main breaks/leaks is at the end of this release. Please report any water main breaks to 311.

The system-wide precautionary boil water notice is still in effect.

PLEASE CONSERVE WATER during this water outage crisis. Limit water usage to the necessities. Conserving water will allow fellow Jacksonians to get back online faster.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

A water outage in Jackson has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

How did it happen? Here's what to know:

Feb. 16: Winter weather and icy temperatures choked equipment at the city's water treatment plants, rendering water pressure inadequate. It caused nearly 43,000 water customers in Jackson to be placed under a boil-water advisory.

Sanitizing water without electricity: Mississippians without power might not be able to boil water, but they can disinfect it. Here's how.

Feb. 18: City of Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced the capital city did not have a definitive timeline for total water restoration. Public Works Director Charles Williams noted water main breaks popping up that were further complicating the process of getting water to residents. Water distribution sites began to lace the city, and fire stations made available non-potable water for residents.

Feb. 22: The state health department recorded 300,000 customers under boil water advisories across Mississippi.

Convenience and grocery stores across the city saw a surge in demand for bottled water as many residents did not have running of safe water. Their supplies began to run low. City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the city provided over 26,500 bottles of water and around 7,000 gallons of non-potable water.

Feb 23: Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd lent more help to Jackson water customers by securing tankers to provide non-potable water. He also activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.

Feb 24: City Officials say most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week. But they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays. Ten water distribution sites pop up around Jackson.

Feb. 25: Public Works Director Charles Williams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed the plants to pump out more water. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.

Residents reflect: 'We're just not built for this down here': Jackson water crisis is latest chapter in decades-long saga

March 1: Public Works Director Charles Williams said the city's water system was still stabilizing itself and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had since fallen. South Jackson residents continue to struggle with a lack of water and water pressure.

Up to 80 water main breaks were reported between the time the storm hit and March 1. City workers continue to mend the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials man water distribution sites throughout the city.

The Water System Business Administration announced it will offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.

March 2: City officials say they do not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration. Williams, the public works director, explained south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.

March 3: Water intake filters full of clams, mussels, other fish and items force systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had recently seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.

Williams confirms more than 10,000 of the city's water customers did not have any water. The city's aging water infrastructure is the main reason for failure, he said.

March 4: Local media outlets get hold of an email Lumumba sent to Reeves on March 3. Lumumba requested about $47 million in emergency funding from the state and federal government to cover a wide range of projects relating to water system infrastructure.

156,22-Feb-21,WSWS,"Jackson, Mississippi’s public water system collapses after winter storm’s deep freeze","City officials in Jackson, Mississippi reported late last week that water service had been knocked out indefinitely for most of the city after a devastating winter storm shut down power and froze water lines, resulting in a drop in water pressure last week.

Icy weather conditions created power outages last week for much of the South, including many areas of Texas where freezing temperatures and lack of power have resulted in dozens of deaths. Of the many cities across the Southern US devastated by freezing temperatures last week, Jackson, Mississippi’s capital and largest city with 160,000 residents, is among the worst hit.

Water main breaks constitute a major cause for concern, with Jackson experiencing 13 breaks in less than a week. Pressure drops and outages and boil water advisories were rampant across the state as the region’s old and poorly maintained infrastructure struggled to function under adverse weather conditions. Many of the city’s water mains and pipes have not been replaced in decades, with some piping being over 100 years old.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told reporters on Thursday, “We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.

“This becomes increasingly challenging due to the pandemic,” Lumumba said. He attempted to blame the outage on COVID-19 restrictions and the closure of schools, claiming, “so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.”

However, severe winter weather has caused a strain on Jackson’s infrastructure in the recent past, and it is well known that a significant investment in the city’s water system is overdue.

During a period of freezing cold temperatures in 2014-15, then Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency in an attempt to secure federal funding to update city water mains and roads. Back in 2015 it was estimated by city officials that somewhere between $750 million to $1 billion would be needed to fully replace or repair the city’s water mains and roads. Mayor Yarber filed a request for a paltry $2.5 million in repairs as the city’s water system crumbled.

“Our infrastructure is not prepared to handle this,” Lumumba admitted on Thursday. Many people have been without water since Monday. Residents have resorted to gathering snow to melt to create enough water to flush their toilets.

The city set up stations at fire houses, some schools, a mall and other sporadic locations to hand out bottles and jugs of water to people able to go out in the cold and wait, a difficult task for the region’s elderly and infirm residents.

Icy roads have prevented water treatment crews from receiving delivery of much needed chemicals to ensure the water being pumped into the city tanks is safe for use. As it stands, there remains a citywide boil water advisory, with residents who have water flowing from their taps instructed to boil their water before use to ensure potability.

As of Thursday, at least 221,000 homes across Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi were still without power. Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards stated on Thursday that there were at least one million residents under a boil water advisory, as well as another 245,000 facing water outages entirely.

Betsy Sawyer, a resident of Vidalia in the northeast of Louisiana, spoke to the Associated Press (AP) about having to deal with power and water outages in her area. “We knew that the water was going to be shut off so we filled the bathtub up with water,” she explained. “Everybody’s scrambling, just doing their best.” Sawyer said she had very low water pressure and was keeping warm using the burners on her stove.

Desperate residents in Louisiana and Mississippi waited for hours in order to claim water handouts at various city government sites. “A lot of people have been giving up—they’re tired of waiting,” Paul Lee Davis told the AP, as he waited in line at a distribution site in Jackson. “I’ve been here so long, I figure I might as well wait it out. We need water. The stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have.”

Nicole Beard, a resident of Hackberry, Louisiana, told the AP how her hot water pipe burst and days later the water main burst, cutting off water to her area completely. Beard, who had to leave her home last year after it was destroyed by Hurricane Laura, explained that many in her community have still not fully recovered from that devastating storm six months ago. “People are still just struggling over here,” she said.","Water main breaks constitute a major cause for concern, with Jackson experiencing 13 breaks in less than a week.

157,1-Mar-21,CBS News,"Jackson, Mississippi, residents remain without water for more than 2 weeks after storm","Winter storms that passed through the South last month caused long-term damage in several states, with millions in Texas without power and water for days. While the focus was on the Lone Star State, Jackson, Mississippi continues to suffer from storm-related issues as well.

In anticipation of a storm on February 14, Mississippi Governor Reeves and Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann declared a state of emergency. The storm left thousands in the state without power, which has since been nearly fully restored.

However, Jackson is still feeling the effects of the storm, with a boil water notice still in place, more than two weeks after the snowstorm. Reeves also activated the National Guard to help with water distribution efforts in the area. And the city has set up several sites for distribution of non-potable or flushing water this week.

""Over the course of this crisis, 80 total water main breaks/ leaks have been reported throughout the City,"" according to a press release from the city. As of Sunday evening, 51 repairs had been completed by the Water Maintenance Department, which was continuing to work on repairs.

In addition to boiling water during the crisis, residents are also being asked to limit their usage of water. A representative for the city of Jackson told CBS News that it is unclear how many people were without water, as the system — which services 43,000 customers — is old. The way the city counts and records water outages is by people calling them in.

In a press conference about the city's water supply on Sunday, Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the lack of water is an issue of health and sanitation. ""We have seen several areas that have been without water that are starting to see water, but we are certainly nowhere near ready to claim victory until every single resident has the restoration of their water,"" Lumumba said.

City engineer Dr. Charles Williams said Sunday was a ""much better day"" than the previous one. ""The complex nature of it is, our system crashed, like a computer, and now we're trying to rebuild it,"" he said. ""And so, the progress has been very slow.""

Williams said once water tanks throughout the city are refilled using water supplies from two plants, city officials will focus on lifting water boil notices.

""I know residents are trying to understand this process and be patient — they just want to see water,"" Lumumba said. ""I think it's important to start with the understanding that what we have faced and what we have seen as a result of the winter storm, water treatment facilities are not meant to shut down at the level that we experienced.""

Broken water mains in Jackson, Mississippi, have played havoc with residences and many businesses and restaurants, such as Barrelhouse in the historic Fondren business district on Tuesday, February 23, 2021. Rogelio V. Solis / AP

Lumumba said because the water facilities shut down, ""the process of getting it moving back to where it was before the storm is a difficult recovery process."" The mayor also said that Jackson is a ""legacy city"" and it needs long-term support to deal with the water issue ""that has gone decades without being addressed sufficiently.""

He said Jackson is an ""aging city with an aging budget"" with about a $300 million annual budget and ""more than likely, a more than $2 billion issue with our infrastructure."" He did not specify a timeline for when water would be restored. CBS News has reached out to Lumumba, Williams and the city's council and public works department for statement or comment and is awaiting response.

Last week, city council member Kenny Stokes criticized Lumumba's response to the storms, saying during a news conference on Wednesday that the ""City of Jackson has suffered unduly because of the rookie mistakes of the mayor.""

This came after Lumumba said during a city council meeting a week ago that Stokes spread misinformation about the relief efforts following the storm.

Lumumba also defended his administration's response to the crisis during a press conference Tuesday: ""We offer as proof of the fact that this is an act of God is you just simply have to look at all of the places that this weather affected, and the fact that communities are experiencing the same trauma that our residents are experiencing today — Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas Canton, Mississippi, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Louisiana, and many more.

""It was an act of God, extreme weather, that sent old systems into havoc and put our residents in trauma,"" Lumumba said. ""In moments of crisis, the first casualty is trust, which is why I'm calling up not only the media, but our council people."" He then said ""misinformation"" had been spread.

During his press conference, Stokes refuted Lumumba's claims that he had spread misinformation, saying: ""Tell me one thing that I said that was wrong. I showed you the people who have no water. I showed you the people who can't flush toilets.""

CBS News has reached out to Lumumba and Stokes for comment on this and is awaiting response.

While city officials argued in the press, Jackson residents and many others posted their frustrations with the situation on social media. ""Trying not to complain but this is so wild. Tomorrow will be the beginning of the third week that I and so many others in Jackson have been without water. I'm not blaming anybody because these problems pre-date our leadership,"" Arekia S. Bennett, a teacher and director of Mississippi Votes, tweeted.

Bennett also shared a link to the non-profit Shower Power, a mobile shower unit brought to cities in need. Shower Power will be in Jackson to provide clean showers to people without water.

""The entire city of Jackson, Mississippi, either has no water or is under a boil water alert. It's been 2 weeks now, going on week 3. Why isn't this getting the attention Texas got?"" another resident tweeted.

Activist Erin Brockovich also tweeted about the water issues: ""Big money but bad or no water!! Jackson, Mississippi, has been without water for a week.""

""Not only was the city's water treatment plant knocked offline but the governor has dispatched the National Guard to bring water to the city's 160,000 residents,"" she wrote.

""How is it that the people of a state's capital city in the richest nation on earth have been without running water for two weeks now? How is it that there are no ongoing conversations between Mississippi's governor/legislature and Jackson's mayor? Jackson is 82% Black,"" Ashton Pittman, senior reporter for the Mississippi Free Press, tweeted.","While the focus was on the Lone Star State, Jackson, Mississippi continues to suffer from storm-related issues as well.

Temperatures will start to warm in the region Friday, but forecasters are warning residents that the danger presented by two winter storm systems this week hasn't completely passed.

The latest forecast from the National Weather Service in Jackson shows that temperatures in the Jackson area may get up to the mid 30s by Friday afternoon. In the Delta and other northwest portions of the state, residents are still not expected to get above freezing.

The outlook is better for the Pine Belt region, which could see highs in the mid to upper 40s.

A warm-up is expected this weekend, but that could lead to more problems with water systems and power grids throughout the state. More water main breaks are expected to occur, which could disrupt service to the areas in the state that still have it.

Officials in Jackson said they are working to restore water service to thousands of customers that haven't had access to running water since Monday. A definitive timeline on when work will be completed has not been released.

Entergy CEO: Company deploying hundreds of workers to restore power in Mississippi

Most Entergy electricity customers in Mississippi should have services restored by the beginning of next week, the company’s chief executive said during a virtual press conference Friday.

Speaking to reporters Friday, Entergy Mississippi President and CEO Haley Fisackerly said more than 53,000 of the company's approximately 450,000 customers are still without power, down from a peak of about 90,000 outages Wednesday.

More than 2,000 linemen and other personnel have been enlisted to help restore power in Mississippi, including workers from Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Canada.

Entergy services customers in 45 of Mississippi’s 82 counties.

Ice and COVID-19 restrictions have contributed to slower-than-normal restoration efforts, officials said. And working conditions, which include rolling terrain in more rural areas as well as power lines in metropolitan areas that were installed where work trucks cannot reach them, are forcing workers to climb icy poles.

Around noon, about 98,000 energy customers were without power across the state, according to data from PowerOutage.US. That included 17,000 in Hinds County, 1,500 in Rankin County and 2,500 in Madison County.

As power is restored across the state, Fisackerly cautioned customers to slowly phase in use to avoid overloading the system. He suggested turning off major appliances ahead of power being turned back on.

""I know when those lights come back on, you're going to be ready to clean up that house and wash those dishes in your dishwasher, or wash your clothes,"" he said. ""Do that in stages. That could create problems back on the grid but also it's not good for your home to ... overload your breakers.""

Power outages continue throughout the state

Some areas of the state are beginning to see power return Friday after bitterly cold temperatures sent energy grids offline in Mississippi.

More than 111,000 customers are without power as of Friday morning, with more than 20,000 in Hinds County alone, according to data from PowerOutage.US.

Energy companies across the state have brought in more line workers to help restore power to customers as soon as possible and work will continue Friday.

159,19-Feb-21,Newsweek,"Amid Texas' Vast Outages, Mississippi Has Over 100,000 Residents Still Without Power","Nearly 100,000 customers were still without power Friday morning in Mississippi as a result of winter storms that tore through the southern U.S. this week.

Entergy Corporation, which the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told Newsweek is one of the state's biggest energy providers, said in a Friday update that the situation was improving as it sliced the number of customers impacted by outages from about 90,000 to 55,000 by 7 a.m. local time.

According to PowerOutage.US, the number of Mississippi power customers affected by the outages was estimated to be 97,377 just before 12 p.m. on Friday. Two states away, Texas was also still struggling with widespread outages midday Friday, with an estimated 185,895 customers impacted.

Though Mississippi had nearly half the number of power outages as Texas on Friday morning, the state has about one-tenth of the Lone Star state's population, with the U.S. Census Bureau estimating Mississippi's population to be just under 3 million as of July 2019. Both states have been impacted by power and water outages as a result of the recent winter storm, which triggered offers of federal assistance from the White House earlier this week.

An estimated 13 million Texans were under boil water advisories Thursday evening, and water distribution centers were operating Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, where the city's mayor said most residents were reporting little or no water pressure on Thursday.

Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he was among those without water on Thursday. In a Twitter thread that encouraged Mississippians to assist one another and stay safely inside, he also made brief mention of how the weather was impacting him.

""My office building is flooded, while my home is without running water,"" Reeves wrote. ""Look after your loved ones and neighbors—share resources and check in.""

Hazardous driving conditions were impacting the speed of Entergy's response, the company said in its Friday morning update. ""Restoration work is proceeding as safely as possible, but dangerous driving conditions are slowing travel to damaged areas,"" the company said. Entergy added that its ""methodical and calculated process"" also meant it would take time to restore power, with company employees doing so in segments to prevent a potentially damaging surge in the power grid.

It was possible some of the state's power outages would last into next week, an Entergy spokesperson told WLBT-TV.

The National Weather Service projected temperatures would warm in Mississippi over the weekend but issued a hard freeze warning in central Mississippi starting Friday evening and extending into Saturday morning due to expected low overnight temperatures, which the organization said could drop to 17 degrees.

""Hard freeze conditions will result in damage to exposed pipes, and water main breaks are expected,"" the NWS said in its warning. ""Many power outages continue across the area leaving some without means of heating their home and increasing the risk of frozen indoor plumbing as well.""","Nearly 100,000 customers were still without power Friday morning in Mississippi as a result of winter storms that tore through the southern U.S. this week.

160,19-Feb-21,Liberation News,Snowstorm + capitalism = disaster for more than 100K in Mississippi – Liberation News,"This week, Mississippi is experiencing unprecedented freezing conditions resulting from ice storms that blasted through the U.S. South. In addition to being unaccustomed to the freezing rain, ice, and snow, thousands of Mississippians suffering rolling blackouts and power outages, unheated homes and water shutoffs, have been left to fend for themselves.

Starting Feb 15, at least 250,000 Mississippians have lost power at some point during the week; counties in the southwest to east central Mississippi are primarily impacted. About 110,000 people were still without power on Feb. 19 in the morning. Almost all of the residents of the state’s capital city, Jackson, are without water. City officials have reported lacking the necessary chemicals to treat the water, and that the distribution system is overwhelmed.

Many of those impacted are trapped in their homes, unable to travel to replenish supplies, as most Mississippians do not have experience driving on ice-covered roads. As in other impacted states, in Mississippi too there are reports of buildings flooding from frozen water pipes bursting.

Grassroot organizations attempt to fill void created by government failure

Working class people have been coming together to help each other while the state and federal governments neglect to use all the resources available to organize and implement an emergency response. In the absence of a satisfactory system, volunteers, faith-based non-profits and community organizations attempt to fill the need. Many Mississippians need water, food, and to be rehoused temporarily. In Mississippi, organizations like the People’s Advocacy Institute, Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign Black Youth Project and Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity have come together to assist people in need.

Taking personal risk by traveling on icy roads, volunteers are delivering needed supplies to those living in apartment complexes, although the task has proven to be difficult. These supplies include water, blankets, heaters, and hot food. The delivery of over 2,000 hot meals is being coordinated by the organizations engaging in mutual aid. However heroic and commendable the volunteer-based mutual aid efforts on the ground are, they fall short of being able to address the needs of hundreds of thousands of people in the state. Assistance and support from the government is crucial and missing.

Speaking with Liberation News, Calandra Davis, an organizer with Black Youth Project in Jackson, said, “We need for this [disaster] to not happen again. [The state] needs the infrastructure to ensure that we don’t need to turn the city’s water off to get through this. Even more so, [there is a need for] larger conversations around climate justice because a snowstorm of this nature didn’t come out of nowhere. Local officials need to take environmental justice seriously.”

Over the past two decades, the capitalism-fueled global climate crisis has increasingly given way to extreme weather events in the Gulf Coast. Despite being hit with storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and extreme temperatures, states like Mississippi still have an inadequate and insubstantial emergency response system in place. The extent of the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency’s response to this week’s winter storm has been limited to distribution of water bottles using 14 disaster reservists, along with listing existing shelters and safe rooms on its website.

Currently, many stores and businesses have closed in the impacted areas. Stores that are open are also running out of supplies. The shutting down of businesses has meant lost wages for workers. Speaking to this point, Davis said, “There needs to be [government aid] right now so that people’s wages and livelihood are not affected by natural disasters, or state of emergencies.”

Power outages have been disproportionately reported in predominantly Black neighborhoods in Jackson city. Additionally, Mississippi’s homeless population is in a perilous situation. In cities like Biloxi, there are no existing shelters to house people during the winter storm. In the city of Jackson, Stewpot Community Services, a faith-based non-profit organization, provided shelter to 200 homeless people in hotels and shelters. About the homelessness crisis, Davis said, “[the government] needs to make sure [all] people are housed so that we are not rushing to get the unhoused off the streets during a winter storm.”

The Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity is another grassroots organization mobilizing relief aid in Mississippi. In the U.S. economy, immigrant and migrant workers are often essential workers who are forced to work low wage jobs. They have access to even fewer resources than others when affected by pandemics or weather disasters.

IAJE’s Executive Director, Lorena Quiroz said to Liberation News, “Discrimination based on class is very real and coming into play during this disaster. Migrants are disproportionately impacted by this racism and classism.” She added, “We don’t want any undocumented or low wage migrants to be left without help, especially since people are still out of work. We need to make sure people have heat and water.”

In addition to delivering necessities, the organization helped house 10 people in hotels today, while coordinating others to share housing. Quiroz reported assisting a family with a 9-day old baby to safety. IAJE is also searching for queer and transgender migrants to assist as their ability to access essential resources during this time has been identified to be worse.

Power companies, blackouts, and expensive electric bills

In Mississippi, a patchwork of over 40 energy companies, the largest of which are privately owned, are involved in electricity provision to the state. A fortune 500 company and Mississippi’s largest electric power producer and distributer, Entergy, provides power to 450,000 Mississippians, about 50,000 of whom are currently out of power. Other providers like Southwest Mississippi EPA, South Pine electric, and Central EPA, combined have about 50,000 more customers that are currently experiencing power outage.

In 2020, Entergy increased its profits by $361 million, more than 50%, despite of the fact the pandemic year saw hundreds of thousands of working class families in Mississippi economically devastated. Like many corporate power companies across the country, Entergy has had a history of exploiting its customers. In 2008, Mississippi’s attorney general sued Entergy for overcharging customers by over $1 billion.

Across the country, working people owe up to $40 billion in debt to utility companies over the course of 2020. Thirty-two states passed utility shutoff moratoriums during the pandemic. Nationally nearly 35 million households benefitted from these protections until many of the moratoriums were allowed to expire. In 2020, Mississippi too had a utility shutoff moratorium that expired at the end of May, leaving people to choose between feeding families or paying for overpriced utilities, to avoid facing eviction. In September 2020, Mississippi allotted $9.2 million of federal grant money towards helping residents pay for electric and gas bills, but this amount is gravely insufficient given the state’s history of high utility costs.

Mississippi has the highest poverty rate among all the states in the country, but ranks in the top ten for highest monthly electricity bills. In 2019, Mississippi Power, the second largest private provider in the state, came under scrutiny when customers’ electricity bills during the summer months almost doubled in comparison to the billing cycle during the previous year, leaving people suspecting a connection between then newly installed digital meters and the outrageously high monthly bills ranging from $300 to $500.

In Mississippi and elsewhere, it is not the weather that has put the lives of so many at risk, but the decisions of millionaire executives and politicians to not invest in the appropriate infrastructure and energy sources. As in Mississippi, electric grids across country are unable to cope with extreme temperatures because they have not been updated or winterized, in this case. Water pipes can be insulated against freezing. An overreliance on fossil fuels for power production has not only worsened the environmental and climate crises but has created shortages. The U.S. government’s lack of seriousness in regulating fossil fuel use by corporations, and lack of investment in renewable energy technology, means disastrous consequences for the U.S. working class.

The unpreparedness of the utility giants, and the pathetic response of the capitalist government at the local and federal level, is nothing short of criminal neglect by those motivated solely by profit making. In contrast, a government of and by working class people would do everything in its power to avert a mass crisis such as this through preparation. That the U.S. Congress bailed out the oil and gas industry with billions of dollars of federal COVID-19 funds but has yet to act on providing material relief to the millions of working people impacted over the last week, and beyond during the pandemic, is a testament to who it truly serves. Only working class organization and mobilization against the capitalist system can turn this repugnant reality on its head.

Many Mississippians need water, food, and to be rehoused temporarily.
Speaking with Liberation News, Calandra Davis, an organizer with Black Youth Project in Jackson, said, “We need for this [disaster] to not happen again.
Despite being hit with storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, and extreme temperatures, states like Mississippi still have an inadequate and insubstantial emergency response system in place.

165,24-Feb-21,Jackson Free Press,City of Jackson Update for Tuesday Evening,"(JACKSON, MS) – The City of Jackson is issuing the following updates for Tuesday, February 23, 2021, related to the impacts of recent winter weather on the City and efforts being made:

WATER PRESSURE

Low and no water pressure is still impacting residents across Jackson, but we are continuing to see progress. The City anticipates that with pressures gaining each day, a majority of the City will see their water restored by the end of the week. We are cautious with this prediction due to possible water main breaks delaying restorative efforts. We are encouraged with the efforts of our water personnel and the response from the water system to date.

Another system-wide precautionary boil water notice was issued today due to high turbidity (cloudiness) in the water.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. Today, the City’s pressure is up to 80 psi. This is good. We are working to sustain it and residents should begin to see improvements in water pressure soon.

That is up from 67 psi yesterday and 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP.

We continue to work to assess and coordinate water main break repairs. The City encourages residents to report any water main breaks to 311.

CONFIRMED WATER MAIN BREAKS - This list has been located via MS 811 and checked by a water maintenance supervisor. These have not been repaired as of 2/23

Those with water should continue to conserve it. Please only use water for basic necessities. Residents closer to the plants will see water pressure restored soonest. It will take longer for those farther away. Conserving water will allow fellow Jacksonians to get back online faster.

We ask that residents please refrain from tampering with fire hydrants.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

A second winter storm made its way into Mississippi Wednesday and many Mississippians are dealing with the effects.

The number of power outages in Mississippi jumped from about 17,000 Wednesday morning to almost 200,000 Thursday morning.

Friday Updates: Mississippi power outages persist despite warming temperatures

Downed trees and icy conditions have forced road closures, and air travel continues to be suspended at Jackson airports.

Forecasters warned residents in the Delta, as well as the Jackson area, will likely not see highs above low to mid 30s during the day Thursday and lows could go below 20 degrees. The entire northwestern portion of the state will also see wind chill factors below 10 degrees during the nighttime hours, and hypothermia is possible with prolonged exposure, officials said.

Hang in there just a couple more days, then we promise warmer conditions and complete melting of our wintry mess. But first, very cold conditions are expected tonight and Friday night. Continue to protect yourself and your pets, and take action to avoid damage to water pipes. pic.twitter.com/YDtJ7lusUw — NWS Jackson MS (@NWSJacksonMS) February 18, 2021

More crews coming to restore power

Entergy Mississippi reported 89,000 of their customers were without power Thursday morning and said restoration is a slow process due to road conditions. The company said 180 additional resources are en route and more are being requested.

However, Entergy is notifying some customers that an estimated time for power restoration cannot be provided due to the number of outages.

Southern Pine Electric said it had 25,000 customers without power as of Thursday morning. Crews are working to restore power and an additional 120 linemen and 60 right-of-way crew members have joined the effort.

When will road conditions improve?: Not as soon as you’d like

Tips on portable generator safety

With a reported 160,000 customers without power, many Mississippians are currently using portable generators to get by until power is restored. Entergy Mississippi has offered tips on how to safely and properly use a generator.

If you're using a generator to get through a power outage, be sure to follow these basic safety guidelines. https://t.co/ZEs9CnuBGc pic.twitter.com/tJknUJYC2F — Entergy Mississippi (@EntergyMS) February 18, 2021

Reeves urges residents to stay home as weather impact continues

Gov. Tate Reeves took to Twitter Thursday to strongly encourage residents to stay home as the impact of two winter storms continue to resonate across Mississippi.

Reeves said the storm has been a slow-moving disaster in the state that has left roads impassable and affected the state's power grid. Water systems have also been disrupted across the state and left thousands without service, including Reeves himself.

""My office building is flooded, while my home is without running water,"" he said.

Record any damage, because emergency management teams will work to calculate and get federal assistance if the damage is great enough. My office building is flooded, while my home is without running water!



Look after your loved ones and neighbors—share resources and check in. — Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) February 18, 2021

The governor encouraged people who have had damage to their homes or property during the storm to document it to be assessed by the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency at a later date. Reeves also reminded residents to check on neighbors and family members who may have been impacted by the storms, but also to stay off roadways because crews are working to clear the highways of icy conditions.

""Pray for the line crews, road crews, first responders, and others who have to go out in the cold and do dangerous work to restore power, clear roads, and protect us,"" he said.

Downed trees, power outages, traffic woes

Authorities are urging people to stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary and if you are forced to drive, use extreme caution and watch for downed trees and power lines.

Tree limbs are coming down under the weight of ice causing power outages and blocking roads.

For the latest on road closures and advisories, visit mdottraffic.com.

While there may be some thawing today there is a possibility of refreezing that can occur tonight and tomorrow morning, resulting in black ice on the roads. Temperatures will be dangerously cold.

Power outages skyrocket in Mississippi

Although power has been restored to some, almost 200,000 customers throughout the state are without power.

Wednesday morning, roughly 17,000 customers in Mississippi were reported to be without power, but a second winter storm moved through Mississippi with freezing rain, sleet and snow and multiplied that number more than ten-fold. As of 7:30 a.m. Thursday, more than 195,000 customers were without power, according to PowerOutage.US. As of 12:30 p.m., 160,000 remained with power.

Entergy Mississippi issued a statement Wednesday afternoon asking customers to voluntarily reduce their usage until further notice. Freezing temperatures forced the company to utilize rolling blackouts Tuesday night as demand has surged over the past few days.

The company suggested customers lower their thermostats to 68 degrees and delay non-essential activities like doing laundry and washing dishes until the conservation period has ended.

Airport closures extended, again

The Jackson Municipal Airport Authority has once again extended the closures of Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport and Hawkins Field.

Continuing adverse weather conditions have forced multiple closure extensions this week and now flights are anticipated to resume at 11 p.m. Friday. However, authorities said if conditions don't improve by then, the closures will remain in place until conditions are safe to resume service.

Some state health departments, vaccine sites closed Thursday

The Mississippi State Department of Health has announced that only some county health departments, WIC centers and offices throughout the state will be open Thursday as cold weather continues.

Days after an uncharacteristic freeze saw snow pile up and ice cover roads across the Mid-South, multiple regions were grappling with the dangerous and, at times, deadly results of Sunday's storm — while bracing for additional precipitation the National Weather Service expected to accumulate in some areas by Thursday morning.

Louisiana and Mississippi were contending with power outages and electricity shortages, with residents in both states bearing the added burden of water utility issues.

Tennessee's two largest cities hadn't been dealt a similar level of power problems, though like Louisiana, the state has record weather-related deaths.

For select portions of Mid-South states, in the southern parts of Alabama and Louisiana, the extreme weather had relented. Or, the precipitation had at least paused, as was the case in northwest Arkansas. Elsewhere in the Mid-South, though, residents largely awaited the third round of winter weather expected to commence Wednesday.

Mississippi

From power outages and boil notices to expected water main breaks and highway closures, central Mississippi residents were contending with a host of storm-related issues — while bracing for additional freezing rain and sleet predicted through Thursday morning.

Closures included the majority of the state's vaccination sites, large stretches of interstates and highways and the Jackson airport. Drivers were urged to stay off roadways and only travel when absolutely necessary. Officials expected roads to remain hazardous until the weekend, as sub-freezing temperatures prevent ice melt or cause melted precipitation to refreeze into black ice along roads and bridges.

By early Wednesday morning, roughly 18,700 customers were without power in Mississippi, according to Poweroutage.us. The hardest-hit counties lie in a northeasterly line from Pike County to Kemper County. Counties in the northwestern part of the state have experienced significant numbers of outages as well during the storm.

In Jackson, nearly 43,000 water customers were under a boil water advisory after equipment at the city's water treatment plants was affected by the record cold, according to a press release. The city was also preparing for an expected high volume of water main breaks according to Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams.

West and Middle Tennessee

In West Tennessee, three Shelby County deaths that could have been caused by hypothermia were under investigation as the Memphis area braced for more snow Wednesday. Vaccination sites in the county are closed through Saturday. Amid the dangerous conditions schools, area schools have either closed or are holding classes virtually.

In Middle Tennessee, the bulk of the snow was expected overnight, said NWS Meteorologist Caroline Adcock.

""We're definitely going to get a dump late Wednesday night,"" Adcock said. Travel, she said, may become difficult on Thursday.

Three to four inches of snow were possible in Nashville and two to three inches were expected in other areas including Clarksville and Columbia.

Meteorologists don't expect snow to start melting in middle Tennessee until the weekend.

Alabama

Northwest Alabama remained under the National Weather Service's winter storm warning until Thursday morning. ""Snow and sleet accumulations up to 2 inches with locally higher amounts and freezing rain accumulations up to a tenth of an inch will be possible,"" the NWS Birmingham office cautioned residents of northwest counties.

But ""little impact"" from the ongoing storm was expected elsewhere in the state Wednesday, according to the NWS. High temperatures in the 40s were expected near Tuscaloosa and in the 50s near Montgomery, where the sun is back out for residents, with a chance of rain, rather than snow, later in the day.

More: Rain expected Wednesday night in Tuscaloosa, but no ice

Arkansas

Snowfall had also largely subsided in the northwest corner of Arkansas as of Wednesday. But between two to eight inches of snow was expected elsewhere across the state by Thursday morning, with the Little Rock region hit heaviest. Residents of eastern Arkansas, near Memphis, could expect between three to six inches, according to the NWS forecast.

Even without additional snowfall, where temperatures remain below freezing, vigilance is still required, said meteorologist Joe Sellers. ""The roads are still snow-covered, snow-packed, so they're going to be slick.""

Blowing snow makes for dangerous travel and buildings burdened by the weight of too much snow can be compromised, the NWS Little Rock office wrote in a winter storm advisory Wednesday effect throughout the state until Thursday.

More: Fort Smith snowpack topped with 2 inches of snow; won't melt until Thursday

Louisiana

As a ""last resort"" effort ahead of a second freeze predicted to hit northern Louisiana Wednesday, power grids in the state instituted rolling blackouts in an effort to lessen electricity shortages.

Gov. John Bel Edwards said he briefed President Joe Biden on Louisiana's weather emergency Tuesday.

“Because of extremely cold temperatures over the last several days, the demand for electricity has reached an all-time high,"" Edwards said. ""I spoke with President Biden about our ongoing challenges in Louisiana because of this severe weather, including my concerns about Louisianans facing power outages in such cold temperatures.""

More: Deep South freeze: 3 dead in Louisiana as power grids struggle with rolling blackouts

In Shreveport, the winter storm forced the closure of City Court and the cancellation of elective procedures at hospitals in the area, where the chance of snow and sleet is 100% — though it may amount to less than an inch. Although a high near 29 is expected, wind chill values will be as low as 10.

All Bossier schools and centers will remain closed for the rest of the week, including virtual classes.

Later in the day, some central Louisiana customers were told they'd need to boil their water because of low pressure plaguing the system.

174,19-Feb-21,WLBT,Jackson public works director says city is making progress in restoring water,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Jackson’s water treatment plants are back up and running following this week’s winter weather.

However, city officials are still not saying when water service will fully be restored for the 43,000 households currently with no or low water pressure.

The city’s water operations were crippled earlier this week when wintry weather ripped across the state, bringing with it sub-freezing temperatures and dropping the temperature of surface water at the Barnett Reservoir.

The frigid temperatures outside, coupled with the lower water temperatures, ground operations to a halt at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant, which provides clean, drinkable water to the vast majority of the city’s home and businesses.

Because water couldn’t be treated, the system’s reserve tanks were quickly depleted, leaving customers with little to no water.

On Friday, Curtis was back up and running and water pressure in the distribution system had been restored to about 50 pounds per square inch, said Public Works Director Charles Williams.

At 50 PSI, most residents still won’t see much of a difference at the faucet. That’s why Williams said that number has to be higher.

“The goal is to get that up,” he said. “If we can get it up to 90 PSI at Curtis and 80 PSI at Fewell, water service should be restored.”

Fewell is the J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Plant, located next to the waterworks curve.

It, too, was impacted by the cold weather. But the city had to slow down production there because it was running low on treatment chemicals.

“We got low on alum, but we were able to get a shipment in around 2 p.m. Thursday,” Williams said. “Fewell is starting to regain traction.”

Homes and businesses across the state have experienced water woes as a result of the winter weather.

In many cases, water pressure dropped when treatment plants lost power.

Residents in Crystal Springs began losing water pressure Wednesday night, after a power outage occurred at its water wells.

Meanwhile, in Natchez, the city’s water treatment system continued operating at capacity, but could not keep up as pipes across the city burst.

“This has tapped our water system. This has tapped our water supply,” Mayor Dan Gibson said in a statement on Facebook. “It will take several days for an acceptable water supply and pressure to be restored.”

In both cases, residents are being asked to check their homes for leaks and to have their water service turned off if any are found.

In Jackson, there are glimmers of hope.

During his interview with WLBT, Williams opened an email informing him water service had been restored at the Governor’s Mansion.

On Feb. 18, Gov. Tate Reeves said on social media that the mansion was without running water.

The mansion, as well as much of downtown Jackson, is served by the Fewell plant.

Record any damage, because emergency management teams will work to calculate and get federal assistance if the damage is great enough. My office building is flooded, while my home is without running water!



Look after your loved ones and neighbors—share resources and check in. — Tate Reeves (@tatereeves) February 18, 2021

Curtis serves much of the rest of the city, except for those on the well system.

However, there were still challenges. Public works was planning to issue a boil water notice for well water customers Friday, Williams said.

Williams was also bracing for the potential of burst pipes. As the ground warms up and shifts, the city’s aging water distribution lines will likely burst, causing pressure in the system to again drop.

Following severe winter weather in 2010, more than 200 mains burst. In 2018, an even more severe winter storm lead to about 300 burst mains.

Right now, though, the city is focused on restoring the pressure and bringing its treatment plants up to full capacity.

“As PSI increases, we’ll start to see areas in the system having their water restored,” he said. “There is still no definitive timeline – it’s all based on the ability to increase PSI.

“That’s how we gauge our recovery – get the PSI in the system to increase.”

A second winter storm moving through Mississippi Thursday left thousands without power, and continued to affect travel and an array of services.

The cold weather is to continue into Friday. High temperatures will range from the lower 30s in northern Mississippi to the mid-40s in southern Mississippi, according to the National Weather Service in Jackson. However, some sunshine is expected to break through the clouds Friday.

""We're going with a hard freeze warning across most of the area again, generally along the northwest of the Natchez Trace tonight,"" Mike Edmonston, senior meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Jackson, said Thursday.

Edmonston added that all winter precipitation is expected to be over by Thursday evening for most of the state.

While there may be some thawing today there is a possibility of refreezing that can occur tonight and tomorrow morning, resulting in black ice on the roads. Temperatures will be dangerously cold. With the melting ice, be on the lookout for downed power lines and fallen trees. pic.twitter.com/2trokGH50q — msema (@MSEMA) February 18, 2021

Jackson area temperature forecast

Thursday: High, mid 30s, low, 22 overnight

Friday: High, mid-upper 30s, low, 18 overnight

Saturday: High, 40s, low, 30 overnight

Edmonston said the freezing temperatures Thursday and Friday night could lead to black ice, making it dangerous for drivers who might think the roadways are dry.

Sunday's temperatures in Mississippi will be in 50s

Edmonston said Sunday's high will be in the mid to upper 50s for most of the state, with the possible exception of Northwestern Mississippi.

Another cold front is expected to come through the state Sunday night, brining with it a chance for light rain. The northwest portion of the state could see a wintery mix, Edmonston said.

Power outages impact over 178,000

Early Thursday morning, the number of power outages was almost 200,000 throughout Mississippi. At 1:30 p.m., Poweroutage.us reported at least 137,090 power outages across Mississippi.

Entergy officials in a news release Thursday morning said nearly 90,000 customers were without power at 7:30 a.m. The company had more than 1,300 workers trying to restore power to homes and businesses, according to the release.

At 1:30 p.m., Entergy's outage map showed 71,974 customers without power. Southern Pine Electric showed 18,997 outages.

Officials continue to ask customers to conserve energy to prevent further power outages and included several tips on how to help limit energy usage.

Lower the thermostat to 68 degrees

Unplug electronic devices and turning off lights when not in use

Open blinds, drapes and curtains to let sunshine into the home

Delayg laundry, washing dishes and non-essential uses of electricity

Wash clothes in cold water

Taking a quick shower instead of a bath

Cook foods at the lowest possible setting

Don't allow warm air to escape the home

Mississippi Homeland Security tweeted Wednesday power outages can make some foods unsafe to eat.

The Center for Disease Control suggests to throw away any perishable food items that have not been refrigerated properly due to power outages, as well as any food with an unusual smell, color or texture.

Water boil notices

The city of Canton and Big Black Water System issued a water boil notice on Thursday, with officials posting on Facebook the notice could last four to five days.

City of Jackson officials posted on Facebook Thursday a precautionary water boil notice is still in effect, especially for areas with low to no water pressure. The city is expected to set up locations for those who need water. Jackson Fire Stations, except stations 10, 20 and 22, are offering water for flushing toilets.

There will be water bottle distribution sites at Smith Wills Stadium, the Metrocenter, the police academy, police precinct 1, Willowood Community Center, Virgie Middleton Community Center and city of Byram Fire Station.

City of Jackson will setup locations for citizens on their water system needing water.

Forty-plus degrees feels good, but the thaw hasn't ended the problems faced by cities across the South still reeling from a frozen week.

Water mains are still breaking regularly as temperatures rise, causing the water pressure to disappear. Maintenance crews are bracing for ice-melt flooding.

Airlines canceled flights. Hospitals struggled to stay sanitary. Schools without safe water told teachers not to come. Water treatment plants couldn't receive chemicals because the roads were too icy for the trucks to get through.

Sub-freezing temperatures beginning Feb. 15 wreaked havoc on water supplies, leaving some southerners without water for the entire week. And many of those people are still waiting. It is no longer freezing, but the problems have not gone away.

Boil advisories, in which residents were asked to heat tap water (if they had any) to kill bacteria, were in effect from in select areas from Arkansas to the eastern tip of Tennessee to the gulf shores of Louisiana. Tap water has become unreliable and the inability to flush toilets in some areas has caused people to line up for donations of water.

In Jackson, Mississippi, last week, cars waited to fill up 15-gallon buckets in a city give-away.

""I owe you honesty. I owe you truth,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. ""We do not have a definitive timeline on water restoration.""

In Jackson, 13 water breaks have been reported across the city so far and more are expected as the thaw continues. In 2018, the city suffered through more than 200 water main breaks in similar freezing conditions.

Residents in three of Louisiana's largest 10 cities — Alexandria, Lake Charles and Shreveport — have been without running water or under boil orders for a week with nearly a quarter of the state's 4.6 million population without clean water from the tap.

State Rep. Thomas Pressley, R-Shreveport, said on Twitter he and other officials visited the low-income housing complex Canaan Tower Apartments, where residents have been without water.

SHREVEPORT MAYOR: Louisiana treated like stepchild of nation during winter weather disaster

""What is happening there should never happen in a first world country,"" Pressley tweeted, saying he and others are working to deliver resources to the residents. ""Disturbing is an understatement.""

Those boil advisories will be in effect until at least Friday.

In Hinds County, Mississippi, officials are monitoring the rise of water levels on the Pearl and Big Black rivers as the ice begins to melt.

Emergency Management Director Joey Perkins said the Pearl River is currently below the 28-foot flood threshold, the level where the river is at risk for flooding. He advised residents to be prepared and keep an eye out for messages from the department on its website and social media.

Pump station problems in Tennessee forced water to be shut off for more than 260,000 homes.

Water wasn't the only concern. Electricity has been out in some regions leaving millions of residents from Minnesota to Texas without heat.

As the horrific conditions in Texas have drawn national attention, the problems in the South have left some officials pleading for help.

In all, the Louisiana Department of Health on Sunday reported 44 water systems with outages impacting more than 80,000 customers and 303 systems with boil advisories affecting more than 1 million customers.

""Louisiana has been treated like the stepchild of the nation during this disaster, and Shreveport has been treated like the stepchild of Louisiana,"" Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins said. ""It's frustrating.""

In Memphis, Shelby County Schools teachers were delayed from returning to classrooms for at least Monday and Tuesday this week. The water wasn't safe enough to have teachers on campus.

Restaurants in the Memphis area were asked to boil water, and if they chose not to follow that order, they were asked to police themselves and close.

Memphis Light Gas and Water customers will need to continue to boil their drinking water and conserve water for the foreseeable future.

""We are still in that state and will be until further notice,"" said MLGW President and CEO J.T. Young.

Utility officials had originally asked Memphians to conserve water until noon on Monday. On Sunday, they said they were extending that request indefinitely.

The search is on in Memphis for broken water mains, which are usually four to six feet underground.

So far, Memphis has not had a problem with its fire department getting water. MLGW has agreed to temporarily increase water pressure in the are of a fire so the Memphis Fire Department could do its work.

There is a bit of optimism in Memphis.

Young said the MLGW was turning the corner in the battle to gain control of the many factors contributing to low pressure within the water system.

""We are continually moving in the right direction. We see our pumping stations getting better every day, we're still a little in the red, but we're getting better,"" Young said.

182,27-Apr-21,CBS News,"Race, politics, and the crumbling water infrastructure in Mississippi's capital city","Last February, as back-to-back winter storms buried the deep south in snow and ice, some residents in Jackson, Mississippi, found themselves facing an additional hardship. They had no water running water for weeks.

Ronnie Crudup, a bishop at New Horizon Church in the city, said he was without water for 18 days.

""This [winter storm] was one of the worst in the central part of Mississippi, we don't get a lot of cold weather, and so that made us very, very susceptible,"" Crudup told 60 Minutes+ correspondent Wesley Lowery. ""I had never experienced a point where I saw no water come out of the pipes.""

But even without the winter weather, Crudup said, the city's water infrastructure constantly fails its residents.

""If you drive through the city, you're going to see all this water coming up… because the infrastructure is old and decrepit,"" Crudup said. ""It has not been maintained well.""

60 Minutes+'s Lowery reports this week on the confluence of race and politics underlying Jackson's deteriorating water system, which is badly in need of an overhaul.

""White flight"" in the 70s and 80s created a vicious cycle that saw businesses close in Jackson, prompting cuts in city services due to a lack of tax revenue. Over that time, Jackson went from being 60% White to nearly 60% Black. Now, more than 80% of the city's 160,000 inhabitants are Black.

State officials have developed a reportedly rocky relationship with the city, leading to a lack of investment from the state legislature. Bishop Ronnie Crudup thinks that the city's new racial makeup is likely a factor in its strained relationship with the state.

""You would want your capital city hopefully to be a shining star. You know, sometimes the State and the city legislation and all those folks, they're anti-Jackson, okay?"" Crudup said. ""Once Jackson became predominantly Black, it had Black leadership-- then it seemed to be a level of tension between the state government and Jackson that may not have been there, okay? That may not be true, but that's sure how I and a number of other folks perceive it….""

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, who at 34 was elected the youngest leader in city history, seemed to agree.

""I think that we would be less than honest with ourselves if we did not… just directly confront the issues of race that we have in Mississippi and in the United States,"" Lumumba said.

Meanwhile, city residents are forced to deal with water outages and advisories to boil their water before cooking, washing their hands or brushing their teeth. The city's public works department can't keep up with the leaks across the city's hundreds of miles of pipes that are, in some cases, brittle to the touch.

Houston has lifted its boil water advisory as much of Texas' utility services recover from back-to-back winter storms.

The boil water advisory in Houston had been in place since Wednesday but has been lifted after water quality testing submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality confirmed that tap water meets all regulatory standards and is safe to drink, according to a press release from the city.

""The historic freezing temperatures in Houston last week caused water pressure to drop throughout the city,"" Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement. ""I appreciate everyone's patience as Houston Water crews worked nonstop to restore the pressure and gain the TCEQ's approval to lift the boil water notice.""

Nearly 3 million bottles of water have been distributed in Houston since Wednesday, Turner said.

The freezing temperatures and snow from the storm knocked out power grids, ruptured water mains and rendered water treatment plants unworkable.

On Friday, more than 14.4 million people in Texas, about half of the state's population, were affected by weather-related disruptions to water service. More than 1,100 public water supply systems reported disruptions in service on Friday morning, according to a spokesperson for the TCEQ.

More than 5 million people have come off boil water advisories in the last 48 hours, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in a press conference Sunday afternoon. It is unclear how many Texas residents are still under a boil-water advisory. Busted pipes remain an issue, and the state is bringing in more plumbers to speed up the recovery, Abbott said.

""We want to make sure that the state is stepping up to do everything that we can to help people in their homes who are trying to repair busted pipes,"" he said.

About 30,000 Texas residents are still without power, but all power should be restored by Monday, Abbott said.

Of the 76 people who died as a result of the inclement weather last week, half of them resided in Texas, The Associated Press reported.

President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in Texas to allow federal aid to flow into the state.

ABC News' Matt Fuhrman contributed to this report.","Houston has lifted its boil water advisory as much of Texas' utility services recover from back-to-back winter storms.
The boil water advisory in Houston had been in place since Wednesday but has been lifted after water quality testing submitted to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality confirmed that tap water meets all regulatory standards and is safe to drink, according to a press release from the city.

184,4-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,"As Jackson residents suffer during historic water crisis, state leaders keep their distance","Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann is one of the most powerful residents of Jackson, where about 40,000 of his neighbors — mostly Black — are in their third week without running water after a historic winter storm froze plant equipment and burst many water pipes.

The ongoing water crisis is the result of decades of inaction from city leaders, who put off routine maintenance and meaningful infrastructure repairs as the city’s tax base and revenue collections diminished. Current and former city leaders, having dealt for decades with aging and brittle pipes, say they need investment from the state and federal government.

Many are placing their hope for financial support from the state with Hosemann, who lives in northeast Jackson and wields significant control of the state’s purse strings. He was asked this week about whether the state should step in and help.

“If you remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer,” Hosemann responded, referring to the last white Jackson mayor who left office in 1997. “So what’s happened since then? The prime mover (of solving the problem) needs to be the city itself. Those people have to come up with a reasonable plan to get their water bills out on time.”

Hosemann continued: “Where do you start? What are the most complicated places? What’s your plan to do that? How much money is it going to take, and how do you even pay for it? I haven’t seen any of that. Clearly, it’s not the state. The city is the city of Jackson. It elects its mayor, it elects its city councilmen. And those people need to come up with a plan.”

With his answer, Hosemann joined a decades-long chorus of statewide elected officials who misrepresent the causes of Jackson’s infrastructure problems and are reluctant to offer long-term solutions. Mississippi Today spoke with several of the state’s top leaders this week about the current water crisis, and all of them echoed similar sentiments.

Jackson, the state’s largest city, is at least 80% Black. Statewide elected officials are white; the state of Mississippi has never elected a Black statewide official, and legislative leaders who control the state’s budget are white. Most of the city’s white residents like Hosemann, because of more recent infrastructure upgrades in northeast Jackson and their proximity to water treatment plants, rarely experience long-term outages.

Meanwhile, residents in south and west Jackson, majority-Black areas of the city, take the brunt of the city’s infrastructure failings. And because of careful legislative gerrymandering and segregated politics, Black elected officials at the Capitol have little influence over the budget process or other major policy negotiations.

Now 17 days since Jackson’s current water crisis began, an estimated 11,000 households, or around 40,000 people, are still without running water. City officials cannot say definitively when water service will be restored. At least 80 water main breaks and leaks have been reported across the city, and the entire city remains under a boil water notice. Crews completing the repairs have described city pipes, some over 100 years old, as brittle, underscoring the need for a vast overhaul of the city’s aging infrastructure.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has estimated a complete water and sewer replacement project would cost around $2 billion, more than six times the city’s annual budget. On Wednesday, Lumumba wrote a letter to state and federal leaders asking for an emergency appropriation of $47 million to make necessary repairs to solve this current crisis.

“The city of Jackson, like most cities, is under-resourced and not capable of making these corrections based on our own budgetary ability,” Lumumba said during a Wednesday night interview on MSNBC.

Even after water service is restored to the whole city, future crises of this magnitude are all but certain without that overhaul. The years of dedicated investment and work this would take are more than any city could handle on its own, especially one with a gutted tax base — due in large part to outmigration of white residents and business owners who began leaving the city in the 1980s.

Ditto, the city’s last white mayor that Hosemann referenced this week, struggled mightily to maintain the aged infrastructure his white predecessors failed to maintain. One of the worst water crises during Ditto’s tenure as mayor was in 1989, when thousands of the city’s residents were without water on Christmas Day after record low temperatures burst pipes. Hosemann’s comments about Ditto’s tenure have been sharply critiqued in many circles this week.

“I was disappointed that we have leaders in our community who are spreading this kind of misinformation,” Harvey Johnson, Jackson’s first Black mayor who succeeded Ditto in 1997, said of Hosemann’s comments. “It’s a criticism that was misplaced and unfounded. It just perpetuates, in my opinion, this whole notion that Jackson, as a Black city that has Black leadership, can’t do anything themselves. That’s the furthest thing from the truth, and I take offense to that. I’ve been in the venues of public service for 40 years, and have prepared myself to deal with the problems of local government and how to address those problems.

Johnson continued: “For someone (Hosemann) who has a limited perspective on that, I just take exception when they start spouting out those things.”

And while many scoff at providing state assistance, leaders in the city acknowledge they can’t rebuild their infrastructure without that help. As the state’s largest and capital city, anchoring the only true metropolitan area of the state, Jackson’s problems are the state’s problems, they argue.

“State leaders need to understand the importance of the city of Jackson when it comes to the growth of our state in economic development, education, healthcare and other business opportunities,” said state Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson. “Jackson is the tree trunk, and the rest of the state are the branches. If the trunk dies, the branches die. So we need to make a concerted effort to make sure the roots are healthy and strong.”

With no long-term solution in sight, Jackson residents continue to suffer and national news crews descend upon the city to cover the crisis. Meanwhile, state leaders continue to put the impetus on the city to fix its own problems. Top leaders interviewed by Mississippi Today this week said they haven’t heard from city leaders directly about the notion of helping, and some expressed concern about stepping in without an ask.

“Do you interfere when you are not asked to? That could be not taken well by some if you do,” Rep. Trey Lamar, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Mississippi Today.

In terms of state funding, Lamar said there could be opportunities to help the city, “but that depends on what the definition of help is.”

“I don’t think there’s any appetite to help Jackson in the form of a handout,” Lamar said. “Number one, we need to be shown proof that the city is incapable of fixing this problem on their own. I don’t know that legislative support would be there for a handout, but there might be other ways the state could help ensure the work is done if the city were financially responsible for it with the state’s help.”

Gov. Tate Reeves, while answering questions about Jackson’s water crisis on Feb. 23, bluntly reminded listeners that the state doesn’t run Jackson’s water system but vaguely added, “Perhaps we should.” The governor hasn’t acknowledged that comment or the possibility of a state takeover since, and his office has not answered several follow-up questions about it from Mississippi Today.

But during a press conference on Tuesday, Reeves said that “most things should be on the table” when asked if he supported a proposal that would allow the city of Jackson to increase its sales tax by 1% to pay for infrastructure repairs. Then he quickly pivoted to the city’s water billing woes.

“I do think it’s really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money,” Reeves said. “I think that’s been a long standing challenge for the city. I think they will admit that. Clearly their billing system is flawed at best.”

The governor is correct about the city’s water billing challenges. In 2012, the city signed a $91 million contract with Siemens, an international company renowned for its work on municipal water and sewer systems. The contract, the largest in city history, included the installation of new water meters and a modern billing system.

But that contract turned out to be one of the biggest failures in the company’s and city’s history. Siemens failed to deliver on its promises, which led to widespread billing issues and thousands of faulty water meters. Many Jackson residents received inaccurate bills, while others stopped getting billed at all. This left the city with a deficit of around $2 million each month in water collections revenue, and the billing problems continue today.

The city filed a lawsuit against Siemens in June 2019, eventually seeking $450 million in damages. The two parties reached a $89.8 million settlement in March 2020, but that didn’t erase the systemic problems Siemens left behind or recoup the hundreds of millions in water revenue the city lost.

Doing what little they can with limited resources, Jackson’s city council on Tuesday approved a proposal for the 1% sales tax increase to help pay for water and sewage system improvements. That local tax increase requires approval from the Mississippi Legislature, which is controlled by Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn, a resident of Clinton.

If the proposal receives legislative approval, it will be placed on a ballot referendum for Jackson residents. However, even if the water tax gets the go-ahead, it would take nearly 143 years for it to generate enough revenue to fund the much-needed water and sewer improvements.

Though lawmakers have long been apprehensive to work with the city, they have passed several measures in recent years to help solve some of the city’s problems. Lawmakers signed off on a one-cent sales tax increase in 2014, giving Jackson new revenue that no other Mississippi city has for infrastructure repairs. The tax has generated around $14 million each year in additional tax revenue. But city leaders, who have opted to spend that additional revenue on less expensive road repairs and repaving instead of replacing pipes beneath the streets, have been criticized for their handling of those funds.

Lawmakers also created the Capitol Complex Improvement District in 2017, which diverted sales tax revenue to fund new infrastructure fixes in Jackson. The aim of the legislation was for the state to pay its fair share for repairs in areas of the city where the state has offices and conducts business.

“I think everybody is frustrated with the city’s plight,” said state Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson who worked with state leaders on the 1% sales tax and the Capitol Complex District legislation. “The people who live here are. The people who visit are. Legislators are frustrated. They don’t have confidence in much of the city’s elected leadership. That makes them reluctant to help the city.”

Horhn, who has run unsuccessfully for Jackson mayor several times, said the state’s elected leaders have a long-standing “love-hate relationship” with the city, inspired by decades of neglecting the infrastructure system.

“Part of it is urban-rural. There is a racial overtone,” Horhn said. “There is a sense that the quality of leadership in the capital city is the reason for the problems. A lot of people (at the Capitol) have lost confidence in the elected leadership in Jackson.”

During his interview on Monday, Hosemann launched into an aside, unprompted, about crime in the city of Jackson. While the city saw a historic high in homicides in 2020, white politicians have a long history of exploiting the city’s crime struggles when brushing off calls to help the city.

Hosemann argued that the Legislature is already shouldering undue burdens from the city of Jackson and Hinds County, citing a pending Senate bill that would give Capitol Police jurisdiction over the parts of Jackson and federal CARES Act funds spent on the Hinds County court system. Four special judges were appointed in July to help try the backlog of Hinds County cases that built up during the early months of the pandemic.

“They have cases going back to 1997,” Hosemann said of the Hinds County courts, which hear cases from outside the city of Jackson. “People are not getting tried, and people are dying. There’s murder in the streets here.”

Eventually circling back to the water crisis, Hosemann downplayed any notion of the state stepping in.

“The Legislature is doing its part, we’re doing stuff every day to help our capital city,” Hosemann said. “I live here, my children live here, my grandchildren live here. Some of this, they need to get their water bills out. I will tell you that there are a myriad of problems. To answer your question, no one has contacted us about taking over Jackson’s water.”

The city of Jackson officially lifted its boil water advisory Monday morning after a fire at one of the city's water treatment plants shut it down just months after an outage left residents without water for weeks.

The city had been under a notice since Friday when an electrical fire at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility knocked out power to the plant. The fire shut off power to two of the plant's pumps.

Residents across the city were without water for several hours before work crews were able to restore power and replenish the tanks.

City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said in an email on Sunday that the city has delivered two consecutive days of water samples to the health department.

The notice applies to about 43,000 customers on the city's surface water system.

190,30-Apr-21,WJTV,City of Byram impacted by water outage,"BYRAM, Miss. (WJTV) – Some businesses were affected by the city-wide water outage, including the Holiday Inn Express near I-55 South in Byram. It came as a result of the fire that took place Friday at the O.B. Water Treatment Plant in Ridgeland.

“Most of my city is not going to be affected but what is affected, I know I got a call from holiday inn they’re pretty upset because they don’t have no water on the second floor at all,” said Byram mayor Richard White.

The mayor broke down the area of Byram using the well-water and surface water. He said everything west of the interstate except the apartments in Byram is the surface water area that comes from the reservoir.

“Everybody on surface water would be the apartments, Holiday Inn and everything on the interstate 55 and everything down to Jackson industrial is going to be boil water starting right now,” he said.

Currently, Byram gets its surface water from Jackson. Mayor White is pushing for the city to get control of its own water.

“This is just another opportunity for us to have our own water and that’s what I will be pursuing, I think that is something that’s needs to be done,” he said.","(WJTV) – Some businesses were affected by the city-wide water outage, including the Holiday Inn Express near I-55 South in Byram.

191,22-Feb-21,Insurance Journal,Deep Freeze Causes Problems Across the South; Broken Water Mains Plague Cities,"Workers in Tennessee raced Sunday to fix water mains that failed in freezing temperatures, and COVID-19 vaccine shipments resumed as the South carried on with efforts to recover from the winter weather that paralyzed parts of the nation.

In Texas, where millions of people endured days of bitter cold without power, officials urged President Joe Biden to visit as soon as possible.

Ten inches of snow fell in Memphis last week, followed by a sustained cold snap. With the forecast calling for temperatures to climb into the 50s, the city expected to see significant melting of the snow and ice that accumulated on streets, sidewalks and roofs. The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power.

At least 76 deaths have been attributed to the weather across the country. The Tennessee Department of Health on Saturday confirmed two weather-related fatalities in Sumner County, bringing the state’s current weather fatalities to 10.

Now the problem is not enough water.

Memphis remained under a boil advisory Sunday after officials said they were concerned that low water pressure caused by problems at aging pumping stations and a rash of water main ruptures could lead to contamination. Memphis, Light, Gas & Water has not said when it expects to lift the advisory, which has been in place since Thursday.

The utility’s president and CEO, J.T. Young, compared the situation to a hospital patient in critical condition.

“We are in the red status, if you will,” Young said Saturday.

About 260,000 homes and businesses were under the advisory. Hospitals and nursing homes switched to bottled water. The Tennessee National Guard was supplying St. Francis Hospital with water.

Nearby Baptist Memorial Hospital took on some of St. Francis’ patients, particularly those who need dialysis, said Dr. Jeff Wright, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Baptist. That hospital has a water purification system for dialysis and has water reserves for tasks such as cooking and bathing patients, he said.

City officials distributed water bottles at several locations Sunday. Grocery stores struggled to keep shelves stocked with bottled water. Many restaurants remained closed.

Flights resumed Saturday at Memphis International Airport after everything was grounded Friday because of water pressure problems. Some problems still lingered, but airport officials set up temporary restrooms.

Meanwhile in Kentucky and West Virginia, workers grappled with repairs to broken utility poles and downed lines.

About 37,000 customers in West Virginia were still without electricity Sunday, down from a peak of 97,000, according to Appalachian Power. The utility planned to use helicopters and drones Sunday to identify problems in remote areas. Some homes have been without power since back-to-back ice storms on Feb. 11 and Feb. 15.

The company has identified roughly 1,500 separate locations that need repairs and warned that while repairs are being made, the work remains difficult. In Wayne County, workers had to replace the same pole three times because trees kept falling on it.

About 30,000 customers remained without power Sunday in Kentucky, including more than 14,000 Kentucky Power customers in the state’s eastern reaches, according to poweroutage.us, a website that tracks outages.

Utility officials said some of their customers are still recovering from the recent paralyzing winter weather, particularly in Boyd, Carter and Lawrence counties. More than 2,000 Kentucky Power employees, foresters and assessors were working to get power restored.

Meanwhile, in middle Tennessee, power outages remained for approximately 3,300 residents as of Sunday.

Water issues plagued parts of Mississippi as well. In Jackson, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water on Friday. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Meanwhile, the White House said about a third of the COVID-19 vaccine doses delayed by the storm were delivered over the weekend. The weather created a backlog of about 6 million doses as power outages closed some vaccination centers and icy weather stranded vaccine in shipping hubs.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told ABC’s “This Week” that about 2 million of the 6 million doses have gone out.

“We expect to rapidly catch up this week,” she said.

In Nashville, Tennessee, local COVID-19 task force leader Dr. Alex Jahangir said more than 2,300 seniors and teachers got vaccinated Saturday as the city resumed offering shots after days of treacherous weather.

Due to the wintry mess, local health officials last week vaccinated more than 500 people with doses that otherwise would have expired, including hundreds at homeless shelters and residents of a historically Black neighborhood who were mostly seniors with underlying health conditions.

President Joe Biden is eager to visit Texas, which was hit especially hard by the weather, Psaki said. Biden hopes to travel to the state this week but “doesn’t want to take away resources” from the response, she said.

“He is eager to go down to Texas and show his support,” she said. “But he is also very mindful of the fact that it’s not a light footprint for a president to travel to a disaster area.”

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that Biden can come anytime.

“We certainly would welcome him,” Turner said.

Texas Rep. Michael McCaul told CNN’s “State of the Union” that federal disaster relief can be used to help Texans hit with skyrocketing energy bills, repair burst pipes and repair flood damage.

192,18-Feb-21,WLBT,"Residential leaks, power outages drain Crystal Springs’ water system","CRYSTAL SPRINGS, Miss. (WLBT) - People in Crystal Springs are being asked to report any water leaks to the police department so their water can be temporarily shut off.

The Copiah County town is waking up without water Thursday morning, after power to the city’s water wells went out.

“Actually, they went to bed last night without water,” said Mayor Sally Garland. “They’re going to get up this morning too.

At about 5 p.m. Wednesday, a power outage occurred at the city’s water wells, causing production there to come to a halt. Meanwhile, water consumption continued until the town’s reserve tanks ran dry.

“We have three wells on Southern Pine that are down. We did put a generator on one of the wells last night to fill the tanks up, but it did not work,” she said. “We’re still on zero this morning.”

The generator has started working, but the city has been unable to refill its tanks.

Garland said the main reason is leaky residential pipes.

“The moment we get water in there, if someone has something leaking under their house, it’s going to keep sucking the water out,” she said.

The city’s water system serves about 2,500 connections.

Garland is urging citizens to report leaks so water to those homes can temporarily be turned off.

“If anyone sees a leak coming out from under a house, be sure to let us know.”

She said water would be restored once the tanks are filled and electricity at the wells will be restored by noon Thursday.

In the meantime, she said individuals who are without power and water can go to the Copiah County Safe Room in Gallman.

“If you do go to the safe room, you have to bring your own supplies. You need to grab (something to eat and drink) and bring it with you,” she said. “It’s warm and it has running water.”

193,20-Feb-21,New York Post,Biden declares major disaster in Texas after massive winter storm,"President Biden signed a major disaster declaration Saturday for the most populated parts of winter storm ravaged Texas — assistance the state’s governor described as a “partial approval” of his appeal for federal help.

The president’s declaration approved individual assistance in 77 counties, and public assistance for emergency protective measures in all 254 counties of the Lone Star State.

Public assistance goes to repair or replace diaster damaged infrastructure or buildings, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Individual assistance is offered directly to residents who “sustained losses,” according to the agency.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott pushed Thursday for individual and public assistance for all 254 counties in the state, and said he’ll keep asking for more help.

“While this partial approval is an important first step, Texas will continue to work with our federal partners to ensure all eligible Texans have access to the relief they need,” Abbott said in statement.

FEMA has so far shipped dozens of generators and supplies to the stricken areas.

Volunteers also poured into the region, including Bronx Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who helped pack boxes at a Houston food pantry Saturday during a trip to deliver more than $2 million she raised to help in the crisis.

Biden said he hopes to visit Texas next week, as long as his entourage doesn’t interfere with recovery efforts.

A state power outage map showed about 60,000 customers remained in the dark for the fifth day on Saturday. Officials said the remaining outages were due to downed power lines.

The latest problem to emerge is plumbing. With the freeze lasting days, bursting pipes caused countless floods in homes and businesses across the region, leaving behind billions of dollars in damage.

Texas is scrambling to find plumbers to help.

Abbott said the state is working with out-of-state companies to dispatch experts to help fix all the broken pipes. More than 320 plumbers renewed lapsed licenses so they can help with the repairs as well.

And it’s not just an issue with the plumbing inside buildings.

Millions across Texas remained without running water Saturday while half the state was under boil or conserve water orders because public drinking water systems suffered weather-related problems. The state capital, Austin, reported tens of thousands of leaks had formed in its water system during the freeze.

Water problems extended to several other states as well.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in the Tennessee county that includes Memphis were told to boil water as were the residents of Jackson, Mississippi. Residents of Little Rock, Arkansas, were asked to conserve water.

Water issues also hampered hospital operations across the South.

A man died at an Abilene, Texas, health care facility where the lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible. His was one of at least 69 deaths across the U.S. blamed on the blast of winter weather.","President Biden signed a major disaster declaration Saturday for the most populated parts of winter storm ravaged Texas — assistance the state’s governor described as a “partial approval” of his appeal for federal help.

196,1 month ago,WLBT,Water pump repair in Jackson hits a snag,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson is working to restore water pressure to thousands of customers.

This week two pumps on their well system failed, causing pressure to drop from south Jackson into parts of Byram.

Friday afternoon, City Engineer Dr. Charles Williams said they had a problem with the temporary pump they were installing on Siwell Road.

They are now removing it and will work into the night to install it. That could mean more pressure problems until that work is done.

The contractor plans to work overnight Friday and anticipates having the well back online Saturday, May 22. This assuming there will be no additional delays or issues with installation.

The City of Jackson is installing two temporary pumps on their well system. The pumps will have to be replaced eventually but ordering parts will take some time.

The temporary pumps already providing relief to those who lost water pressure, as they saw it return Friday in areas of south Byram. This is one of several water outages Byram Mayor White says his residents have endured this year.

He’s in serious talks now to get Byram on their own water system.

Mayor Richard White said, “Well, they certainly wouldn’t have to be without water. But maybe we don’t need our pumps in Jackson. Maybe we can have pumps in our city or near our city and that’s what I’m thinking. We’ve got some people very capable of helping us.”

Dozens of cars lined up at the Forest Hill Fire Station Friday for a bottled water giveaway. Residents frustrated over yet another problem with the water pressure.

A man named Bradley said, “I have low pressure. I can’t flush my toilet. I got my grandkids who live with me. It’s very inconvenient. I wish the mayor would get up and do something.”

So many people turned up at the water giveaway they ran out of cases before the time the giveaway was even supposed to start. There is still a precautionary boil water notice for those who lost pressure.

They’re also asking residents to conserve water.

In Byram they’re hoping to have enough pressure to allow car washes to open this weekend.

A Jackson official said that water service could be restored by Friday to some residents on the well system in south Jackson and the city of Byram after two wells in the area failed earlier this week.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said a bad pump has been identified as the cause of one of the two failures, which has impacted service to roughly 2,000 customers.

Wells on Siwell and TV roads shut down Monday, which caused low water pressure and loss of service for some residents in the area. A precautionary boil water advisory was issued Tuesday, which affected roughly 1,000 customers, said Charles Williams, director for the Jackson Public Works Department. The notice was expanded later that day.

Williams said other issues with water service in areas of northwest Jackson are unrelated and could be due to issues with water meters in the area.

Contractors found the bad pump after dismantling the well on Siwell Road, Williams said, and a new one is being located. A temporary pump will be installed Thursday evening, which should increase pressure in the system, he said.

""Right now, our target objective to find a new pump for this particular site here at Siwell (Road),"" Williams said.

Engineers are still working to determine the issue at the TV Road well station, Williams said, but will install a temporary pump there as well, if necessary.

Residents in the area are encouraged to continue to conserve water in the area until the issue is fully resolved, which could take several days, Williams said.

""We're about to hit 90-degree weather, and often that puts a little bit more strain on our well system,"" he said.

Williams said he understands that residents are frustrated with water service in the city, especially after the city-wide water outage in February, but asked residents to be patient while repairs are being made.

""Unfortunately, we did not know this was going to happen. We had some work done on both of our wells last year and we didn't expect this to come at this particular point,"" he said. ""But we're working through it.""

198,25-Feb-21,Jackson Free Press,City of Jackson Update for Wednesday Evening,"(JACKSON, MS) – The City of Jackson is issuing the following updates for Wednesday, February 24, 2021, related to the impacts of recent winter weather on the City and the efforts being made:

WATER PRESSURE

Today the City’s pressure is still fluctuating between 70 to 80 psi. We have made gains in the recovery and more residents are being restored with water. This is a fluid process as the system continues to gain pressure. Each day more residents should be seeing their water restored.

We are gauging progress by measuring the psi (pounds per square inch) in the water distribution system. The goal is to reach around 90 psi at OB Curtis WTP and around 80 psi at JH Fewell WTP. Today’s reading is up from 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

The City Water Maintenance Department is still battling water main breaks, and making progress on the repairs. Please see the list below of confirmed, unconfirmed, and completed water main breaks. The City encourages residents to report any water main breaks to 311. A complete list of water main breaks is at the end of this release.

199,5-Mar-21,News 1130,Official: End in sight for Jackson residents without water,"JACKSON, Miss. — Crews continued working Friday to restore water to thousands of customers in Mississippi’s capital city of Jackson, where some taps have been completely dry for nearly three weeks.

“A lot of our residents have just had to endure this water outage, and it’s disheartening that it’s gone on this long,” Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday during a news conference. “But I see the light at the end of the tunnel.”

Williams said he hopes to see service restored to most customers in Jackson by the end of the weekend.

The water shortage in Jackson occurred after a winter storm passed through the region three weeks ago, freezing machinery at the water treatment plant. When it began to thaw, dozens of water mains broke.

The outage left people in the majority-Black city, where close to 30% of 160,000 residents live in poverty, scrambling to find water to flush toilets, bathe and drink. The National Guard was called in to assist at water distribution sites, where people waited for hours in lines of vehicles to fill buckets and bowls to fill with water.

A key focus to recovery has been filling the system’s water tanks. Williams said earlier in the week that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into the treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

Williams said Thursday he is feeling encouraged. It was “a good day” for the city’s water system, he said.

“Water is flowing through the system, and we are getting our tanks filled,” he said.

Williams said as the city’s tanks continue to fill, the city can start sampling the water to see about lifting the boil water notice, which has been in effect since Feb. 16.

By the end of the weekend, most customers will have service returned, with the exception of a few “isolated areas” — mostly areas impacted by water main breaks, he said. City workers patched around 70 water main breaks during the last three weeks, according to a news release.

“We are very sorry for this traumatic experience for our residents throughout this particular time and understand that this has been very difficult on everyone,” Williams said.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said that the water crisis has been caused in part because of decades of neglect regarding the city’s aging infrastructure. Parts of Jackson’s water system are a century old, he said.

A major factor impacting the city’s ability to update its system has been a rapidly declining tax base due to white flight. Jackson’s tax base began crumbling decades ago, starting after the integration of public schools. The city was 60% white in 1970, according to U.S. census data. In 2021, it is more than 80% Black.

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

On Wednesday, Lumumba penned a letter to Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves asking for $47 million in state and federal funding to begin repairing the water system.

“These improvements are critical to our efforts to ensure that our residents and businesses are not deprived of clean water again,” he wrote.

The two winter storms that came through the state in February made roads impassable for days and sent water systems offline due to the freezing temperatures. In Jackson, systems at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant were affected for days and warmer temperatures after the freeze caused more than 100 water main breaks and other leaks.

The outage affected all 43,000 water connections on the system, which includes residents in Byram, forcing residents to find bottled and nonpotable water to drink, bathe and flush toilets for weeks.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Residents of Mississippi’s capital city waited in line for hours Friday for drinking water while crews in the state and neighboring Louisiana scrambled to repair burst pipes after a vicious cold spell disrupted water service for hundreds of thousands of people in the two states.

Almost the entire city of Jackson with a population around 161,000 had very low water pressure or no water at all, though an official said the city was hoping to restore service by Sunday.

At a city-run water pick-up station near Jackson’s medical district, scores of cars idled in the slush for potable water. Paul Lee Davis said he’d been in line for three and a half hours. The site had run out of bottled water, and Davis was waiting for another shipment to arrive.

“A lot of people been giving up – they’re tired of waiting,” Davis said. “I’ve been here so long, I figure I might as well wait it out. We need water. The stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have.”

At one point, Thomas Johnson, 39, got out of his car to play saxophone for people waiting. He walked up and down the line of cars, stopping to play for a few seconds in front of each one.

“I’m just trying to spread a lot of cheer,” Johnson, whose family had been out of water for a few days, said. “It’s tough out here. It’s cold. People are trying to survive.”

Not everyone could easily access a water distribution site. Lisa Thomas, 58, said her steep driveway is a sheet of ice, so it’s hard to get her car out. Her 67-year-old husband is on a defibrillator and heart monitor and is running out of his heart medication, but she hasn’t even been able to make it to the pharmacy.

“It would be nice to have some type of answers,” she said. “People are in dire need here. We need urgent help.”

At three Louisiana hospitals operated by Ochsner-LSU Health, staff used sanitary wipes to bathe patients. Patients and staff — including about 200 staffers living temporarily in the hospitals — used commodes usually reserved for bedsides to go to the bathroom and bottled water to brush their teeth and wash their hands.

The two hospitals in Shreveport and one in Monroe canceled clinics and elective and outpatient surgery and had water trucked in by fire departments, the state and the National Guard to keep their boilers running for heat. Equipment sterilization sometimes was delayed because it depends partly on city water supplies.

More than 192,000 Louisiana residents — about 4% of the state’s population — were without water Friday, according to data released by the state health department.

Tens of thousands of additional residents remained under advisories that they should boil their water before use, including nearly 70,000 people in the central Louisiana city of Alexandria, according to the health department.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state’s water outages were in north Louisiana and in the southwest city of Lake Charles, which was hit hard by Hurricane Laura in August. He said bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned for the most affected areas, particularly focused on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers.

In the Louisiana town of Hackberry, the hot water pipes at the home where Nicole Beard was staying after her trailer was flattened by Laura burst three days ago. Then Thursday, the main water pipe into the house cracked, cutting off the water supply completely and forcing her to turn to bottled water. She said the communities that are facing water problems have not yet recovered from the hurricane.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.

The water woes along with power and heat outages are fallout from ice and snow storms early in the week that hammered Texas and other Southern states.

About 150,000 people in Louisiana and Mississippi were still without power on Friday afternoon, according to poweroutage.us. Entergy Mississippi president and CEO Haley Fisackerly said power could be restored to a majority of customers by early next week.

Plummeting temperatures froze water infrastructure and forced people to leave faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing. Officials in Mississippi and Louisiana urged people to turn off their faucets, saying that was sapping water pressure.

Nic Hunter, the mayor of Lake Charles, blamed thousands of leaking pipes on private property in part for the water pressure problems in his city. Lumumba cited Jackson’s aging water system.

“Our infrastructure is not prepared to handle this,” he said Thursday.

Jackson public works director Charles Williams said Friday that the city is trying to restore water pressure by Saturday or Sunday, but was dealing with more than a dozen water main breaks and the possibility of more damage as temperatures rise.

“We do understand the sense of urgency,” Williams said.

208,1 month ago,Jackson Free Press,"8,000 in Hinds County Still Without Power Since Tuesday Tornado, Storms","Hinds County still had 8,000 power outages as of noon, with more than 1,800 in Madison County and 118 in Rankin County as a result of Tuesday’s tornado and storms. Entergy said the majority of customers should have power returned by tonight, while hardest-hit areas could remain powerless until Friday.

As of 6 p.m. Wednesday evening, Entergy estimated that 26,000 of its 80,000 affected customers throughout Mississippi were without power, but that number had dropped to 17,000 by noon today. Most of these affected customers are spread throughout Copiah, Hinds, Madison, Rankin and Warren Counties, which Entergy says are areas “hit hardest by the storm.” Tuesday’s storms caused over 80,000 power outages across the state and at least three deaths across the South, while hundreds of thousands were left without power.

The dangerous storms ripped through Jackson on Tuesday afternoon, with battering winds up to 80 miles per hour and driving rain. WLBT footage shows storms and tornadic activity along a busy Lakeland Drive intersection as heavy traffic, including a school bus, tries to maneuver just as the tornadic storm passed through that area of Jackson.

After a weekend with no clean water, the storm downed trees across the Jackson metro, with falling trunks and branches striking some homes across the city. Jacksonians posted pictures across social media of splintered trees and blocked-off roadways.

“Tornadoes, high winds, thunderstorms, and lightning resulted in damage to our systems, affecting transmission lines, substations and distribution lines and equipment,” reads a statement from Entergy on Tuesday. “After a storm, it could take up to three days of our scouts assessing damage before we will know how long it will take to restore everyone’s power.”

The tornadic storm is the second this week to affect parts of the state. Tornados and hail hit parts of Yazoo County on Sunday, causing major home damage and power outages before moving further northeast with damage in Tupelo and other area.

Tuesday’s storm struck as President Joe Biden issued a disaster declaration for Mississippi following February’s ice storm, which paves the way for federal relief funding to reach every county listed in the declaration.

209,1-Mar-21,WLBT,Residents still affected by water outages as crews continue work,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - People on Glendale Street, just like all over the city, are praying that the water is restored sooner than later.

“Well it’s been pretty bad, the pressure finally tried to pick up a little bit, and then it erupted down there,” said Charlie Bacon, who lives on Glendale Street.

Bacon, who is a plumber, said it has been frustrating with no water, but even when the water came back for a moment, it was murky. City Engineer Charles Williams said this is a challenge for the city’s resources.

“But I do want to stress that we are doing everything we can,” said Williams. “We didn’t expect this to happen, but we’re dealing with the aftermath of it. We’re also dealing with the science of how the water system was designed.”

Bacon laughs about how he wants to take matters into his own hands. He works for Mr. Fix It Plumbing, and their motto is, “If water, gas, or sewage goes through it, I do it!”

“I wanted to go over there and fix it, but I know that it’s in the streets and that the city has to fix it, so I just rode by,” Bacon said. “Hopefully the city can get it done.”

It’s not out of the question, though, that the city could bring in additional resources.

“If we do need to bring in additional contractors to help, I have a meeting today with my supervisors to discuss the ongoing strategies,” Williams said.

But it sounds like Charlie Bacon has had his plate full ever since the weather came in.

“House calls all day long, all week long, Monday though Sunday,” he said. “Then some people wanted theirs fixed because it was froze, but I said, ‘You have to wait ‘til it thaws out before we can find anything.’ So it’s helped business a lot.”

As severe winter weather moves into Mississippi, residents are advised to take precautions, stay home and stay safe as the state prepares for dangerously cold temperatures, ice and freezing rain.

5 p.m. Saturday

The National Weather Service in Jackson has issued a winter storm warning for most of Mississippi in effect from noon Sunday through 6 a.m. Tuesday.

Power outages and tree damage are likely because of ice. Areas could see cold wind chills as low as 5 below zero, according to the National Weather Service.

The metro Jackson area can expect temperatures in the lower 30s Sunday, meteorologist Eric Carpenter said. Low temperatures are expected to be in the upper teens and lower 20s Monday. Monday night could see cold temperatures in the single digits, Carpenter said.

Parts of northwest Mississippi along the Delta region near Vicksburg, Yazoo City and Eupora are under an extreme threat for dangerous cold temperatures. Hypothermia and frostbite are likely with prolonged exposure, according weather officials.

Carpenter added there is an elevated threat for ice accumulation Sunday for areas west of Natchez, Canton and Eupora.

11 a.m. Saturday

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba urged residents to stay safe and stay home Monday, if possible, ahead of the expected winter weather during a press conference Saturday.

""As you are aware, our infrastructure is not prepared for the winter weather that we often experience when the roads ice over,"" Lumumba said.

Lumumba added if anyone comes across barricades located in some areas of the city, they should avoid traveling on those roads as they might be unsafe.

JATRAN suspended service Saturday and will be closed Monday because of the forecasted weather. Lumumba said JATRAN could have a possible late start Tuesday. More details will be announced later.

A cold weather shelter has opened through next Friday at Champions Gym, 1355 Hattiesburg St., for those who need a place to stay. The Opportunity Center has also opened up for those in need of a place to stay. To reserve a bed at the Opportunity Center, call 601-949-3540.

""We want to get the word out that these facilities are open for their benefit, to protect their lives,"" Lumumba said during the press conference.

Public Works Director Charles Williams asked drivers to be cautious driving Tuesday morning, as road conditions could still be dangerous from the lingering weather.

Williams said the city isn't currently experiencing a significant volume of water main breaks, but the city is preparing for an expected high volume of water main breaks next week. Williams encouraged the public to report any water main breaks or low water pressure by calling 311.

""We have tried our best to prepare for this particular weather event, especiallyat our water treatment plants, but as you know, most of the preparations that we do sometimes, we can't prepare enough,"" Williams said.

City officials are anticipating that various city facilities will be closed Monday and possibly Tuesday, depending on the weather. If city buildings do open Tuesday, they are expected to open later than usual.

Update 10:40 a.m. Saturday

Highway 471 and I-20 west bound are back open in the City of Brandon after city crews treated the roadways with salt.

The Madison Parkway Bridge at the railroad tracks is closed until further notice because of ice accumulation, according to a Facebook post by the Madison Police Department. Department officials warn drivers to use extreme caution while all other roadways and bridges are open.

The Hinds County Department of Emergency Management tweeted black ice was reported on some bridges and roadways in Hinds County. Drivers are reminded to slow down as the ice has caused a few wrecks.

218,31-Mar-21,Jackson Free Press,Jackson Free Press,"David Martin, a 29-year-old engineer at Hunter Engineering Company's Raymond office, says that a boosted Jackson economy is on his wish list for Jackson's next mayor. The Jacksonian packed his red car at Raceway gas station on Highway 18 to fill up on gas on March 20 and spoke with the reporter there to interview Jackson residents on what they want from the winning mayoral candidate in the coming election.

Seven people are running against Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to wrest the city's leadership from his grasp after his first term ends in early July. Two Democrats are running against him: fireman Kenneth Wilson and west Jackson native Patty Patterson; two Republicans: Jason Wells and Ponto Downing; and three independent candidates: Shafeqah Lodree, Charlotte Reeves and Les Tannehill.

The April 6 primary election only includes candidates running as Democrats or Republicans. The three independent candidates will join the two parties' primary election winners as contestants in the June 8 municipal general election.

Martin said he believes that the city is full of potential awaiting exploration. Rather than see degradation, he sees possibilities and wants an emphasis on management, refusing to buy into the narrative that Jackson has a shortage of resources.

""I want more concern with how money is being spent in Jackson,"" Martin said. ""Jackson is not—I guess you could say—a poor city; we have a lot of resources that are mismanaged basically."" He did not provide any data to back this claim.

""You have a lot of (calls for) help that goes unanswered like they don't—I guess—try, they don't try all the things that they could be trying to make this city better than what it could be,"" Martin added. ""You got a lot of rundown areas of town that could be used, we can boost the economy, we've got the space, and we've got the people, so we've got the workforce, but there are no jobs for the workforce we have.""

Martin says more opportunities for young people will go a long way. ""But if there aren't nobody hiring, what else (are) they going to do?"" he asked. ""I just want to see (a) better direction for the city.""

Carrie Jones, also at the gas station, expressed concern about the city's water situation, still reeling from the February winter storm that resulted in water outages and a month-long citywide boil-water notice. She wants repairs to be a priority, including low water pressure. Even after the city lifted the boil-water notice one month after the water crisis started, ""people are still afraid to drink the water,"" Jones said. ""People (are) still kind of leery of it.""

City of Jackson Election Commission Chairwoman Linda Sanders said her team is preparing for the 138,000 people on the voter roll, but projected based on past numbers that far fewer will turn up to vote.

""We have ordered equipment, and we also ordered ballots for everybody, and we're prepared and ready for them,"" she told the Jackson Free Press on March 18. ""We don't even get 50,000 voters for the municipal, but of course we prepare for them, and we are ready for them.""

The capital city's population is currently about 160,000 people, down from a historic high of 200,000.

Chokwe A. Lumumba, Incumbent Democrat

In statements provided to the Jackson Free Press, Lumumba referenced his popularity in the 2017 municipal election that ushered in his first term, saying he won the large Democratic primary field convincingly without a runoff and claimed numerous achievements. On why he is seeking reelection, he touts his experience of the last four years.

""Jackson needs a mayor who has been tested, who has shown up for our city, who understands the process and, in spite of the challenges, knows how to collaborate and get things done,"" he said in the statement.

Lumumba's reelection website contains a video of him addressing the increased rate of homicide—128 in 2020—in the city under his watch and what he plans to do about it.

""Most important aspect of this job is the work that we do to protect the lives of our residents,"" he said. ""The violence we have experienced in our city has revealed the deep crisis in which too many of our families find themselves and the need to challenge ourselves to meet these new realities with much more.""

Lumumba mentioned more officers' recruitment and adjustment of entry-level salaries for JPD, provision of body cameras and improved street lighting as parts of his efforts. He said that the pandemic had aggravated societal problems. He also noted that state and federal governments should do more for mental health and other supports.

""Our vision of Jackson will be a city that seeks to solve problems of crime holistically as symptoms of much deeper issues,"" Lumumba said in the video presentation. ""A city with commitment and compassion for all of our residents, a holistic approach to addressing the root causes of crime is important because it works.""

Patty Patterson, Democrat

Patterson provided information to the Jackson Free Press revealing her work as an entrepreneur and on community-engagement initiatives. She said she is running for mayor to get Jackson back on the right track.

""With the understanding of municipal government, I can start on Day One with a plan of action to improve our essential qualities,"" she stated. ""Improving our water quality, crime-fighting abilities, infrastructure, and public education system will allow our city to build strong economic base.""

The first thing on her vision on her campaign website is ""Crime and Public Safety,"" a common concern.

""Jackson's Police and Fire Departments must be equipped with modern technology and adequate resources in order to serve and protect the citizens of Jackson,"" she stated. ""It is equally important that our first responders safely return homes to their families.""

""Programs will be initiated to create a stable workforce and reduce crime,"" she added. ""We can also get a stronger grip on crime when we remove guns from the hands of irresponsible citizens.""

She mentioned mental health as linked to crime and said she will take a stronger approach toward addressing it and also join forces with other law enforcement agencies.

Kenneth Wilson, Democrat

Kenneth Wilson, Ridgewood Park Neighborhood Association president and former City of Jackson firefighter, is campaigning on five issues, as noted on his campaign website: public safety, infrastructure, community improvement, education and economic improvement.

In a YouTube video, Wilson mentioned the impact of high homicide rates on families and said that businesses are leaving because of crime. ""Good businesses that have been burglarized multiple times, and absolutely nothing has been done about it,"" he said.

Wilson mentioned that his solution to the safety concern starts with appointing another police chief, replacing James Davis. However, Lumumba has stated that Davis has his confidence.

""The first thing we have to do, we have to appoint a (police) chief that the men and women will support. I think that's very essential if we intend to improve the city of Jackson,"" Wilson said. His solution also includes providing youth-based programs. His background information he sent to Jackson Free Press detailed his involvement in the life of young people in the city.

He said he is running for mayor to put in place creative leadership.

""Crime has spread across our city so much that our elders will not commute after dark,"" he stated. ""My crime plan requires implementing community policing, which makes Jackson Police Department a proactive Police Department versus what we currently have is a reactive Police Department.""

Jason Wells, Republican

Thirty-eight-year-old Republican Jason Wells, a Lexington, Miss., police officer who stays in Jackson, said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press that crime is first among his priorities if he becomes mayor. He promises a focus on law enforcement and to give pay raises to those not included in the Lumumba administration's pay raise. ""Combating crime is multi-faceted,"" he stated. ""Law enforcement officers along with community members have a considerable part to play."" He decries the number of police officers in the city compared to the population.

""Community members can't go silent or intentionally mislead police when questioned about crimes and those who commit them, family or not,"" he added. ""Gotta change the culture, JPD and community members. Zero tolerance ... from littering to capital murder. True accountability-Zero Tolerance culture.""

Ponto Downing, Republican

Seventy-six-year-old Ponto Downing joins Wells on the ballot on April 6 for the city-wide Republican primary election. He described himself as walking history in a written statement to the Jackson Free Press. Downing told this reporter that he distances himself from the internet but will have to use it if he becomes mayor. ""I'm running for mayor out of desperation,"" he stated. ""Someone has to do something--soon!""

""If elected all of Jackson's problems will be solved quickly!"" he added. ""But I know my odds of being Mayor are 100-1! But hopefully, Gov. Tate Reeves will intervene (and) rescue the capitol.""

At a mayoral debate presented by Women for Progress, Downing said he does not actually want to be mayor, but feels like he has to run. He also claimed without evidence that there is a ""war on white people"" in Jackson. (He is white.)

All Voters Can Vote in Primary

Jackson Election Commission Chairwoman Sanders told the Jackson Free Press that the two parties have contracted with the municipal election body to conduct the April 6 primary election after absentee voting ends on April 3. Any registered voter in the city can participate at any of the 82 precincts in the primary election without identifying as a registered Republican or Democrat, Sanders said.

""In Mississippi, a primary candidate must win a majority of the votes cast for the office he or she is seeking in order to secure the nomination,"" Ballotpedia, dubbed the digital encyclopedia of American politics and elections, stated. ""If no candidate for an office wins a majority of votes cast in the primary, a runoff election between the top two vote-getters is held.""

Any possible runoff in the election will be between the two candidates with the highest votes on a ballot. The three-way Democratic party primary may lead to a runoff if none of the candidates wins more than 50% of the cast votes. Based on this requirement, the Republican primary, which is between two people, will not go into a runoff; one of the two will get more than half.

""If you are a registered voter, and you are a registered voter within 30 days before the date of the election, you can vote, either Republican or Democrat,"" Sanders said. ""You can vote (but) you can't vote for both of them.""

Each precinct will have a Democratic Party area and a Republican Party area, and the voters will choose one of the two to vote under but not both. Election Commissioner Sanders said each precinct on primary election day will have separate tables for the two parties. ""The Democrats will have their own table, and the Republicans on the other side will have (their) own table. And you go to the one that you choose to vote in,"" Sanders said.

There is the option of write-ins to vote for someone else other than the candidates listed for the mayor and ward positions. The Republican party's primary ballot has only the mayoral position listed. It is the only position with more than one Republican candidate.

The three independent mayoral candidates will join the Democratic and Republican primary elections winners on the ballot on June 8 for the general election.

Les Tannehill, Independent

Independent candidate Tannehill, former Jackson Police Department and former Hinds County Sheriff's Department officer and business owner, said on his campaign website that rebuilding the city to ""be a safe and prosperous city is going to take partnerships.""

""I have developed many contacts and formed many relationships on the federal, state and local levels,"" he stated. ""All of which would be glad to participate in making the City of Jackson a better place for all of us and our families to live, work, play and worship.""

In a statement on his plan for the city, Tannehill said that he is running for mayor because he feels the pain of the capital city. ""In the streets of Jackson, MS I have felt the pain of dying young men, who had been shot, as I knelt beside them trying to stop the bleeding until paramedics arrived,"" he said.

""As a law enforcement officer, I felt the pain of being underpaid, under-appreciated, under-staffed and overworked,"" he added. ""I've felt the pain of the Jackson Fire Department, who worked hand-in-hand with us, face the same difficulties working tirelessly, responding to call after call.""

Shafeqah ""BigMama"" Lodree, Independent

Lodree, who runs a bail bonding business, wants to fight crime, according to a statement she provided to the Jackson Free Press on her background.

""Once elected, one of her primary focuses will be reducing crime,"" the statement said. ""Having worked in the bail industry for over a decade, she's had a bird's eye view of the plethora of flaws in the system.""

""She acknowledges the need for what she calls 'Jail Reform' and has a plan to Bail Jackson out! Appointing a competent and engaged Chief that understands the importance of maintaining a great morale in the department can drastically reduce crime in Jackson.""

She stated that she wants to reach out to registered voters who have not been turning up at the polls. ""The population of Jackson is over 150,000, and I haven't seen 50,000 people vote in municipal elections in years,"" she said. ""That lets me know that at least another 50,000 people have given up.""

Charlotte Reeves, Independent

Businesswoman Charlotte Reeves also addressed insecurity in her statement of purpose she sent to the Jackson Free Press.

""Under the Reeves leadership, the depressed, doomed and gloomy crime infested city will be revitalized,"" the past mayoral candidate stated. ""As Mayor, citizens will not have to wait another year, another term, or another 3 decades to see a positive improvement in Jackson.""

She indicated that her political relationships will help the city. ""Over her lifetime, she has watched the city fall apart. Reeves refused to give up on Jackson—a city she loves,"" the document says.

More than a Job

Forty-seven-year-old Roymon Gathrite told the Jackson Free Press at the Raceway gas station that he desires that the mayor of Jackson, after the June 8 election, will display the highest commitment.

""I expect for the next mayor of Jackson to have some concern for the city and the citizens of Jackson, not just have a position or a job,"" Gathrite told the Jackson Free Press. ""(I expect the person) to bring the city back to life, not just talk about it, but to be about it.""

""I would like to see businesses coming back to Jackson. You got less jobs in Jackson, and they're just not putting forth the effort to just get things done and put them in the right perspective,"" he added.

Painter Jake Walters, 40, said he wants a focus on the infrastructure and tighter budgeting from the mayor, while reflecting on the winter storm that exposed the city's aging water infrastructure.

""We need some help as far as the water supply goes, and some of the outlying cities around Jackson have newer infrastructure than Jackson by at least 75 years,"" Walters said. ""So we need more of our budget (going towards) fixing the pipes and making sure that we have generally quicker response time as it relates to when the power goes out or when the water goes out.""

""I'd like for the people's voice to be considered before actions are taken just on a basic level,"" he added.

He says they have been searching for water to pass out to residents, but all of the surrounding stores do not have any at all. Mayor Truly says he’s also contacted the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency for assistance, and they hope pallets of water will be available by Sunday.

Many residents have been without water since Thursday. Timothy Wright lives on Sunset Avenue. He believes the city should have been better prepared for the winter storm. ” I understand that the weather was bad, and the city has problems with its pumps, but we got a lot of elderly people around here. We got a lot of people with children. I’m sure that we got people with unknown problems that need this water. We are also going through a pandemic,” said Wright.

Mayor Truly blames the city’s aging infrastructure for the water pumps going out during the ice storm. He says crews with Canton Municipal Utilities are working around the clock to get water restored.

223,19-Feb-21,ABC News,Cities slammed by winter storms face new crisis: No water,"States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another

AUSTIN, Texas -- States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Broken water pipes brought on by record-low temperatures have created a shortage of clean drinking water, shut down airports and left hospitals scrambling.

Texas authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water due to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

And in Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 was without water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to drive to set locations to pick it up – leaving elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway, located on a hill, is a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, is running out of his heart medication, with enough to get him through Sunday, because she hasn’t been able to make it to the pharmacy to refill it.

“It would be nice to have some type of answers,” she said. “People are in dire need here. We need urgent help.”

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after ice and snow storms swept through early in the week, forcing utilities from Minnesota to Texas to implement rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids.

Texas’ grid operators said Friday that the system has returned to normal for the first time since a storm knocked out power to more than 4 million customers. Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, says the grid again has enough capacity to provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott has ordered an investigation into the failure in the energy capital of the U.S., while ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages early Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 59 people, including a Tennessee farmer trying to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond. A growing number of people have perished trying to keep warm.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams were in Texas with fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” while urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Abbott urged Texas residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect the system as the ground began to warm and pipes thaw.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state’s water outages were in north Louisiana and in the southwest city of Lake Charles, which still was struggling to recover from Hurricane Laura. He said bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to hardest-hit areas and would be focused on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers.

Edwards said he was grateful that warmer weather was forecasted across Louisiana by Saturday.

“I expect that over the next several days, we will make repairs to the water systems and get things functioning as close to normal as possible,” the governor said in a live event with the Washington Post.

224,30-Mar-21,Mississippi Today,Jackson wanted $47 million for water crisis. Lawmakers are providing $3 million.,"The city of Jackson’s request for $47 million from the state for water and sewerage repairs has fallen on deaf ears as lawmakers ink final spending plans for the coming year with only $3 million of $356 million in projects statewide earmarked for a city water plant.

But legislative leaders said they’re not ignoring the capital city’s water crisis. They said tens of millions in federal dollars coming to Mississippi from the COVID-19 American Rescue Act can go to overhauling Jackson’s crumbling infrastructure. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said the $3 million for the Jackson water plant is one of the largest individual city projects funded by the state for the coming year.

Lawmakers have approved a $298 million “Christmas tree” bond bill to borrow money for dozens of projects and economic development grants statewide, including $121 million for colleges and universities projects. They also approved $58 million in projects from the state capital expense fund. Besides the $3 million water project, there are about $1.6 million in smaller city of Jackson projects, such as $500,000 to upgrade the Pete Brown Golf Course.

After decades of neglected maintenance, Jackson’s water system is failing as the city struggles financially, largely from “white flight” loss of population and businesses to the suburbs. A recent freezing winter storm left at least 40,000 Jacksonians without running water for weeks, and the system suffers outages and boil-water notices frequently. The city is asking for state and federal help and said $1 billion in repairs are needed.

Recently, lawmakers killed a request to let Jackson voters decide whether to levy a 1-cent local sales tax in Jackson to pay for water and sewerage. Jackson already has a 1-cent local sales tax — one of only two such local sales taxes in the state — for infrastructure.

“Unfortunately, our requests have fallen on deaf ears with regard to our quality of water issues,” said Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson. “The $3 million currently allocated to the J.H. Fewell water plant … is a small deposit on the future improvements of our water treatment plant.”

Another lawmaker from Jackson, Sen. John Horhn, said he believes Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s recent public criticism of the state’s GOP leadership played a role in the city not receiving more from the state. Horhn unsuccessfully challenged Lumumba for the mayor’s seat in the 2017 Democratic city primary.

“We have an unfortunate set of circumstances where the mayor made comments that state leaders took exception to,” Horhn said. “That impacted the reception to the requests.”

Lumumba said in a New York Times interview that state government agencies and offices don’t pay for city water and sewerage, which helps put the system in a financial bind. He later retracted the statement, saying he had incorrect information and that state offices do pay for the city services.

Hosemann, a longtime Jackson resident, said the mayor’s criticism of state leaders hasn’t influenced his decision-making on city requests. But then he criticized the mayor’s comments.

“I wish he’d be accurate — the state pays its water bills,” Hosemann said. “I don’t know why he’d run down the state he lives in to the New York Times, especially when it’s not true … But his inaccurate comments did not affect funding, not with me. I live here.”

Hosemann said lawmakers considered the Fewell Plant (one of two main water plants in the city) repairs an urgent need the state could help fund directly. He said otherwise, Jackson’s water issues can be addressed with some of the $6 billion in federal Rescue Act funding Mississippi will receive.

“We’ve got $1.8 billion in federal funds coming to (the Legislature) that should be here within 120 to 180 days that can help,” Hosemann said. “… Also, the city can apply for grants from another $166 million coming for infrastructure projects … There’s $44 million coming directly to the city — the largest amount for any city in the state — and there’s another $46 million going to (Hinds) county.

“What this means is that we just need to all work together over the next three to four months and make sure things are taken care of,” Hosemann said. “… We were more generous with Jackson than anybody else (with project funding) even knowing they’ve got more coming to them (from the Rescue Act) than anybody else.”

House Ways and Means Chairman Trey Lamar, R-Senatobia, said, “No. 1, we want to help the city of Jackson. It’s as simple as that.”

Lamar said city officials and legislative leaders have been meeting and he agrees with Hosemann and others that the “unprecedented” federal funding coming to the state, city and county can solve the issues. He said the state’s congressional delegation is also working on more direct help for Jackson.

“It would make no sense for the state to borrow a bunch of money at this time for water and sewer when the city, county and state are about to get money that can be used for this,” Lamar said. “… I do believe help is on the horizon. We all want to see the city do well and we will help on the state level where we can.”

226,16-Feb-21,CNN,Officials slam grid operator as dark comes and millions remain without power,"(CNN) With approximately 1.2 million residents in the Houston area without power, a Texas official slammed the company that runs the electric grid, saying: ""The bottom line this evening is, we're in for another long night.""

The National Weather Service office in Houston was predicting rain and freezing rain Tuesday night with temperatures in the 20s.

Harris County Judge Lena Hidalgo said it has been a natural disaster and a man-made one as well. She was one of several officials from the state calling for answers from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, a grid operator that controls about 90% of the state's electric load.

""Every night since this started, we've seen less generation, not more,"" Hidalgo said. ""So, let me give it to you straight based on the visibility I have -- whether you have power or not right now, there is a possibility of power outages even beyond the length of this weather.""

About 3.3 million homes and businesses were without power in Texas on Tuesday evening as a result of freezing temperatures and a deadly winter storm that swept into the state early this week. The entire state saw temperatures below freezing during at least parts of Monday and Tuesday, and utilities have been knocked out or frozen over by the bitter cold -- leaving many without primary means of heating their homes.

ERCOT said it expected to restore electricity service to some customers Tuesday afternoon, but ""the amount we restore will depend on how much generation is actually able to come online.""

ERCOT CEO Bill Magness said his company averted a total disaster.

""I think from the perspective of the grid collapsing, I think what has happened here is a response that kept the grid from collapsing, that kept us from going into a blackout condition,"" he said. ""Now the difficulties that this has imposed on the citizens of Texas, everybody in the state, have been enormous.""

Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and the Texas speaker of the house were among those calling for a look into how ERCOT dealt with the storm.

Abbott said he wants an investigation and swift reform of the system.

""The Electric Reliability Council of Texas has been anything but reliable over the past 48 hours,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""Far too many Texans are without power and heat for their homes as our state faces freezing temperatures and severe winter weather. This is unacceptable.""

Responding to the governor, Magness said the company sees the need for an investigation.

""Electricity is an essential service,"" said Magness. ""As we do the event analysis after this is over, once we get through the emergency and we get customers back on, we want to participate in that, we want to learn lessons, because if, you know, there's mistakes that we can be correcting, you want to find them, and we want to put the processes in to correct them.""

Galveston County Judge Mark Henry said ERCOT officials were less than forthcoming with information ahead of the deadly storm that has left much of his county battling power outages and freezing temperatures.

""We were told Sunday afternoon in a message that there'll be rolling blackouts, about up to an hour off, and then up to three to four hours on,"" he said. ""That was fine. That didn't happen. The power went off, it stayed off. We had no rolling blackouts at all in this county.""

He said county officials would have made different decisions, including calling for people to evacuate, if they had been told the power was going to stay off.

Three die in carbon monoxide incidents

Frigid temperatures and widespread power outages plagued swaths of Texas for the third straight day Tuesday, sending numerous residents to vehicles, fireplaces and shelters in desperate search of warmth.

In the town of Nevada outside Dallas, Clint Cash said he's resorted to living in his car parked in an open area outside his home, which had largely been without power since Sunday evening when temperatures dipped into the teens

""I'm wearing several layers of clothes to keep my body warm"" and using heat from his vehicle, Cash, 44, told CNN affiliate KTVT on Monday

The cold is believed to have contributed to at least three deaths in the Houston area alone, police said. That includes a woman and a girl who died of carbon monoxide poisoning after a car was running in the garage at their home to create heat because the power was out, Houston police said Tuesday morning

Another person died in Fort Worth from a carbon monoxide incident, according to fire officials there.

The Harris County fire marshal's office, meanwhile, has reports that more than 50 people have suffered carbon monoxide poisoning relating to heating issues during the cold spell, Hidalgo said.

Treacherous weather conditions have led to more than 550 car crashes in the area since Sunday, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said.

""Our roadways are still very icy. Please avoid traveling unless absolutely necessary,"" Acevedo said on Twitter

Huge electricity demand

Officials have said some utilities' ability to generate the power has been frozen -- including natural gas and coal generators. said intentional, rolling power blackouts will happen in parts of the state to balance huge demand with struggling supply

Temperatures are expected to be below freezing throughout Tuesday in roughly the state's northern half, and they may just reach above it in Houston and San Antonio, according to a National Weather Service forecast

While snow has fallen across much of Texas, more snow and ice are expected for much of the state through Wednesday as part of a larger storm system

Up to 6 more inches of snow could fall in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, while freezing rain is forecast for Austin, San Antonio and Houston.

""We're looking at some more rain and sleet tonight,"" San Antonio Fire Chief Charles Hood said. ""This could be the worst night as far as temperature.""

Hood said his department has had a rough week with the storm, ""We had 2,608 calls for service yesterday. We did about four times the number of calls we do on a normal day.""

A truck braves the frozen roads in Houston on Monday, February 15.

Relying on fireplaces and generators

Barbara Martinez had a mission Tuesday that she wouldn't normally undertake: find more wood for the fireplace that has become her home's main source of heat in freezing weather.

Her home in the Houston suburb of Jersey Village has been largely without power since Sunday at 3 a.m., she told CNN.

She, her elderly parents, and her two dogs have been huddled together in one room with a fireplace.

""We have several layers of clothing and it's cold,"" Martinez said. ""We've been using our cars to charge up phones, and (the) signal here is nearly impossible to use.""

""We hope the power comes back soon because we are running out of firewood,"" she said. ""My goal today is to find more firewood.""

Barbara Martinez's father sits in front of the fireplace at her home in a Houston suburb.

In the Fort Worth suburb of Watauga, Elijah Dorminy's family has depended on their generator to make it through the deadly cold -- and he fears that soon even that won't be an option.

Dorminy, his wife and their four children were worried what will happen when they need to refill their generator with gas again. Only one gas station still had fuel in Watauga, Dorminy told CNN on Monday evening.

""Pray for us, this is going to be rough,"" he told CNN.

Water shut off in Abilene, and cell phone service interrupted outside Houston

The city of Abilene said it was forced to shut off water service Monday evening because of a power outage at three water treatment plants.

The city of about 120,000 people is about a 150-mile drive west of Fort Worth.

Power has since been restored to one water plant and crews are working toward the goal of restoring service to most of the city by day's end Tuesday, officials said

When service is restored, a boil water notice will be in effect, and customers should bring water to a vigorous boil for at least two minutes before consumption, according to the statement.

""Texans with electricity are asked to conserve as much as possible in an effort to relieve the demand on the state's power grid and help restore service,"" the city said.

In Waco, Mayor Dillon Meek said the city would rent 15 hotel rooms for homeless people.

Covid-19 vaccines and appointments at risk

The storm has complicated Covid-19 vaccinations, causing appointments to be postponed and threatening supplies.

No first-dose vaccines were being shipped to the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District on Monday and Tuesday because of winter weather, according to a news release.

San Antonio postponed vaccine appointments scheduled for the Alamodome stadium until Saturday, according to a news release from the city.

""With the current icy conditions expected to remain until at least tomorrow, we want to ensure the safety of the public. We also want to remind the public who may be concerned about the small delay for their second dose, that we are still within CDC guidelines to ensure the vaccine will still work with no issues,"" the release stated.

After power was lost at the Harris County Public Health building and backup generators failed, officials had to race to allocate and save 8,400 vaccines before they spoiled, Hidalgo, the county judge, said Monday.

Harris County officials settled on Houston's Ben Taub, Lyndon B. Johnson and Houston Methodist Hospitals, as well as Rice University and the Harris County Jail as the locations to receive the vaccine overnight, Hidalgo said.","Hide Caption 10 of 55 Photos: Winter storms wreaking havoc in the US Snow falls in New York's Times Square on Thursday.

227,3-Mar-21,Forbes,"Over 250,000 Still Without Clean Water In Homes After Winter Storms","Topline

The impacts of winter storms and a historic cold snap that took place well over two weeks ago are continuing to be felt for a large population across the South, as infrastructure systems largely unprepared for the cold are still recovering from the massive blow.

Hundreds of thousands are still without clean water in their homes as a result of winter ... [+] storms--weeks after the record cold snap. getty

Key Facts

Between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi—the states most impacted in terms of water—more than 250,000 people remain without direct access to clean water in homes, either due to water outages or boil water advisories. In Jackson, Mississippi, more than half of schools remained closed for in-person learning due to inadequate water pressure. Officials in the city do not know how many residents still have water outages and do not know when those outages might be restored. There are still even some without power from the winter storms, though most are far from Texas, where millions went without electricity in the record cold. More than 1,000 customers remain without power in areas of southern West Virginia, some of whom have gone without electricity since an ice storm on Feb. 11, during the first in a series of major winter storms to hit the South, days before the largest of the storms devastated Texas. Restoration efforts for the small pockets without power have been slowed because of flooding in recent days.

Key Background

A series of winter storms bringing snow, ice and record cold hit large swaths of the South over the course of about a week during mid-February, bringing some areas that can go years without snow and ice multiple events in just a matter of days. By far the most widespread impacts were in Texas, where the state's electric grid was pushed to the brink of total failure, leading to rolling blackouts that left millions in the dark and without access to heat during cold temperatures which in many cases broke records that had stood for over a century.

What To Watch For

The mass outages in Texas are now subject to investigations on both the state and federal levels. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) on Feb. 19, while House Oversight Environment Subcommittee Chairman Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) sent a letter to ERCOT CEO Bill Magness Wednesday requesting documents relating to its winter weather preparedness.

Surprising Fact

Temperatures quickly rebounded after the deep freeze. Some areas that dealt with record lows and days of temperatures mostly below freezing had highs in the 80s just over a week later.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — The sunshine is back, and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their residents.

Families stood in lines for hours to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

“You don’t realize how much you use water until you don’t have it,” said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region’s water mains, froze equipment and left millions without service, it’s clear just how much work needs to be done.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described “chronic, long-term and insufficient investment.” The report warned that the “nation’s public health and the economy will be at risk.”

Actually, it’s already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, residents in the city of 650,000 were told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they planned to use it for drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth. The boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. Nearly 25,000 Louisianans still had water outages Thursday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are “nonoperational,” affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation’s fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi’s majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams, 67, went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson’s water problem a public health crisis.

“The wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,” the retired public works department employee said. “It’s not their concern because they don’t live here no more.”

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

“These pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,” he said. “They’ll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they’ll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.”

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, 68, collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

“The vulnerable are left behind,” she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to “old, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.”

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins’ bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city’s 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.

233,17-Feb-21,WLBT,"Temperatures, transportation issues limiting Jackson’s water treatment efforts","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Jackson city officials are facing multiple challenges with its water system, thanks to the recent winter storm.

Public Works Director Charles Williams outlined problems at Wednesday’s special council meeting.

He said that the low temperatures have caused problems at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility, while transportation problems are slowing down the city’s efforts to bring in treatment chemicals for the J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Facility.

Williams was not sure when the problems would be solved and said they could be made worse by the additional winter weather expected to come in Wednesday.

“I can’t tell you when we’ll get the pressure back to where we need it to be,” he said. “It will be an ongoing issue.”

A winter storm ripped across the state earlier this week, bringing with it freezing rain and sleet and dropping temperatures to below freezing. Many roads were frozen over and closed as a result and remained closed Wednesday.

Seeing the incoming weather, the city took steps to fill tanks and shore up the water treatment equipment at the plants, but the efforts fell flat.

“The water temperature at the reservoir is around 48 degrees. When you get to those types of temperatures, you get mechanical issues at the plant, which we have resolved,” he told the council. “The temperature of the water causes the chemicals to do what they’re not supposed to do. We’re having to do a lot of backwashing with the filters and having to (take) additional measures to keep water in the distribution system.”

Meanwhile, the city is facing difficulty in bringing in additional treatment chemicals for the Fewell plant. “We’re trying to get chemicals out of Monticello. We’re working with a driving company, but transportation has been limited,” Williams said.

Director of Constituent Services Keyshia Sanders said she’s experienced similar problems in trying to bring in trucks to help distribute water.

She had hoped to set up distribution centers to help residents who have temporarily lost water service at their homes.

“I have been in talks with a couple of different companies about providing water ... but because of highway closures, trucks are not able to come in to make deliveries,” she said.

Sanders is now hoping to bring in a tanker truck so the city can at least provide non-potable water to residents for flushing toilets, washing clothes and the like. It was unclear when that would happen, with some roads still impassible Wednesday afternoon.

Meanwhile, residents like Gail Thomas are frustrated with the outage. She said she called the city to find out when water would be restored and was the told the same thing Williams told the council - it was unknown.

“It’s a health issue to not have running water,” Thomas said. “These officials ... don’t seem to know what they’re doing and do not have any customer service (toward) us, the taxpayers who pay them.”

Williams is asking residents to have patience. “We’re just in some very difficult times because of this weather and we’re trying to get ourselves out of it.”

236,18-Feb-21,WJTV,"Crews work to repair pipes, power lines in Vicksburg","VICKSBURG, Miss. (WJTV) – A lack of running water and power outages are the top two problems left by this week’s ice storm in Warren County and Vicksburg. Public works crews had to wait until Thursday morning to find out where the major water main breaks were in the city.

As far as Entergy Mississippi customers go, more than 6,200 homes and businesses were without power on Thursday. Running water is slowly coming back for homeowners in some areas in Vicksburg.

Crews were able to find one of the water main breaks at the Vicksburg Forest Production Yard, where the fire prevention system came loose. Water gushed out of the ceilings, pipes and walls in several buildings.

“If anyone in the City of Vicksburg sees any amount of water leaking from a City street or City water main, please report it to me immediately by calling my cell phone — 601.942.0492. These unidentified leaks are causing our water pressure to remain low across the City,” said Mayor George Flaggs.

Ice also weighted down electrical wires in the city and county. It forced neighbors to turn to canned foods and boxed snacks all day, while wearing layers inside their homes. Most lost power Wednesday evening.

“I left the house going to get some gas cans filled up to power the generator. The roads were a little better than they were yesterday, so I’m getting out and about. Power went out yesterday afternoon, so I got gas logs fireplace which are heating pretty good. So we’re cooking on a grill outside,” said Paul Harbin, who lives in Warren County.

239,15-Mar-21,WLBT,"Fire hydrant shut off, restoring water to Jackson businesses without it for weeks","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Some businesses in west Jackson are now back to full operations after a running fire hydrant was shut off. It took weeks for the city to address the situation, which left several companies without water.

Thousands of gallons of water were wasted during the outage while the problem was being assessed.

“They literally spent 30 seconds fixing it,” said Denver Tatum. He said water was rushing from a ruptured fire hydrant for weeks before the city finally turned it off.

During that time his business, S&R Metal Company, and others on Lena Street had no running water. City crews arrived Tuesday after we spoke with Tatum.

“They just closed the valve,” said the Jackson business owner. “They stuck their arm down in the fire hydrant main, closed the valve and it’s fixed. It took them 15 days to close a valve.”

A construction company is also on the street. Tatum said that company has been doing what it can to make the street passable when the city makes repeated water line repairs.

“The construction company down the street did all the repairs for us,” added Tatum. “That’s the last water pipe repair that the city made last October,” he said pointing to an orange cone on the street. “The city didn’t even back fill it. They made the repair and put a little bit of dirt on it and left and then [the construction company] came and put gravel and asphalt on it so we can drive on it.”

Water has been restored to nearby businesses on Medgar Evers Boulevard. But it is still slow going for some homes in the area.

Residents on Carnation Street said they have low water pressure which is better than the trickle from faucets two weeks ago.

Meanwhile, businesses like S&R Metal are glad to have running water again, but not happy about the amount wasted while some residents were going without it.

240,18-Feb-21,PBS,Some power restored in Texas but water woes persist,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Power was restored to more homes and businesses in Texas on Thursday after a deadly blast of winter this week overwhelmed the electrical grid and left millions shivering in the cold. But the crisis was far from over, with many people still in need of safe drinking water.

Fewer than a half-million homes remained without electricity, although utility officials said limited rolling blackouts could still occur.

The storms also left more than 320,000 homes and businesses without power in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. About 70,000 power outages persisted after an ice storm in eastern Kentucky, while nearly 67,000 were without electricity in West Virginia.

Snow and ice moved into the Appalachians, northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania, and later the Northeast. Back-to-back storms left 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow in Little Rock, Arkansas, tying a 1918 record, the National Weather Service said.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of over three dozen people, some while trying to keep warm. In the Houston area, one family died from carbon monoxide as their car idled in their garage. A woman and her three grandchildren were killed in a fire that authorities said might have been caused by a fireplace they were using.

In Texas on Thursday, just under 500,000 homes and businesses remained without power, down from about 3 million a day earlier. The state’s grid manager, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the remaining outages are largely weather-related, rather than forced blackouts that began Monday to stabilize the power grid.

“We will keep working around the clock until every single customer has their power back on,” said ERCOT Senior Director of System Operations Dan Woodfin.

WATCH: Texas Gov. Greg Abbott gives update on state response to winter power outages

Woodfin warned that rotating outages could return if electricity demand rises as people get power and heating back, though they wouldn’t last as long as outages earlier this week.

Adding to the state’s misery, the weather jeopardized drinking water systems. Authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it, following record low temperatures that damaged infrastructure and pipes.

Water pressure fell after lines froze, and many people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing over, said Toby Baker, executive director of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Gov. Greg Abbott urged residents to shut off water to their homes, if possible, to prevent more busted pipes and preserve pressure in municipal systems.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he expects that residents in the nation’s fourth-largest city will have to boil tap water before drinking it until Sunday or Monday.

Some Austin hospitals lost water pressure and heat. But because the problem was statewide and affected other facilities, “no one hospital currently has the capacity to accept transport of a large number of patients,” said David Huffstutler, CEO of St. David’s South Austin Medical Center.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water but still treated patients, with most non-emergency surgeries and procedures canceled for Thursday and possibly Friday, and burst pipes were repaired as they happened, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Emergency rooms were crowded “due to patients being unable to meet their medical needs at home without electricity,” Smith said.

Texas Children’s Hospital’s main campus at the Texas Medical Center and another location had low water pressure, but the system was adequately staffed and patients had enough water and “are safe and comfortable,” spokeswoman Jenn Jacome said.

FEMA sent generators to support water treatment plants, hospitals and nursing homes in Texas, along with thousands of blankets and ready-to-eat meals, officials said. The Texas Restaurant Association also said it was coordinating donations of food to hospitals.

Weather-related outages also hit Oregon, where some have been without power for nearly a week. A Portland supermarket threw perishable food into the trash, leading to a clash between scavengers and police.

The damage to the power system was the worst in 40 years, said Maria Pope, CEO of Portland General Electric. At the peak of the storm, more than 350,000 customers in the Portland area were in the dark, and more than 100,000 Oregon customers remained without power Thursday.

Utilities from Minnesota to Texas implemented rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids. Southwest Power Pool, a group of utilities covering 14 states from the Dakotas to the Texas Panhandle, said rolling blackouts were no longer needed, but it asked customers to conserve energy until at least 10 p.m. Saturday.

The weather also disrupted water systems in several Southern cities, including New Orleans and Shreveport, Louisiana, where fire trucks delivered water to hospitals and bottled water was brought in for patients and staff, Shreveport television station KSLA reported.

Power was cut to a New Orleans facility that pumps drinking water from the Mississippi River. A spokeswoman for the Sewerage and Water Board said on-site generators were used until electricity was restored.

Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt pleaded with residents to limit water usage, and Jackson, Mississippi, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said most customers were without water, with no timeline on when it would be restored. At least 19,000 residents were without power there.

As the storms marched east, 12 people had to be rescued Wednesday night from boats after a dock weighed down by snow and ice collapsed on Tennessee’s Cumberland River, the Nashville Fire Department said. Elsewhere in the state, a 9-year-old boy was killed when the tube his father was pulling behind an ATV slammed into a mailbox.

A 69-year-old Arkansas man was found dead Wednesday after falling into a frozen pond while trying to rescue a calf. In Kentucky, a 77-year-old woman was found dead of likely hypothermia Wednesday night after two days without power and heat.

A man fell through the ice on the Detroit River on Wednesday night and likely drowned, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said. The man walked onto the ice just off Belle Isle, Michigan, about 5 p.m. and began “jumping up and down,” Lt. Jeremiah Schiessel said. Crews were unable to reach the spot where the man was last seen because the ice was too thin, Schiessel said.

Before the wintry weather moved on, parts of Texas got more snow.

Del Rio, along the U.S.-Mexico border, got nearly 10 inches (25.4 cm) Thursday, surpassing the city’s one-day record for snowfall. City officials asked residents to conserve electricity.

Up to 3 inches (7.6 cm) were forecast for San Antonio, and Mayor Ron Nirenberg urged residents to stay off treacherous roads.

243,19-Feb-21,,Winter Weather Exacts Tough Toll On Mississippi,"Winter Weather Exacts Tough Toll On Mississippi

A winter storm has hit Mississippi particularly hard. Power is out in many places, streets are iced over and water is in short supply.

AUDIE CORNISH, HOST:

Much of Mississippi has been hit by freezing weather all week, and parts of that state are still iced over. That's led to power outages, a lack of drinking water and lots of accidents on the road. We have Kobee Vance of Mississippi Public Broadcasting on the line giving us the latest from Jackson. And Kobee, to start, what's it like where you are right now?

KOBEE VANCE, BYLINE: Well, I'm actually one of the lucky ones. I have power, but that's not like most people on my street. Just down the road, my grandparents don't have power, and they live less than a mile away. Across the state, it's been tough. Several hundred thousand Mississippians are without power - have been without power at some point during this week, but it's gotten a bit better recently.

A lot of people haven't been able to leave their homes all week because their driveways and streets are iced over. And that's the main problem where I live. You see, you got to remember, this is the Deep South, a region unaccustomed to dealing with weather like this, not just for drivers, but the infrastructure to handle these extreme temperatures and ice accumulation.

CORNISH: How is this different from what's going on in Texas and what have you been hearing from officials about getting power back?

VANCE: Yeah. So in Texas, they faced what was, like, rolling blackouts because they faced terrible issues with their infrastructure and power plants being overwhelmed. In Mississippi, that hasn't been the same issue. We did have some rolling power outages on Tuesday night, but that was very limited and only a couple hours long.

Our main problem has been power line damage. That's ice on power lines and limbs that have been covered in ice falling on the power lines and even cars that are veering off the road, hitting power poles. That means that there's a lot of work to do block by block for linemen and other workers coming into the state, and that might take a while. And it's not easy. Here's Mara Hartmann of Entergy Mississippi, one of the state's largest power providers, talking about the situation here in Jackson, the state's capital.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARA HARTMANN: Some of it is off road. You need specialized equipment. We have trees down. Those have to be cleared out first. In the metro area, there's a lot of times the lines go behind houses, and we have to get specialized derricks where you can't fit a bucket truck.

CORNISH: I want to follow up on the issue of the water supply. What's the latest on that?

VANCE: Well, Mississippi is a largely rural state, so there can be big distances between homes, and lots of potential problems can crop up for lines between those connections. You know, even here in the metro area, like, areas like Jackson, there's a lot of problems. You see people have either no water or very limited water supplies right now, especially here in the Jackson area. And there's several different reasons for that - and also power outages.

Water pressure has become greatly reduced and that means bacteria can get in the lines. And if that's happening, people have to boil their water. The city's also struggling to produce enough water from the - to fill the tanks. That can be coming from the Ross Barnett Reservoir to - just because that ice is so cold right now. And also, the city needs chemicals to treat the water. And sometimes those come on big trucks that can't drive on the state's interstates right now because the icy roads and hills.

CORNISH: What's the weather outlook at this point?

VANCE: Well, looking (inaudible), things are a bit - things are going to get a bit better. There's a light at the end of the tunnel there. Temperatures are supposed to rise, and workers are supposed to get out there and try to repair lines as much as they can. But there's still going to be a lot of difficulty getting into those difficult-to-reach spaces to help make those repairs and get Mississippians back online. We're not out of the woods yet.

CORNISH: That's Kobee Vance with Mississippi Public Broadcasting.

Thank you for reporting during this hardship.

VANCE: Thank you all for having me.

244,22-Mar-21,Reuters,Breakingviews - Banks’ climate pledges suffer from water scarcity,"Deon Sanders fills a flush water container at a public water distribution site after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, some going into their third week, in Jackson, Mississippi, U.S. March 4, 2021.

MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - World Water Day on Monday should be right up the finance industry’s canal. This year’s theme dives into how to value the resource, from equality of access to cultural issues. But the opportunity to address water’s financial worth is one Wall Street and its brethren ought not to let float by.

Banks from Morgan Stanley to Wells Fargo to HSBC, barely mention it at all in their net-zero ambitions unveiled in recent months. Mostly they discuss financing clean-energy projects, stopping funding coal and Arctic drilling, and when they’ll set industry-specific goals.

Water’s apparent absence is unfortunate: Its treatment, delivery and use account for a good slug of greenhouse-gas emissions: for example, 5% in the United Kingdom, 10% in California and half in Australia’s state of Victoria, according to official data. JPMorgan did include clean water as one of several green projects in line for $50 billion of financing last year. That’s a drop in the ocean compared to the World Resource Institute’s estimate that $1 trillion a year is needed globally to ensure a sustainable supply.

Spending is required to build resilience to rising temperatures. That’s crucial as nine out of 10 climate-related natural disasters manifest through water – like the worst floods in 60 years ravaging parts of Australia; or the varying degrees of drought across almost half the United States. U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres in January called for half of climate finance to be devoted to adapting to such events.

There are examples for lenders to follow. Australian insurer IAG recently refused to back raising the walls of Sydney’s biggest dam. With more water currently cascading over the top than at Africa’s Victoria Falls, according to Stuart Khan at the University of New South Wales, that may seem wrongheaded. But the aim was to prevent further risky development in the floodplains.

So banks could refuse to offer financing or advice where climate change is worsening water scarcity, unless independently verified best practices are met. There are financial benefits: Companies responding to investor lobby group CDP’s water survey this month said the cost of ignoring such problems was five times higher than the expense of fixing them. Helping industries from agribusiness to mining to manufacturing up their water game could help banks plug their own sustainable-finance hole.","MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - World Water Day on Monday should be right up the finance industry’s canal.

245,1 month ago,Jackson Free Press,"Hinds County Removes Public Works Director; Water Supply Disrupted in Jackson, Byram","The Hinds County Board of Supervisors did not renew Interim Public Works Director Thelman Boyd’s contract, opting to appoint County Engineering Manager Charles Sims in the interim. At its Monday, May 17, meeting, Board President and District 3 Supervisor Credell Calhoun brought up Boyd's one-year contract, which lapsed in April, and introduced the motion not to renew the contract. He also asked County Administrator Kenneth Wayne Jones to advertise for the position.



District 1 Supervisor Robert Graham and District 2 Supervisor David Archie said Calhoun's move blindsided them and then brought forth counter motions in opposition but were unsuccessful each time.

""I make a substitute motion in this matter, and my substitute motion is that Mr. Boyd stays in position until we get to hire a full-time public works director,"" Archie said before the vote on the motion not to renew Boyd's contract. ""I think it is incumbent on us to be good stewards as elected officials to make sure that the citizens of Hinds County are taken care of.""

Graham said he believes that Boyd has done a great job since his appointment and asked Calhoun to explain the rationale for his move, which he declined to do.

""I'd like to say that I thought that, and I still believe that Mr. Boyd has done a great job and is doing a great job,"" Graham said. ""And I want to go on the record as supporting him and what he has done. I have no idea as to why this contract is not being renewed for any particular reason.""

""I want to make sure that Mr. Boyd and everyone else gets due process as it relates to when they've done wrong or what they've done right,"" he added. ""I don't know, Mr. President, if you thought that he'd done something wrong, but I think that it could have been better for the board to be unified in what we are doing or why we are doing it, and he deserves an explanation.""

Archie said his surprise at the move was because he believes Boyd has been ""getting things done"" and does not recall the board questioning his ability.

""I think that when he gets before us on his mic here, that that is the time to question his ability to do his duties,"" he said. ""I haven't seen any of that taking place. The only thing that I have seen that's taking place is the motion that was just made. And I don't think that was a due process, not based upon the performance of the employee of Hinds County.""

After Calhoun, District 4 Supervisor Vern O. Gavin and District 5 Supervisor Bobby ""Bobcat"" McGowan voted to not renew Boyd's contract, Calhoun introduced the motion to appoint Sims as interim public works director. But Archie put up a substitute motion ""for Hinds County not to rehire anybody that works for Hinds County to take over the position of public works."" That motion failed to garner the three votes needed to succeed, with Graham casting the only supporting vote with the others voting no.

After Calhoun set the effective date as immediately for the appointment of Sims as interim public works director, Graham made a substitute motion to ""make the effective date after another individual has been hired."" That motion also failed.

Water Supply Disruption in Jackson and Byram

Thousands of people in south Jackson and Byram are continuing to suffer low or no water pressure as the Siwell Road well system and TV Road well system are offline.

City of Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said at a media briefing on Tuesday, May 18, that contractors are working on the Siwell Road well system and might not see a resolution before Friday, May 21. He urged the affected residents to continue to conserve water. The City organized water distribution at 4 pm. on Tuesday at Siwell Road Middle School located at 1983 N Siwell Road in Jackson.

""As of this morning, the city of Jackson currently has four wells that are operating. TV Road and Siwell Road wells are currently offline,"" Williams said. ""Siwell Road is one of our large wells, and we are concentrating our efforts right now on that repair, and then we're moving on to TV Road.""

""Right now, we're basically assessing the situation while the contractors onsite are starting to break the well down to determine the actual cause of the failure,"" he added. ""We also anticipate having a mitigation plan in place that we can quickly make the repair in order to have water restored to that area of Siwell Road by Friday. And that will be the best-case scenario, and then we'll move to TV Road.""

He said that those affected include TV Road, Maddox Road, Raymond Road, Highway 18, South Siwell Road, Terry Road and Spingridge Road, which add to 2,000 connections.

""Those areas right now are probably experiencing low water pressure, which will continue to fluctuate over the next two days while we make the repairs to Siwell Road well system,"" the public works director said.

""Earlier today, the Department of Public Works reported that one of the wells on the Jackson Maddox Well System near TV Road was offline. Both a precautionary boil water advisory and a conservation notice were issued for the impacted areas. As of this evening, a second well at Siwell Road is also offline. As a result, the Jackson Maddox Well System is currently operating on four wells,"" Communications Manager Michelle Atoa wrote in a statement on Monday.

The City said on its Facebook page Tuesday that the Jackson Maddox Well System serves about 16,000 water connections concentrated in south Jackson and the City of Byram. ""As the system continues to operate on only four wells, customers, particularly those at higher elevations, can expect to experience low or no water pressure in the impacted areas near these wells,” the post said. ""The precautionary boil water advisory issued on Monday, May 17, as a result of the TV Road well disruption will be expanded to also include areas impacted by the Siwell Road well disruption.""

The City has suffered two earlier disruptions in its water system in 2021. The February winter storm caused widespread outages; in April, a fire outbreak at OB Curtis Water treatment Plant affected many households.

250,13-Feb-21,The Vicksburg Post,"Emergency officials ahead of winter storm: Pray for the best, prepare for the worst - The Vicksburg Post","It is simple. Stay home.

The winter storm, forecast to roll through Warren County late Sunday into Monday, is being considered a dangerous event — so much so that emergency officials are urging residents to prepare now to remain home beginning Sunday and into Tuesday.

“It is going to be a significant winter weather event,” Warren County Emergency Management Agency Director John Elfer said. “We are going to have power outages. Trees are going to fall and roads are going to be impassable at times.”

According to the National Weather Service in Jackson, Warren County — and much of central Mississippi through the Delta — should expect “significant accumulation of ice and sleet. Travel conditions will be dangerous with road potentially impassable,” the warning from the Weather Service said. “Additionally, where precipitation is predominately freezing rain: numerous trees and limbs will be downed. Expect numerous power outages, possibly lasting days.”

Weather officials also warned residents to expect low temperatures Monday in the single digits, with wind chills below zero. The service also said hypothermia and frostbite are likely with “prolonged exposure” and “damage to exposed pipes and water main breaks are expected.”

Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace, whose department responded to numerous ice-related accidents Friday, said those poor conditions are only just the beginning.

“We had issues Friday night from icing. That was just a precursor of what is predicted to be here Sunday and Monday,” Pace said. “My plea to the public is to stay home if you do not absolutely need to get out. If you do have to get out, please be careful. Drive slowly, approach bridges and overpasses with caution and remember to not brake or accelerate on icy bridges.”

While not near the severity of what is expected in the coming days, Friday’s weather, sadly, did prove to be deadly.

While responding to an accident that had already occurred at mile marker 11 on Interstate 20 westbound, local tow truck operator George Spratley Jr., 44, was killed when another vehicle, traveling near the accident, lost control on the icy roadway and collided with Spratley’s tow truck.

According to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, Spratley, a Bovina resident, died as a result of his injuries.

“I had the opportunity to work alongside Spratley for many years. He was always very professional, efficient and a pleasure to work with,” Pace said. “He will be missed both professionally and personally.”

Pace said Spratley’s death, along with the numerous accidents that already took place in less severe conditions than what is forecast for Sunday and Monday, should serve as a reminder of how serious local residents should take this impending storm.

Entergy Mississippi said it is expecting the winter storm to impact all of its 45-county service area.

“We continually watch the weather and put our plan in action as soon as a severe weather threat emerges,” said Lea Turnipseed, Entergy Mississippi vice president of customer service. “We encourage customers to form a storm-preparedness plan before severe weather appears. Waiting until a storm arrives may be too late.”

Pace said his department has already taken additional steps to prepare for the storm’s arrival.

“All of our vehicles are fueled and serviced, all days off have been canceled,” Pace said. “We will have extra manpower out throughout the weekend and into next week. All we can do now is pray for the best and prepare for the worst.”

255,19-Feb-21,PBS,Lights come back on in Texas as water woes rise in the South,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — States slammed by winter storms that left millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Broken water pipes brought on by record-low temperatures have created a shortage of clean drinking water, shut down airports on Friday and left hospitals scrambling.

Texas authorities ordered 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of to water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

And in Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said

WATCH: After brutalizing much of the U.S., storm surge shines a spotlight on disparities

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” Lumumba said.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to drive to pick it up – leaving elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, is running out of his heart medication, with only enough to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to make it to the pharmacy to refill it.

“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after ice and snow storms swept through early in the week, forcing utilities from Minnesota to Texas to implement rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids.

Texas’ grid operators said Friday that the state’s electrical system returned to normal for the first time since a storm knocked out power to more than 4 million customers. Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now has enough capacity to provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure in the energy capital of the U.S., while ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages early Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 59 people, including a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond. A growing number of people have perished as they struggled to keep warm.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning,” urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state’s 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Abbott urged Texas residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

Two of Houston Methodist’s community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokeswoman Gale Smith.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect the system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was at “critically low” levels and also asked its customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building — causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tougued skunk lizard.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state’s water outages were in the northern part of the state and in the southwestern city of Lake Charles, which is struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas and with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Edwards said.

Edwards said he was grateful that warmer weather was forecasted across Louisiana by Saturday.

“I expect that over the next several days, we will make repairs to the water systems and get things functioning as close to normal as possible,” the governor said in a live event with the Washington Post.

In the community of Hackberry near Lake Charles, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and put up her two daughters in another home.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.

President Joe Biden has vowed to address the country’s crumbling water infrastructure, but the recent winter storms prove Americans must take water safety into their own hands.

Americans in Texas, Mississippi and Tennessee were advised to boil drinking water after pipelines froze and burst, leaving tap water unsafe to consume. Many were forced to stand in long lines hoping to get a case of water from the National Guard or Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Jackson, Mississippi, reported 96 water main breaks and leaks that left at least 40,000 homes without running water for weeks.

Mississippi state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, whose family was without water for more than two weeks, blamed the city’s crumbling pipelines. ""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,” Crudup said. “This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Residents in Memphis faced a similar experience. According to the Associated Press, boil water advisories across the city affected over 250,000 customers after pipes, including some that hadn’t been replaced since the 1930s, burst. Even after the advisory was lifted, some say their water looked “muddy” and gave off a foul odor. The county continued to provide bottled water across 20 distribution sites for weeks.

Nearly 15 million Texans—about half the state's population—were without access to clean drinking water at the peak of the water crisis on Feb. 19. Not only did freezing temperatures cause water main breaks, but widespread power outages forced water treatment plants offline.

And even after the worst of the storm passed, problems still lingered. As of March 1, approximately 390,000 Texans were still being told to boil their water.

A break every two minutes

According to the American Society of Civil Engineer’s 2021 Infrastructure Report Card, America’s aging water systems experience an estimated 250,000 to 300,000 water main breaks each year. That’s equivalent to one break every two minutes. Hundreds of thousands of people are sickened by bad water daily.

Biden has vowed to invest $3 trillion into renovating our country’s crumbling infrastructure—including eliminating aging lead pipes and upgrading water quality monitoring technologies.

This plan will expand on current grant programs managed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, including one 2020 program that awarded over $17 million to provide training and technical assistance to small public water and wastewater systems.

A nationwide fix won’t happen overnight. Biden took a good first step by meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office to discuss infrastructure. But his plan could face an uphill battle in the Senate. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, said he will block the $3 trillion package if Republicans are not included in the conversation. We could be looking at weeks, months or even years before a proper infrastructure bill sees the light of day—and even then, it'll take years to fix everything.

Stay prepared

For the foreseeable future, families need to protect themselves. FEMA recommends families store a gallon of bottled water, per person, per day with enough water for a two-week supply. Additionally, families should look up their local water utility’s test results online to see if their tap water meets health guidelines during normal times.

A fluid ounce of prevention is worth a gallon of cure.

267,31-Mar-21,WLBT,"Jackson city leaders say they’ll build a new water treatment plant, if it’s funded","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - Jackson city leaders say they’ll build a new water treatment plant if the feds come up with the funds to help pay for it.

Tuesday, the council approved an order to consider building a new plant, or as an alternative, restore the existing plant, if funds become available.

The order was passed unanimously and was designed to show the federal government the city’s intent to add a new treatment plant if Congress allocates the money.

It does not mean, however, that construction on a new plant is about to begin, but simply states that the city would build a new plant if it receives the funding to do so.

“We are hoping that the U.S. senator will come through with her promise to help Jackson,” Ward Three Councilman Kenneth Stokes said of Cindy Hyde-Smith’s involvement. “If the United States of American cares about the capital city of the state ... they will fund a new water plant, completely from A to Z.”

Earlier this month, Hyde-Smith introduced a bill to help Jackson “overcome long-neglected water infrastructure upgrades.” However, that proposal seemed to focus more on addressing emergency needs rather than building a new plant.

Jackson City Councilman Kenneth Stokes (WLBT)

Stokes introduced the measure about a month and a half after the city’s water system was crippled when severe winter storms ripped across the region.

The storms brought with them below-freezing temperatures, which caused equipment at the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant to freeze.

Water production fell, and tens of thousands of customers ended up with low or no water pressure.

The hardest-hit areas were in Fondren and south Jackson, which reported water outages for more than two weeks until production at Curtis could be increased and pressure could be restored.

Stokes said a new water plant built to serve South Jackson could help prevent similar water losses in the future.

“What we want to do is make sure that, without any doubt, this problem is fixed and fixed for good,” he said. “The first step in fixing this problem, if we get the money from the federal government, is a new plant.”

Stokes said it all depends on Hyde-Smith being “sincere in her efforts to help the city.”

He didn’t want to compare Hyde-Smith to her predecessor, the late Thad Cochran, but said that even though he didn’t agree with Cochran’s politics, the longtime senator always delivered.

“We need these senators to deliver for the capital city,” he said.

On March 16, Hyde-Smith announced that she had introduced a bill that would tap into several sources to provide funding to help Jackson make urgent repairs to its water infrastructure.

Hyde-Smith’s measure, known as the Emergency Water Infrastructure Improvements Act, would provide the city assistance through “a combination of loans, loan forgiveness, and grants.”

Among provisions, it would grant the city $47 million through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program and $25 million in unobligated Economic Adjustment Assistance grants from the U.S. Economic Development Administration.

“I cannot sit back and watch Jackson schools, businesses and residents go without water,” Hyde-Smith said. “My legislation would provide federal assistance to get Jackson on the path to providing the basic services its citizens require and deserve.”

The bill has been read twice and referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, according to Congress’ website.

Meanwhile, the president is proposing spending nearly $2 trillion over the eight years to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure and shift to green energy.

According to CNN, President Joe Biden’s plan would allocate $111 billion in investments in the nation’s aging water systems.

“The proposal would upgrade the country’s drinking water, wastewater and stormwater systems, tackle new contaminants and support clean water infrastructure in rural parts of the country,” CNN writes.

A second winter storm system is expected to bring additional snow, sleet and freezing rain to the state as it already struggles to deal with a first wave of below freezing conditions, according to the National Weather Service.

Much of the state remains under a winter weather warning ahead of another cold weather system that is expected to hit the state Wednesday afternoon and last into the night and into Thursday morning.

Some Central Mississippi counties could see up to an inch of additional ice accumulation with the approaching system. The Jackson metro area and counties in northeast Mississippi could see up to half an inch of ice and one to two inches of snow and sleet.

The additional ice, snow and sleet is expected to put additional strain on already-ice packed roadways and could lead to more power outages as ice-covered tree limbs and power lines collapse under the weight.

""We're not out of the woods yet,"" National Weather Service Meteorologist Alan Campbell said. ""We'll continue to have issues.""

Late Sunday night and into Monday, the first storm system crippled much of Mississippi and the South, shutting down vaccination clinics during a pandemic, resulting in road closures and hundreds of traffic accidents across the state and knocking out power to thousands of Mississippians amid brutally cold temperatures.

There remains over 16,000 reported power outages across the state, with most in the central to southern region of the state, according to PowerOutage.US. More than 55,000 customers were without power at the peak of the storm system.

The second system has also delayed the reopening of vaccination sites across the state with the exception of Forrest, Harrison, Jackson and Jones counties in southern Mississippi.

Tuesday, the United States Postal Service temporarily closed some Mississippi post offices because of the winter storm. Post offices in the affected areas will be closed for retail services, mail delivery and drop shipments, according to a Postal Service news release. ZIP codes impacted by the closures include those starting with 369, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 396 and 397.

Meanwhile, roadways covered in ice remain treacherous to motorists, first responders, and utility crews. The Mississippi Highway Patrol reported on Tuesday 695 weather-related incidents. Mississippi Department of Transportation spokesman Michael Flood said Tuesday afternoon snow plows and salt trucks continue to be deployed. But authorities on Wednesday continued to encourage Mississippians to stay off the roads.

In Jackson, the cold snap has caused widespread water pressure issues and officials fear it will lead to burst water pipes as the weather begins to gradually warm up towards the end of the week.

Campbell, the National Weather Service meteorologist, said while the second system will continue to be an issue, the weather will gradually warm up to temperatures above freezing this weekend and into next week.

""This will gradually begin to fall out,"" he said. ""It will still be cold. But the good news is we'll see highs above freezing going into the weekend.""

276,4-Mar-21,WLBT,Employees angry their business is struggling without water pressure while car wash operates next door,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - As the days without water linger in Jackson, many businesses are being hampered by the outages. But workers are growing irate at what they say is a waste of water by a local car wash while others are suffering.

“Right in front of the building, there’s a car wash that’s going full steam,” said Southern Research Group accounting manager Adam Sturdivant. He and the staff are upset that the five story Lefleur’s Bluff Tower has little water pressure and no air conditioning.

Fans were purchased for the call center which reaches 80 degrees. The air conditioning system requires water pressure to operate. Employees can only use a few bathrooms on the first floor. This has been going on for nearly two weeks.

“That car wash is up and running. Why are we having all these problems?” asked Sturdivant. “They’re shutting our air conditioners down because of a lack of water pressure and then 50 yards away there’s a car wash running full steam ahead.”

“We’re trying to conserve water and it really bothers me to see a car wash washing cars all day,” said Southern Research Group employee Evelyn Ford. The telephone interviewer said she contacted the governor’s office and was referred to the city.

After several days of calls, she was directed to the police department and 311.

“I was told that they would be given a citation,” said Ford. “We’re having to do our jobs and it’s unfair that a car wash will have cars, and I know on Wednesday, maybe on Tuesday it was 20 cars in line over there.”

I reached out to the management at Mister Car Wash about the company’s decision to operate.

“The city did not indicate the need to close while communicating with them,” said Mister Car Wash Corporate Communications Director Megan Everette.” After discussions the regional team has decided to close both stores early and monitor whether they should reopen Friday.

The corporate spokesperson said they are cooperating with the city’s efforts to restore water pressure.

“We love being a part of the community and our hearts are broken for the city and we are trying to be a part of the solution,” Everette added.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) ‚Äî Mississippi‚Äôs largest city is still struggling with water problems more than two weeks after winter storms and freezing weather ravaged the system in Jackson, knocking out water for drinking and making it impossible for many to even flush their toilets.

Residents in the city of 160,000 are still being warned to boil any water that does come out of the faucets.

‚ÄúI pray it comes back on,‚Äù Jackson resident Nita Smith said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how much more of this we can take.‚Äù

Smith has had no water at home for nearly three weeks.

Smith is concerned about her mother who has diabetes. Her mother and most of the other older people on her street don‚Äôt drive, so Smith has been helping them get water to clean themselves and flush their toilets.

A key focus of city crews is filling the system‚Äôs water tanks to an optimal level. But, public works director Charles Williams said Wednesday that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into a treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

‚ÄúToday was not a good day for us,‚Äù Williams said.

He said about a fourth of Jackson‚Äôs customers remained without running water. That is more than 10,000 connections, with most serving multiple people.

City officials on Wednesday continued distributing water for flushing toilets at several pick-up points. But they‚Äôre giving no specific timeline for resolving problems. Workers continue to fix dozens of water main breaks and leaks.

The crisis has taken a toll on businesses. Jeff Good is co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, and two of them remained closed Wednesday. In a Facebook update, Good said the businesses have insurance, but he‚Äôs concerned about his employees.

‚ÄúWe will not be financially ruined,‚Äù Good wrote. ‚ÄúThe spirits of our team members are my biggest concern. A true malaise and depression is setting in.‚Äù

Mississippi‚Äôs capital city is not alone in water problems. More than two weeks have passed since the cold wave shut down the main power grid in Texas, leaving millions in freezing homes, causing about 50 deaths and disabling thousands of public water systems serving those millions.

Four public water systems in Texas remained out of commission Wednesday, affecting 456 customers, and 225 systems still have 135,299 customers boiling their tap water, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Also, 208 of the state‚Äôs 254 counties are still reporting public water system issues.

Bonnie Bishop, 68, and her husband, Mike, 63, have been without water at their Jackson home for 14 days. Both have health problems.

She‚Äôs recovering after months in the hospital with the coronavirus. She‚Äôs home but still in therapy to learn how to walk again and deals with neuropathy in her hands and feet.

She has not been able to soak her feet in warm water, something that usually provides relief for the neuropathy, or to help her husband gather water to boil for cooking for cleaning.

Mike Bishop just had elbow surgery. The first week the couple was without water, he still had staples in his arm and was hauling 5-gallon containers from his truck, his wife said. Bonnie Bishop said she told him not to strain himself, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen. They feel they have no choice.

On Monday, the couple drove 25 miles (40 kilometers) to Mike‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house to do laundry.

Jackson‚Äôs water system has not been able to provide a sustainable flow of water throughout the city since the mid-February storms, city officials say.

The system ‚Äúbasically crashed like a computer and now we‚Äôre trying to rebuild it,‚Äù Williams said at a recent briefing.

The city‚Äôs water mains are more than a century old, and its infrastructure needs went unaddressed for decades, Democratic Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has said.

‚ÄúWe more than likely have more than a $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,‚Äù he said.

Jackson voters in 2014 approved a 1-cent local sales tax to pay for improvements to roads and water and sewer systems. On Tuesday, the city council voted to seek legislative approval for another election to double that local tax to 2 cents a dollar.

Republican Gov. Tate Reeves would have to agree to letting Jackson have the tax election.

‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money,‚Äù Reeves said Tuesday.

Jackson has had problems for years with its water billing system and with the quality of water.

Melanie Deaver Hanlin, who was without water for 14 days, has been flushing toilets with pool water and showering at friends‚Äô homes. She said Jackson‚Äôs water system ‚Äúneeds to be fixed, not patched.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the issue now ‚Äî poor maintenance for far too long,‚Äù Hanlin said. ‚ÄúAnd Jackson residents are paying the price.‚Äù

Many residents of Jackson, Miss., remain without running water three weeks after a winter storm hit the city.

The water outages in Jackson began Feb. 15 as a winter storm swept across the state. The storm brought devastating, bitter cold to the South and hit the region's critical infrastructure hard--highlighting major vulnerabilities in the area's power grid and water system.

Some water treatment plants in the city couldn't operate in the freezing temperatures that lingered for days. Because plants were shut down for so long, water pressure in the city dropped.

As of March 3, service had been restored in some areas, but a boil water notice remained in effect for many residents, according to city officials.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said March 1 in a Twitter post that the city has ""made some strides"" restoring water service, but more work needs to be done.

But the timeline of when full water service could be restored is unclear.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the plants are back online, but the water pressure needs to be at a consistent rate for it to reach the homes farthest from the treatment plants.

In the meantime, city officials and the National Guard are distributing non-potable water to people. That water can be used to flush toilets, but can be used for little else.

In the meantime, residents such as Wayne Johnson are traveling through the city filling milk jugs and other containers with water. Johnson told NPR his elderly neighbor has been without water since Feb. 16.

He said, ""She's elderly, she can't handle jugs of water so I'm catching water. Got coolers and jugs and everything else. I'm filling bathtubs up with water and everything else to flush and do what we can.""

Lumumba said the water system's failure has only served to highlight issues that have existed for decades. He said the city needs state and federal funding to help replace 100-year-old pipes.

He said, ""They have been described as peanut brittle when our crews jump into holes in order to repair them. Sometimes they'll repair one break, stay for a little while, and see another break happen mere yards away from the one that they just repaired.""","Like 'Peanut Brittle': Mississippi Water Crisis Highlights Infrastructure ProblemsEnlarge this image toggle caption Rogelio V.

JACKSON, Miss. ‚Äì A water outage in Jackson, Mississippi, has caused many to lug gallons from distribution sites to their homes just to flush the toilet. Low pressure in faucets has made it difficult to shower or wash dishes. A citywide water boil notice has left thousands of people without immediate, safe drinking water.

Officials in the city of roughly 160,000 people said the water pressure was being restored after it was depleted by a winter storm that passed through the area three weeks ago. In some pockets of the city, largely among higher elevations, residents were still experiencing little to no water pressure as of Monday.

The water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a boil notice issued Feb. 16.

Testing revealed the water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance it may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city Thursday once water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

How did this happen? Here's what to know about the water crisis in Jackson:

Feb. 16 : Weather chokes city facilities

Winter weather and icy temperatures choked equipment at water treatment plants, rendering water pressure inadequate.

Nearly 43,000 water customers were placed under a boil-water advisory.

Feb. 18 : No set timeline for restoration

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba announced the capital city did not have a definitive timeline for total water restoration.

Williams noted water main breaks popping up that further complicated the process of getting water to residents.

Water distribution sites began to lace the city, and fire stations made available nonpotable water for residents.

Feb. 22 : 300,000 in Mississippi under boil water advisories

The state Health Department recorded 300,000 customers under boil water advisories across Mississippi.

Convenience and grocery stores saw a surge in demand for bottled water as many residents did not have safe water. Supplies began to run low.

City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said Jackson provided more than 26,500 bottles of water and about 7,000 gallons of nonpotable water.

Feb. 23 : Governor activates Guard

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system. Reeves tweeted he'd secured tankers to provide nonpotable water. He activated the Mississippi National Guard to assist during the crisis.

Feb. 24 : Officials warn of water main breaks

Officials said most of the city would see water restored by the end of the week, but they warned residents water main breaks could cause delays.

Ten water distribution sites popped up.

Feb. 25 : Water pressure gradually increasing

Williams said at a news conference water pressure was increasing gradually at the water treatment plants, which allowed them to pump out more water.

Mayor Lumumba and Williams point to Feb. 26 as a more likely date water would be restored.

March 1 : Pressure falls back; south Jackson struggles

Williams said the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. South Jackson residents struggled with a lack of water and water pressure.

Up to 80 water main breaks were reported since the storm hit. Workers mended the breaks, while volunteers, community members and officials manned water distribution sites.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes.

March 2 : No city data on water outages

Officials said they did not know the number of residents without water or the date for full restoration.

Williamssaid south Jackson residents in high-elevation areas were dealing with outages, but he did not know how many residents were without water.

March 3 : Aging infrastructure at fault, official says

Water intake filters full of clams, mussels, fish and other items forced systems offline to clean the filters, Williams said. Some customers who had seen water pressure return may have lost it again, he said.

Williams confirmed more than 10,000 water customers did not have any water. Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, he said.

Previously: Weeks after Mississippi winter storms, some residents still don't have water

March 4 : An email to the governor

Media outlets get hold of an email Lumumba sent to Reeves on March 3. Lumumba requested about $47 million in emergency funding from the state and federal government to cover a wide range of projects relating to water system infrastructure.

Seeking answers from the city: Mississippi's capital city hasn't had clean water in weeks. Is there an end in sight?

State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs said the Department of Health continued to monitor the quality of Jackson's water supply and was working with the city.

March 8: Low pressure, boil water advisory remained

Several residents, businesses and schools continue to deal with low water pressure.

Jackson remains under a water boil advisory because of high turbidity ‚Äì cloudiness that increases the possibility water might contain disease-causing organisms.

JACKSON, Miss. ‚Äì Two weeks into a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, after a series of winter storms, city officials say they do not know how many residents are still without water or when water will be restored.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Tuesday that there are still pockets of homes in south Jackson's high-elevation areas without water, but he could not share a total number of outages.

He said water pressure at the city's treatment plant was gradually being restored, but a firm date for restoration of the system remains elusive.

For more than two weeks, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.

Williams had said he was hopeful the system would be up to speed by Feb. 26, the weekend after the city first reported a water shortage on Feb. 17.

Instead, he said the prolonged freezing temperatures from winter storm systems crippled a system unequipped to deal with the temperature drop.

More than 100 water breaks reported

The system is still not putting out enough water pressure to service its more than 43,000 customers. That has been complicated by water main breaks across the city that have leaked water into city streets and yards. Since the city first reported a water shortage, more than 100 water breaks have been reported. As of Monday night, crews had completed 53 repairs, he said.

Williams said Tuesday that it's possible a large water main break that has not been reported is also siphoning water from the city's water supply.

""A hard number is difficult to track,"" Williams said. ""We would have to go door-to-door to know precisely where all the outages are.""

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has also been been hesitant to give a firm date for recovery of the water system.

The city has been tracking outages through reports from residents and its 311 hotline. The mayor's spokeswoman, Michelle Atoa said that as of Tuesday afternoon the hotline had received more than 1,500 water outage calls since Feb. 15, but she was unable to provide a hard number of residence outages or an estimate.

6,3/24/2021 0:00,‚ÄòA profound betrayal of trust‚Äô: Why Jackson‚Äôs water system is broken,"Janna Avalon, a 72-year-old retired newspaper editor, lived out the mid-February ice storm and weeks-long water outage just feet from South Jackson‚Äôs empty water tower.

The one million-gallon tank, one of several across the city, is meant to store water at a high elevation, utilizing gravity to pressurize the delivery system, especially during service interruptions.

But contingency plans are a myth in a system as chronically broken as Jackson‚Äôs.

So for the better part of the last month, Avalon and her husband Billy heaved buckets of water they retrieved from government tankers, kind neighbors or rainfall into their home to flush their toilet or wash dishes.

Most Jacksonians lost running water altogether after back-to-back winter storms the week of Feb. 14 stunned unprepared utilities across the Deep South, and the Avalons were some of the roughly 43,000 people whose taps remained dry for more than two weeks. City officials were still telling most residents, 82% of whom are Black, to boil their water a month later.

‚ÄúWater is the most intimate relationship you have with the government ‚Ä¶ when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered, it‚Äôs a profound betrayal of trust.‚Äù Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison‚Äôs La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

In the Avalons‚Äô spacious backyard ‚Äî beyond a wooden playset, garden and plum trees, plastic flamingos and decorative stone statues ‚Äî the water tower adds its own charm. Avalon said it reflects colors in the evening sky, prolonging sunsets.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got all these great little attributes,‚Äù Avalon said, ‚Äúexcept water.‚Äù

Avalon grew up in Jackson and has lived in her home, where she raised her five children, for 28 years. Despite ongoing utility hiccups, she‚Äôs intent on staying. She asks why she should have to move ‚Äî and contribute to the city‚Äôs population decline of 20% since 1980 ‚Äî to access basic human services. Why city and state government officials can‚Äôt or won‚Äôt improve conditions where she already lives. Why her water bills are unreliable, why nobody reads her water meter, and why there is a ‚Äúhuge city water tower in our backyard and there‚Äôs no water in it.‚Äù

The questions seem simple, but the answers are complex, and the dysfunction is causing a rift between Jacksonians and their leaders.

‚ÄúWater is the most intimate relationship you have with the government,‚Äù said Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison‚Äôs La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. ‚ÄúIt comes into your house. You take it into your body. We put our children in it, and we prepare food with it. And when that fails ‚Äî when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered ‚Äî it‚Äôs a profound betrayal of trust. And it shakes you to your core.‚Äù

Many Jacksonians lacked access to clean drinking water long before the most recent storm. In fact, on a good day, officials advise pregnant people and children under five not to drink from the tap, a phenomenon that‚Äôs been the case for the last five years.

‚ÄúAnd most people in Jackson don‚Äôt even know,‚Äù Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, told Mississippi Today during the recent outage. ‚ÄúThe city and the state have done nothing to provide water to those populations. This whole time they should have been providing water for pregnant people and children under five. This whole time.‚Äù

And yet, when Jackson water customers do receive a bill (because consistent and accurate billing has also been a problem), they‚Äôre sometimes paying exorbitant amounts for water that‚Äôs unsafe to drink.

Every city water bill notifies customers of the hazard of high lead levels first found in Jackson‚Äôs tap water in 2016, caused by recurring faulty water treatment techniques that remain unaddressed.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city‚Äôs water system presented ‚Äúimminent and substantial endangerment‚Äù to its customers and could contain E. Coli.

Water outages and the presence of harmful contaminants when the water does reach the tap are two different scenarios with unique sets of threats, but they both stem from decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance within a dysfunctional and outdated water treatment and delivery system.

And the risks of scarce or dirty water exist more often in the homes of families who are already burdened by the ongoing pandemic, low wages, stagnant wealth, a lack of quality health care and racism.

The city is faced with two colliding but distinct funding problems: One, the city‚Äôs infrastructure is only getting older and past administrations did not plan for inevitable future capital investments, as is true in many aging cities. Two, the loss of customer base and pervasive billing troubles have left the water department without a feasible revenue model for regular operations and maintenance.

‚ÄúThis is like a triple or quadruple whammy, what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at D.C.-based Center for Community Progress. ‚ÄúOne layer is the fact that older cities ‚Äî completely leaving aside race, poverty, all that ‚Äî are at a disadvantage to young cities.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen you get the second layer,‚Äù Mallach continued. ‚ÄúYou have this whole phenomenon which has been going on really since the 1950s, where older cities, central cities, have essentially been abandoned by large parts of the middle class, especially the white middle class, for the suburbs.‚Äù

Winter storms in past years ‚Äî 1989, 1994, 2010, 2014 and most recently 2018 ‚Äî have tested the city‚Äôs outdated water delivery system and caused widespread water main breaks and outages. Each time, the city has scrambled to make band-aid repairs, only to wait until the next catastrophe. Jackson isn‚Äôt alone in taking this approach, said Teodoro, the Wisconsin professor.

‚ÄúThe nature of local politics is that city governments will tend to neglect utilities until they break because they‚Äôre literally buried,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOne of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe. But the price is very easy for them to observe.‚Äù

Not even EPA orders ‚Äî including a decade-old consent decree over the city‚Äôs wastewater system that continues to release raw sewage into the Pearl River ‚Äî have resulted in much meaningful action. City water and sewer systems are not like corporations, Teodoro said; the authorities can‚Äôt just take their license away. And imposing large fines only punishes the taxpayers they are supposed to be protecting. ‚ÄúIn the end, there‚Äôs very little you can do,‚Äù Teodoro said of regulators.

‚ÄúThey just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That‚Äôs what it feels like.‚Äù Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund

This year, Jackson officials said, issues were particularly pronounced at the water treatment plants, which are not enclosed and protected from the elements like plants typically are up north.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams told the media that the screens through which water from the reservoir is filtered had frozen, rendering the plant incapable of taking in water, causing pressure to drop across the system. Operators didn‚Äôt discover the issue until the weekend after the storms. They also encountered malfunctioning raw water pumps.

Also, the 10 million gallon basins where filtered reservoir water is stored before it is chemically treated contained two feet of sludge due to an overdose in chemicals that occured over time when water wasn‚Äôt coming in ‚Äî a possible human error, Williams said. The city took two basins offline to clean them the week after the storm and cleaned the third a couple weeks later.

In addition to needed equipment upgrades, the city is sorely lacking the personnel needed to operate the plant in its current condition. City officials rely on these operators to notify them of an event, such as sludge build up, that they need to address. Jackson employs three high-level operators at each of its water treatment plants, when each facility really needs six of these top officials, Williams told Mississippi Today. In 2018, there were 60 unfilled positions in Public Works, Clarion Ledger reported.

‚ÄúYou have to maintain what you have until you‚Äôre able to make improvements,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúBut once again, you have to have funding.‚Äù

Two generations of white and wealth flight out of Jackson has reduced the built-in revenue that officials say the water system needs just to maintain full operations, including hiring personnel ‚Äî let alone to make a dent in an estimated $1 billion worth of needed upgrades.

The city‚Äôs bungled attempt to revamp its water meter and billing system through a $90 million contract with German-based manufacturer Siemens only worsened the water department‚Äôs cash flow ‚Äî not to mention public confidence ‚Äî while any outside investment in the capital city has come at a crawl.

‚ÄúAnd we all know why,‚Äù Roberts, the activist, said. ‚ÄúNobody wants to invest in Jackson because of who runs Jackson and who lives in Jackson. Because white folks don‚Äôt dominate here anymore. They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That‚Äôs what it feels like.‚Äù

With a population that‚Äôs 82% African American, Jackson is the single Blackest large city in the nation. Roughly 1-in-4 residents live in poverty, and in some west and south Jackson communities, the hardest hit by water outages, the average household pulls an income of $25,000 and as low as $15,000 in some pockets.

The capital city has lost roughly 40,000 residents since the population peaked at about 200,000 in 1980, after an initial wave of white residents left to avoid putting their children in integrated schools. Half of the decline occurred in the last two decades as more middle-class Black families moved, and the city‚Äôs white population continued to drop from 52% in 1980 to 28% in 2000 to 17% in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

As the customer base declines, the system might clean and pump out less water, but the same infrastructure remains under the surface of Jackson‚Äôs 111 square miles, an area geographically larger than Seattle, Baltimore or Cincinnati. Parts of Jackson‚Äôs 1,500 miles of water mains are over 100 years old.

Of course, pipes under streets in front of abandoned properties ‚Äî about 4,000 by one 2019 count ‚Äî still require maintenance.

At the same time, family resources are diminishing with inflation. Household buying power fell just slightly in the 1980s and was relatively stable through the 1990s. But since 2000, the annual median household income in Jackson has dropped about $6,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars, a roughly 15% decrease, according to a Mississippi Today analysis of Census data.

‚ÄúWe are a city with very high levels of poverty, and it‚Äôs difficult for us to raise the rates enough to do large scale replacement type projects and not make it unaffordable to live in the city of Jackson,‚Äù said former city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

Yet the cost of Jackson‚Äôs poor quality water is still passed on to families who don‚Äôt trust the tap and purchase bottled water ‚Äî which can cost a family of four $50-$100 a month ‚Äî to drink instead.

‚ÄúThese would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn‚Äôt for racism.‚Äù Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison‚Äôs La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

The city raised water rates in 2013, but the Siemens deal penned the same year came with an onslaught of problems, including the installation of faulty water meters and meters that measured water in gallons instead of the correct cubic feet. This made any benefits of the rate increase virtually impossible to see.

The results have been nonsensical. Over the past several years, the city has mailed exorbitant bills to some customers and none to others. Sometimes, the charges weren‚Äôt based on how much water a household used and other times, city officials advised residents to ‚Äúpay what they think they owe.‚Äù Past officials said the city lacked the manpower and expertise in the billing department to manually rectify the account issues with any speed.

In trying to protect people during the persistent billing blunders, the city has at times instituted no-shutoff policies, which demonstrate compassion but haven‚Äôt helped to compel payment.

Today, more than 8,000 customers, or nearly one-sixth of the city‚Äôs customer base, still aren‚Äôt receiving bills. Nearly 16,000 customers owe more than $100 or are more than 90 days past due, a city spokesperson told Mississippi Today. Jackson water customers owe a total of $90.3 million.

As a result, the city continues to miss out on tens of millions of water revenues. In 2016, when officials first uncovered the issue, the city‚Äôs actual water sewer collections during the previous year was a startling 32% less than projected ‚Äî a roughly $26 million shortfall.

It‚Äôs a vicious cycle: revenue shortfalls make it harder for the city to purchase upgrades or hire the personnel needed to properly manage the billing system; the billing inaccuracies and sloppy accounting encourage a culture of nonpayment; the unpaid bills just further tank the revenue.

Frustration only grows as residents are expected to pay for subpar service within a utility that‚Äôs already largely taken for granted.

The city received just under $60 million out of last year‚Äôs $90 million Siemens settlement, about $33 million of which is restricted in reserves or bond covenants. Another $12.6 million went to repay the general fund, leaving about $14 million for emergency sewer repairs and a new billing system.

Lawyers got the rest ‚Äî a little more than $30 million.

The story of Jackson‚Äôs failing infrastructure, national experts say, could just as easily describe the scenario in other major cities like Detroit, Toledo or Kansas City, whose leaders have had to look outside their own budgets to solve major crises.

A city rests within a state, after all, and decisions made at the state level and the impact those decisions have on the economy and public services affect what a city is able to accomplish.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really disingenuous to look at the politics and policies of any one American city in isolation from the state context in which it exists,‚Äù Teodoro said.

The residents who left Jackson in the late 20th century fled to surrounding suburbs such as Rankin County, the wealthier Republican bastion that produced many of Mississippi‚Äôs most powerful politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves.

Less than a year ago, Reeves vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided relief to poor Jacksonians with past due water bills and propped up the city‚Äôs bond rating, a proposal he suggested perpetuated a ‚Äú‚Äòfree money‚Äô concept,‚Äù Clarion Ledger reported.

A similar bill, which would apply to all municipalities, is making its way through the Legislature this session. Lawmakers also killed a bill to assist Jackson with infrastructure bonds, but it still has a chance to pass legislation that would allow the city to propose its own sales tax increase to pay for water system improvements.

Meanwhile, Speaker Philip Gunn, another top lawmaker who lives in a Jackson suburb, spent the session trying to pass tax reform that would have actually increased the tax burden on the bottom 60% of the state‚Äôs income earners, according to one study, while significantly cutting the taxes of the richest residents.

The city is also still fighting the state‚Äôs 2016 attempt to wrest control of Jackson‚Äôs airport. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during a recent mayoral debate that during a conversation with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the state Senate leader who lives in the white pocket of northeast Jackson, the lieutenant governor asked the mayor to ‚Äúgive me my airport‚Äù in exchange for infrastructure funding.

This ongoing tension is the backdrop for the city‚Äôs current crisis.

Academics who have studied government water systems recommend they regionalize in order to spread costs among struggling cities and more affluent suburbs. There‚Äôs just one recurring hitch to securing such an agreement: ‚ÄúRacism makes all of this so much harder,‚Äù Teodoro said.

‚ÄúThese would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn‚Äôt for racism.‚Äù

The history of racial conflict, Teodoro explained, creates a scenario where Black residents of the city fear losing control of their services to the same people who have systematically oppressed them. And white residents of the suburbs, who chalk the city‚Äôs problems up to incompetence, don‚Äôt feel responsible to help.

In the Jackson metro, not only is regionalization a tough sell, there are examples of the opposite happening. West Rankin Utility Authority recently splintered off to build its own wastewater treatment facility to become independent from Jackson‚Äôs Savannah Street Wastewater Treatment Plant.

It‚Äôs twofold: Systemic racism is an unmistakable underlying cause for Jackson‚Äôs stripped resources, and while it may be clouded by a mutual distrust today, racism continues to prevent future investment.

For Avalon, a white woman, understanding the decline of her majority-Black community is as easy as pointing to the state‚Äôs refusal to fully fund education or expand Medicaid.

‚ÄúRacism is everywhere,‚Äù Avalon said. ‚ÄúWe need to recognize what we‚Äôre talking about. If my kid goes to public school that‚Äôs not up to par, why? We‚Äôre all paying taxes.‚Äù

The storage tank on Avalon‚Äôs street wasn‚Äôt full of water, Williams explained, because as the system loses pressure on an ongoing basis, not just during storms, the tower is constantly drained to make up for the deficiencies. He said he didn‚Äôt know if that tank had ever been full.

South Jackson often bears the brunt of water crises because the area is one of the furthest away from the treatment plant, so water takes longer to travel there. What little water would have been inside the tower at the time of the storm was used up immediately by some of the roughly 70,000 people who live in South Jackson.

That‚Äôs a convenient explanation for Avalon, who says her community is always last to receive attention on a variety of issues. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been putting up with that stuff all my life in south Jackson,‚Äù she said.

Jackson City Councilman De‚ÄôKeither Stamps pushed the council to ask the state for $60 million, in addition to an initial $47 million proposal, to build new water storage towers in South Jackson and Byram to build up capacity in those areas.

‚ÄúYou shouldn‚Äôt have to live your life in fear of the plant going down,‚Äù Stamps said. ‚ÄúYou should have enough capacity within a short distance from your house to maintain yourself.‚Äù

On March 1, just as water was starting to trickle out of her tap, Avalon stood on her back porch as it rained and looked out at the empty water reservoir that engulfs the skyline. City contractors had just come out a few years ago to repaint its dingy exterior, she recalled. Some 100 feet up, a large black fowl crouched on top of the massive steel structure stamped with the City of Jackson seal.

‚ÄúIf they‚Äôre vultures, gosh, that‚Äôs a terrible omen,‚Äù she said with a chuckle.

Water pressure in the Avalon home fell again in the following days as city officials discovered the facility‚Äôs intake filters were clogged with clams, mussels, tree branches and other items and had to take the systems offline. The Avalons had to shut off their water again the following weekend because of a broken pipe on their property. They‚Äôll expect outages to continue.

‚ÄúIt keeps coming back and slapping us in the face, and we can‚Äôt do anything about it,‚Äù Avalon said.

7,2021-03-03 02:46:00+00:00,"Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis brings to light long-standing problems in city","After more than two weeks without clean running water, Katasha Johnson saw a slow trickle dribbling down a faucet in her home on the west side of Jackson, Mississippi, on Tuesday.

But the brown drip didn't feel like a reprieve for Johnson, 38, who lost water after back-to-back winter storms slammed the city and its century-old water infrastructure last month.

""It's not enough to do anything with, and it doesn't even look safe,"" said Johnson, the mother of children ages 9, 6 and 3.

Instead, Johnson and her fianc√© are using melted snow and collected rainwater stored in four large coolers to flush the toilet. To clean dishes and hands, Johnson boils pots of water taken from a bathtub that was pre-filled when water was available.

""It has been absolutely horrible to live like this,"" she said.

Jackson has entered the third week of a crisis that has left much of the city without water since freezing temperatures devastated much of the South. Community leaders say that the disaster isn't a one-off and that it has brought to light long-simmering issues of systemic breakdown and neglect.

Weeks after the storm, the city continues to be under a boil water notice, and residents are being urged to conserve water and lower consumption as much as possible. Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city. Many say they have been turned away after supplies ran out.

Jackson reported 96 main water breaks and leaks, 53 of which have been repaired, the mayor's office said a statement.

""Today we saw pressure stay around 83 to 85 psi. This is good, but ultimately, we need to get to 90 psi and stay there consistently in order for water to be restored to everyone. This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the statement said.

More than half of the city's schools are closed because of the water crisis; only 19 of nearly 50 public schools have reopened.

While it's still unclear how many residents are out of water, community leaders, like state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, say it's at least 40,000.

Staff members and volunteers with the MS Black Women's Roundtable recently joined with other community partners in providing critical resources like water, hot meals and other necessities at Wingfield High School as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Crudup has had no water for 16 days. He lives with his wife and two grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, in the hardest-hit part of the city, in South Jackson.

""We can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry. It's tremendously difficult,"" he said.

Crudup said that the city's infrastructure was already frail and that the crisis has highlighted how easily it can break.

""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,"" he said. ""This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women‚Äôs Roundtable and co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative, a local nonprofit organization, said the water crisis has highlighted a slew of underlying issues long afflicting the community.

""This was a breakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens,"" she said. ""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people.""

Church as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Jackson's population is more than 80 percent Black.

Welchlin said the government hasn't invested in Jackson's infrastructure for a very long time.

""All of this is interconnected. Because of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see,"" she said.

Welchlin and Crudup said state and federal intervention is necessary to fully address not just infrastructure but all of the underlying issues connected to the crisis.

In the interim, several groups have stepped up to aid community members. The Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and other local organizations have coordinated supplies, water and services for residents in need. They have donated gift cards for food and bills and arranged for water trucks, and they have been dropping off cases of bottled water.

But many residents have also had to dip into their own pockets. Kehinde Gaynor, 42, has had to rent three hotel rooms in the last two weeks to give his wife and three children a place with safe water to bathe and wash.

Many residents have had to do that, he said, and the expenses have added up very quickly.

""Not having water isn't new to us. We've lost it before, but never as long as this,"" he said. ""It's affecting every part of our life, and to me it feels like we're the next Flint, Michigan.""","Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city.

8,2021-03-13 09:30:00+00:00,"A month without water: In Jackson, Mississippi, struggling residents fear next outage","JACKSON, Miss. ‚Äî The power was out, the temperature was in the low 20s and the roads bordered on impassable when Vince Gordon lost water at his south Jackson home in mid-February.

His family hunkered down with a generator, and the reserve of water they‚Äôd bought in preparation for the winter storm. By the end of the week, the ice had thawed. But when they checked the faucet, nothing came out.

For much of the city, it stayed that way for three weeks. And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city‚Äôs water service had been restored, the crisis isn‚Äôt over.

At the Global Connection Learning Center, a day care serving 59 children, there‚Äôs still tape over the sinks to make sure children don‚Äôt use them, as much of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice. Staff members wash the toddlers‚Äô hands and the center's dishes with bottled water instead. Nancy Sylvester, the center‚Äôs director, takes bibs and cot covers to her home in nearby Clinton to launder them.

At the height of the crisis, at least 40,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring Byram were estimated to have lost water service. While locals are no longer melting snow or collecting rainwater in buckets to have the ability to flush toilets, officials have not yet been able to prove that most of the city‚Äôs water is safe to drink. For many residents, frequenting water giveaways has become a part of their daily routine.

Life these days is about ‚Äújust getting water and trying to make it work,‚Äù said south Jackson resident Alonzo Mabry, who has been scouring the city for free bottled water for his 94-year-old mother, who is bedridden.

Officials hope to begin lifting the boil-water notice by next week, but challenges remain. Absent an overhaul of what Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba has called ‚Äúpeanut brittle‚Äù-like infrastructure, and the hundreds of millions of dollars to make it happen, the threat of the next outage looms.

Although previous cold snaps have caused water main breaks, locals say this year‚Äôs outage is one of the worst in recent history. Danyelle Holmes, a field director with the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign and a Jackson resident, spent much of the past month helping distribute water in the city. She‚Äôd seen commercials by international charities showing families and young children filling up buckets and jugs with water. Now this was happening at home.

Holmes is not surprised that the infrastructure in a city where some of the pipes predate the Great Depression ‚Äúwent sour.‚Äù

Water shoots out of a broken 6-inch water main in Jackson, Miss., on Feb. 26. Barbara Gauntt / Clarion Ledger via USA Today Network

Jackson is a city with an estimated $2 billion infrastructure problem ‚Äî the cost of overdue water and sewer overhauls ‚Äî and a $300 million annual budget. Twenty-five percent of residents in Jackson live below the poverty line. The city‚Äôs median income is just below $39,000. Although it‚Äôs Mississippi‚Äôs largest city, Jackson, where 82 percent of residents are Black, has struggled. Decades of white flight have whittled down the city‚Äôs economic footing.

‚ÄúAll of this happened to individuals at no fault of their own and yet they have to suffer,‚Äù she said.

For years, the city has struggled to collect overdue water bills from residents, while locals have reported receiving astronomical bills of $1,000 or more. In 2014, voters approved an additional 1 percent sales tax to make improvements. That‚Äôs brought the city $13 million to $15 million a year for improvements, but it still falls short.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday that his top priority is making sure residents have safe running water again. But he‚Äôs also spent time lobbying for funding from the state that could help prevent future crises.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not done yet,‚Äù he said.

The city‚Äôs latest chapter in a long history of infrastructure woes started Feb. 15, when a winter storm pummeled Mississippi and much of the South.

In Jackson, critical machinery froze at the city‚Äôs water plant. A precipitous drop in water pressure followed, further taxing the city‚Äôs water supply as residents kept their faucets dripping in an attempt to prevent pipes from freezing. The gradual return of pressure as temperatures warmed up proved too much for Jackson‚Äôs system to handle. Nearly 100 confirmed water breaks in the city followed, creating another setback in efforts to restore water supply.

A coalition of grassroots groups formed a rapid response team to supply water to residents. Organizers also provided cash assistance to locals who had missed work because of the storm or struggled to replace groceries that spoiled when the electricity went out.

Natt Offiah, a volunteer for the effort, monitored the group‚Äôs hotline. One woman who called over several days for help was incredulous when she learned the group wasn‚Äôt part of a government-led response. Pipes had burst in her home and she was desperate for assistance to stay in a hotel. As the group worked to collect donations to put her up, she told Offiah she‚Äôd never heard of a state or federal agency using methods like Cash App to deliver relief funds. She asked if they were a scam.

‚ÄúI thought this was the government. Do you know if the state is doing anything?‚Äù she asked Offiah.

Almost a week would pass before the National Guard arrived to distribute water.

‚ÄúRight now, we all we got,‚Äù Offiah told her, recalling that ‚Äúher mood changed from anger to frustration to a bit of shock. The disappointment was pointed toward the lack of state response.‚Äù

Bailey Martin, a spokeswoman for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves‚Äô office, said the governor had fulfilled several requests made by Hinds County, where Jackson is located, including for water delivery. Reeves, a Republican, signed an executive order on Feb. 23 to deploy the National Guard once local officials made the request, Martin said. Members arrived with four tanker trucks the next day.

She added that Reeves ""couldn't be more proud"" of the work the National Guard and the state's emergency management agency have done over the past 13 months.

Before the recent storm, many residents say a deep freeze in 2018 was a warning shot. Frigid temperatures caused a streak of water main breaks, leaving some locals without water for the week. The event also shut down the city‚Äôs schools for several days. Many of the district‚Äôs campuses lacked enough water pressure to flush toilets or heat up buildings.

That same month, the city council signaled their support for potential litigation against a private company charged with upgrading the city's water billing system, resulting in an eventual settlement in 2020. Jackson received about $60 million in funds, but steep expenses remain. The past few weeks have further exposed the fragility of the city‚Äôs water system.

As crews worked to restore service, Lumumba and the city‚Äôs legislative delegation began lobbying top officials in the state for a reprieve. Lumumba drafted a letter to the state‚Äôs Republican leadership and the congressional delegation, requesting $47 million in aid.

Another option, introduced by state Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, would allow the city to bring another tax increase before voters for repairs. But the legislation must pass both chambers and cross Reeves' desk before becoming law. As the April 4 end date of the legislative session approaches, it‚Äôs unclear if lawmakers will take action.

The city has submitted a damage assessment of $16 million in hopes of securing federal relief. Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor‚Äôs office, said officials anticipate sending a supplemental request as further costs are determined.

Williams expressed hope Thursday that funds from the latest Covid-19 relief package recently signed by President Joe Biden would trickle down to Jackson and provide a start.

In the meantime, some residents, like Holmes, aren‚Äôt waiting for a solution to be sketched out. Climate change that has pushed hotter summers and harsher winters in the region, she said, means the city‚Äôs system will be hit again. She‚Äôs already discussing with organizers how to prepare for the next one.

‚ÄúWe can never say, ‚Äòwe won‚Äôt see this day again,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe know the next time we experience this, it will be worse.‚Äù","And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city‚Äôs water service had been restored, the crisis isn‚Äôt over.

An electrical fire at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant caused two service pumps to fail, resulting in a loss of water pressure for Jackson residents for several hours Friday morning.

The cause of the electrical fire, which was contained to a control panel in the operations room of the plant, is now under investigation, Assistant Fire Chief Patrick Armon said.

No one was injured in the fire.

Ward 6 Councilman Aaron Banks, who oversees south Jackson, said he was overwhelmed with calls from concerned residents over the water shortage. The city's monthlong water shortage that began about February 16 is still fresh on their minds, he said.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said at 1 p.m. Friday the plant was delivering about 70 pounds per square inch of pressure, which is below the 90 psi that is required for full water pressure. The danger zone is below 65 psi which is where the city was at Friday morning, causing residents to go without a shower and leaving a trickle of water from their faucets.

Ward 4 Councilman De'Keither Stamps said the resulting water shortage is another reason why the city needs a backup system.

""We can't make it a couple of hours without the plant pressurizing the system,"" Stamps said. ""This is a resiliency issue that we need to tackle. We need some kind of backup for when something like this happens again.""

Friday's electrical fire comes after the plant lost power about two weeks ago, Williams said. The city is considering purchasing backup generators for both water treatment plants at a cost of $3 to $5 million if it receives water infrastructure funding it has requested. The generators would allow the pumps to function in the case of another power outage, although Williams said a generator would not have helped in Friday's fire.

The Jackson and Ridgeland fire departments responded to the call at about 3:30 a.m., Armon said. He said there was little to no structural damage from the fire. He noted electrical fires are usually caused by several factors, including old equipment, wear and tear, and an overload on the circuits.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba alluded to the outdated infrastructure and equipment at the plant at a press conference at City Hall, but said it was too early to make a connection to Friday's fire.

""I won't indicate that today's fire is based on its age, but I will say we've experienced a number of challenges at our water facilities,"" Lumumba said. ""We know that we have a number of areas that need to be repaired or upgraded, and so, we've seen this has become something we frequent far too often.""

The mayor said he is keeping the city under a state of emergency related to its water infrastructure because it is possible there will be additional issues at the plant until the city is able to fund repairs and upkeep.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil water notice. Williams said the water tanks at the plant need to be replenished before water samples can be taken. That could happen as early as Friday evening, he said.

Sulton was one of many south Jackson residents who would be without water for the better part of February, when a winter storm battered the state for days.

On the night of Feb. 11, temperatures in Jackson plummeted to freezing, and then they stayed that way. For the next nine days, Jackson stood still through bitter days and frozen nights. As the cold lingered, city infrastructure incurred increasingly alarming damage.

Left without water, Sulton explained his frustrations and hopes with the city. He has lived in and around Jackson since 1985, when he moved here to attend Jackson State University. He has moved around the area since then, but built his home in south Jackson in 2007, nearer to Byram but still within Jackson.

But Sulton's frustrations are not just about water.

Neglected South, West Jackson

Before the storm, Sulton and his entire neighborhood had to deal with the smell of sewage coming from what amounted to a drainage ditch that reeked like a sewage tap near their homes.

They breathed the putrid air from the fall of 2020 until recently before the winter storm hit, though Sulton is not sure if the problem might creep back up when temperatures rise.

He and his wife first lost most of their water pressure on Feb. 16, and power the next day. Their power outage lasted until Feb. 20, but as of March 2, they, like many Jackson residents, did not have working faucets or safe water.

Sulton counts himself lucky compared to some, because he is able to stay at a hotel when necessary. ""It's very frustrating, he said. Even with the ability to stay at hotels, their lives are disrupted.

""There's a lot of riding, there's a lot of driving back and forth,"" he said.

Still, Sulton has hope for Jackson.

""Jackson has so much potential,"" he said. ""I mean the entire city. I think a lot of times the leadership of the city gets pigeonholed into focusing on certain parts of the city, and I think the western and southern parts of the city get neglected. Those are the areas where you have the most people, and I think that this is putting a gigantic spotlight on that.

""It's kind of glaring that the area of the city with water is the area that the City has continually focused on and that's out north, and then the area that's been neglected is the areas that are suffering right now. So hopefully, hopefully, these spotlights will help to change some things.""

'I Owe You Honesty'

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba held numerous press events to relay the status of repairs in the city as they happened. ""I owe you honesty,"" Lumumba said on Feb. 18. ""I owe you the truth so that we can prepare for how we manage through this winter emergency.""

Even as the mayor explained how workers were clearing away tree limbs and repairing power lines, he could not give an estimate of when water might return to the city. ""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Lumumba said. ""Only to tell you that we are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover within the water system.""

As the days wore on, Lumumba and Jackson officials announced various locations for water giveaways, which are still ongoing as of press time. Non-potable water was available at fire stations around the city, and drinking water is distributed at various times and locations daily.

Even the New Orleans Pelicans basketball organization was sending two truckloads of water to Jackson after a tweet from Jackson author and superfan Angie Thomas.

""We understand our residents' frustration, I understand that most people don't care how a watch works,"" Lumumba said in a Feb. 22 press briefing. ""They just want to be able to tell time.""

Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who had endorsed Lumumba for his first term, took aim at the mayor's response, accusing his administration of being too slow to respond to the crisis and calling for faster action in distributing reserve water tankers. For his part, Lumumba defended his actions, calling the storm an ""act of God.""

'Hundred Year Old Pipes'

As the winter storm swept the country, it exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities in cities across the South.

Public Works Director Williams, who had worked with Jackson's infrastructure for 19 years before accepting his current leadership post, described the history and issues surrounding Jackson's and the country's, aging infrastructure in an interview with the Jackson Free Press on Feb. 28.

""The U.S. is not getting younger, it's getting older,"" Williams said. ""A lot of the infrastructure that was put in in the late 1800s, early 1900s. They have seen their life expectancy, but yet they're still utilizing those infrastructure assets now,"" Williams said. ""And so it's time to dedicate some resources toward upgrades.""

A 2013 water assessment concluded that Jackson did indeed have 100-year-old piping in many areas. ""Those pipes are now a lot older,"" Williams said. ""There's a lot of iron pipe in Jackson, and there's concrete pipe in Jackson, and they need to be upgraded.""

In addition to unreliable and, for now, unsafe city water mains, older residential piping may still harbor a more insidious contaminant‚Äîlead. The question of lead contamination in Jackson water remains year after year, arising especially when treated city water contains a certain chemistry capable of wearing away old lead joints in residential piping, as happened in 2016.

In that year, the alkaline levels raised concerns that treated city water may chemically melt the mineral coating on lead parts in older homes. This is the same type of alkalinity issue that arose in Flint, Mich., when that city switched water sources.

In Jackson, the majority of tested homes did not have actionable levels of lead, or more than 15 parts per billion. City officials did, however, warn that children and mothers-to-be should avoid drinking tap water until the City resolved the alkalinity issue.

Williams is not aware of any areas that still contain lead piping, but that could be due to insufficient sampling. ""There may be some isolated areas that we don't know about, but we do not know of any areas that do have lead piping or lead joints,"" he said.

Unless funding is increased for broader sampling, however, residents must make do with a do-it-yourself test kit. These kits are $15 to $20 and may be purchased from the Mississippi State Department of Health Public Health Laboratory by calling 601-576-7582 or from Micro-Methods Laboratories at 228-875-6420. The cost pays for the kit, shipping and lab results, which will take two to four weeks to return.

How to Pay for It?

Funding is the looming issue for Jackson's infrastructure upgrades. Jackson's water-treatment facilities, water-collection lines and sewer lines all require upgrades.

""I hope that after this winter storm, and we've seen the impact from Texas all the way to Mississippi and the number of residents that have suffered from a water outage, I think it shows how vulnerable our infrastructure system is and how important it is for us to have funding available to make these critical upgrades,"" Williams said Feb. 28.

""The question is, how are they going to do it? Where are they going to do it?""

As of yet, no discussions are happening between the City of Jackson and the State Legislature to resolve the water crisis, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann confirmed on March 1, indicating that it was the City's responsibility to ask for help. ""Any additional resources that we can get to help address our infrastructure problems I think it's a win-win for our citizens,"" Williams said.

Mayor Lumumba has repeatedly named $2 billion as the cost of repairing and upgrading Jackson's century-old infrastructure, but Williams says calculating an actual cost may be more difficult.

""That depends on where you would disperse those funds,"" he said. ""You've got to remember that you've got different infrastructure systems. You've got drainage issues throughout the city.

You still need funding for roads. And then you've got your utilities on water and sewer.

""So It's very hard to put an exact number on that because when you look at a city of Jackson's size and looking at all of those different infrastructure systems. You would have to look at them each independently and how you want to address them and then determine what kind of cost it would take in order to do all of them separately.""

Williams hopes federal funding will soon become a boon instead of a roadblock.

""We hope in this new administration that they will provide more infrastructure funding to the state and ultimately to municipalities like Jackson,"" he said.

""We need federal assistance in order to assist us, and then we hope that at some point a true infrastructure bill will be provided and the city will become an opportunity to benefit from some of that funding.""

For now, Jackson must wait for the all clear as repairs are completed, and the City awaits a negative test for water contamination.

11,2/28/2021 0:00,‚ÄòOur system basically crashed like a computer:‚Äô Jackson Public Works Dir. said progress made in restoring water to residents,"JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - The City of Jackson provided an update on the ongoing water crisis that began following a lengthy winter storm.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba gave an update Sunday discussing efforts to restore water to residents who‚Äôve been without it for nearly two weeks.

The mayor and public works director say the city is making progress when it comes to fully restoring everyone‚Äôs water.

However, right now some residents in South and West Jackson are still without water, and at this time Lumumba said he can‚Äôt give an exact date on when it‚Äôll be restored.

‚ÄúTime is really the solution to much of this,‚Äù the mayor said. ‚ÄúWhile we can‚Äôt give you a precise day and hour in which that water will come on, what we‚Äôre confident in is that they are working the system as it should be, they are resolving the issues.‚Äù

The city says the water system is slowly making progress.

Williams says the pressure has reached 90 psi (pounds per square inch) and they are working to stabilize the pressure.

‚ÄúWater has been restored to certain areas, what we‚Äôre trying to narrow down is, where are those areas that are still possibly without water,‚Äù said Williams. ‚ÄúRight now what we know is there are some pockets in West Jackson, and there are some areas in South Jackson.‚Äù

The public works director says they‚Äôre now trying to get enough water pressure to fill the more than a dozen storage tanks throughout the city.

This will then allow water to migrate down to the homes in South and West Jackson that currently have no water.

‚ÄúWe just left Forest Hill Road, so those residents are without,‚Äù said Williams. ‚ÄúWe also left the area of Brookleigh and they‚Äôre without water currently right now. We know that we need to continue to push pressure through the system and flow water down consistently in order to continue to build the restoration efforts for getting our residents water, so that‚Äôs just part of the entire recovery.‚Äù

The entire city has been under a Boil Water Alert for more than two weeks and those with water have been asked to conserve.

‚ÄúOur system basically crashed like a computer and we‚Äôre trying to rebuild it,‚Äù said Williams.

The city is making efforts to deliver water to those in need. Sites have been set up across the city for residents to pick up free water.

Governor Tate Reeves has activated the National Guard to help speed up the recovery efforts for the city‚Äôs water system.

As this crisis continues, it sheds another light on the city‚Äôs aging infrastructure.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said recently that it would literally cost more than a billion dollars to replace the entire water system.

He has been vocal about criticism to the city‚Äôs response to the crisis saying that what caused the outages and warnings was not incompetence but ‚Äúan act of God.‚Äù

12,4/30/2021 0:00,"Jackson residents, business owners beyond frustrated with water system issues","JACKSON, Miss. (WLBT) - As an estimated 43,000 homes in the Capital City remain under a boil water notice, many Jacksonians say they‚Äôre disappointed once again because of Friday‚Äôs treatment plant shutdown that interrupted water service for hours and the lack of timely communication that followed.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure that you don‚Äôt want people to leave, but you‚Äôre not doing anything to make us stay,‚Äù said salon owner Felicia Brisco, who told 3 On Your Side she didn‚Äôt find out about the water pressure drop until she came into work that morning.

‚ÄúWhen we tried the water and sewer, we got a busy signal. We weren‚Äôt able to get them, so we called the mayor‚Äôs office and the young lady answered the phone and said everybody had been calling because the water was out all over the city. She didn‚Äôt have any answers for me, either,‚Äù Brisco said.

Brisco wasn‚Äôt the only one who felt in the dark that morning.

Fondren resident Crystal Gates said the whole situation severely inconvenienced her because of how the water woes affected the Jackson Public School District.

‚ÄúIt was around 8:30. After my son got on the school bus, the school sent us text messages about no water or low pressure, and they were closing the school down,‚Äù Gates said. ‚ÄúThe school informed me, not the city of Jackson.‚Äù

Hours after pressure began to return to most homes, hundreds of vehicles made their way through a distribution site at the Metrocenter Mall, made up of residents getting water for their homes while they wait for another boil water notice to be lifted.

One of those in line said she feels that the city should do more, pointing to the beleaguered billing system.

‚ÄúThey take our money for the water bill. If we don‚Äôt pay it, then they‚Äôre gonna cut our water off. Why cut our water off if we ain‚Äôt got any?‚Äù said Helen Smith, who lives in south Jackson.

The city‚Äôs Code Red system also first notified residents two and a half hours after the mayor‚Äôs communication team told media outlets about the cause of the water outage.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said they‚Äôre going to look into why those notifications were delayed so long before getting to those who need that information.

13,2021-06-14 16:56:53+00:00,Jackson Maddox Well System Repairs Continue,"The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

The TV Road Well is still operating with a temporary pump. In a statement, City of Jackson Communications Director Michelle Atoa explained that a permanent pump for TV Road would be delivered and installed later this week, hopefully bringing an end to the newest manifestation of chronic water problems facing the City of Jackson.

Jackson Maddox Well System provides water to roughly 16,000 connections through six wells. The loss of operations at the two wells in May has caused outages, low water pressure, and undrinkable water for around 2,000 of those connections, located in south Jackson and Byram.

As with most water system outages, the dual well failures have put pressure on higher elevated areas first, without sufficient water output to keep the highest homes pressurized.

‚ÄúWhen you have two well systems that are down at the same time, obviously you‚Äôre not able to put as much pressure into the system as you‚Äôd like,‚Äù Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams explained at a press event last week.

A series of setbacks have extended the well failures. Last week‚Äôs inclement weather delayed the final pump installation. At the same press event, Williams acknowledged that the City of Jackson had to seek replacement pumps for the two wells out of state.

In spite of the newly installed pump at Siwell Road, the boil-water notice for affected connections remains in effect as the Mississippi State Department of Health tests the water in the affected areas: multiple days of clean samples are required before the boil water notice is lifted. Currently, MSDH is testing samples derived from well connections. Atoa told the Mississippi Free Press today that results from the testing are expected in the coming days.

Precautionary boil water notices are not a guarantee of unsafe water, but are required when pressure drops below a certain level. Under-pressurized pipes can draw in groundwater from surrounding pockets near pipe joints and breaks, potentially introducing untreated water into the low-pressure system.

‚ÄúWhen we get TV Road back online, we‚Äôll breathe a little easier,‚Äù Williams explained to WAPT News, adding that with both wells replaced, ‚Äúhopefully we‚Äôll end this particular water crisis.‚Äù

This particular crisis comes only a few months after a different segment of Jackson‚Äôs water utilities faced catastrophe, when many surface water connections tied into the city‚Äôs distribution system and water treatment plants spent nearly a month without water pressure. The Jackson water crisis revealed systemic failures to adequately repair and improve the city‚Äôs aging water infrastructure, spurred by decades of population loss and disinvestment.

The ongoing well-pump failures represent the second time in a year‚Äîthe first in September 2020‚Äîthat the Jackson Maddox Well System has experienced significant outages. In last week‚Äôs press event, Williams suggested that improper repair during that first outage contributed to the problems continuing into 2021, but promised that additional care had been taken to ensure that this set of repairs would last.","The City of Jackson has completed repairs on the Siwell Road Well in south Jackson, the first of two wells in the Jackson Maddox Well System to receive a full replacement after mid-May failures left thousands in the Jackson metropolitan area with low water pressure, potentially unsafe for consumption.

His chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor‚Äôs office was helping the city explore securing low-interest state loans to help pay for upgrades. He also noted that Mr. Lumumba had been meeting with members of the Republican-dominated State Legislature, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding.

In an interview this week, Mr. Lumumba said he hoped the current crisis would finally push both state and city officials in the direction of a long-term solution.

The city has had a dwindling tax base for decades, after the integration of schools and other public spaces in Jackson triggered a dramatic flight of white residents. In many cases, they took their wealth and tax dollars with them. In 1960, the city was about 64 percent white and 36 percent Black. Today it is about 16 percent white and 82 percent Black.

The mayor said the water crisis was an ‚Äúact of God‚Äù and not a failure of his administration or any individual. Lumumba also spoke out against what he called misinformation from Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done everything we could to secure tankers and was doing that before his rant. He talked about the tanker that was in South Jackson but failed to mention that it was the administration that is paying for that tanker. It is the administration that had the agreement with the tanker,‚Äù said Lumumba. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre leaving from council meetings distributing water to everybody across the city.‚Äù

Stokes is expected to address the mayor‚Äôs remarks during a news conference on Wednesday.

Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3. The tanker is located at 3200 Bailey Avenue, and it will be available from 11:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 23.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams said there were up to 28 water main breaks in the city. So far, 10 breaks have been repaired. He expects the water issues to be resolved by the end of the week.

Neighbors in South Jackson tend to get hit the hardest when the city has water issues. On TV Road, there is a booster station that used to be filled with water from 2014 to 2017. Now, it‚Äôs empty. Dr. Williams said it cannot be used until it reaches health standards.

‚ÄúNot right now. We‚Äôre still in a compliance issue with the State Health Department, and until we can satisfy those compliance issues, we will not be able to use that booster station,‚Äù he stated.

There‚Äôs no timeframe on when the compliance issues at the booster station will be fixed.

Leaders said the volume of calls to 311 continues to overwhelm the system. They‚Äôre asking neighbors to reserve calls for visible water leaks and urgent needs for assistance. In addition to 311, neighbors can also call 601-960-1111 or 601-960-1778.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today‚Äôs show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month. On the pandemic front, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to open up vaccine eligibility to all residents over age 16. Twenty percent of adults in Mississippi has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Public health experts are urging residents to keep wearing masks, even though the state‚Äôs Republican governor has lifted the statewide mask mandate, and to regularly wash their hands ‚Äî something that‚Äôs been hard to do for the past month in Jackson, the state‚Äôs capital, which has gone five weeks without safe drinking water.

The deadly February winter storm that left most of Texas without power for days also devastated other Southern states. In Jackson, the freezing temperatures burst pipes and water mains, leaving most of Jackson without reliable access to running water. While water delivery has largely been restored, ‚Äúboil water‚Äù orders remain in effect for most residents.

The crisis highlights how climate change threatens much of the nation‚Äôs aging infrastructure. For Jackson, there are no easy solutions. The city estimates it could cost $2 billion to fix the city‚Äôs water system, but Jackson is a poor city in the poorest state in the country. The city is 82% Black, while the state Legislature is majority white. White politicians have openly suggested Jackson‚Äôs problems are because of its Black leadership. Mississippi‚Äôs Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann criticized Jackson‚Äôs handling of the crisis by saying, quote, ‚ÄúYou remember during Kane Ditto‚Äôs administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?‚Äù Kane Ditto was Jackson‚Äôs last white mayor.

Donna Ladd of the Jackson Free Press recently wrote, quote, ‚ÄúMake no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won‚Äôt flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers.‚Äù

We go now to Jackson, Mississippi, where we‚Äôre joined by Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. He has served as mayor since 2017. His father, Chokwe Lumumba, also briefly served as mayor before dying unexpectedly in 2014 eight months into his first term.

Mayor, it‚Äôs great to have you back on Democracy Now! Your city is facing a massive crisis ‚Äî two. Of course, you‚Äôre dealing, like the whole country, with the coronavirus pandemic. And at the same time, you haven‚Äôt had clean drinking water for a month. Can you explain what‚Äôs happening and what needs to be done?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Yes. First, Amy, thank you for having me again, and thank you for lifting up this issue.

What we suffered after the two winter storms ‚Äî and I need to make certain that I clarify that, that we had two consecutive storms that took place, leaving us in prolonged low temperatures in the city of Jackson, historically low temperatures in the city of Jackson. And what it did was it created complications getting water into our treatment facility. The raw water screens are at the inception point of the water treatment facility, in which they froze. And because we couldn‚Äôt get water in, it complicated or made it impossible for us to clean water and get water out, leaving our distribution system compromised. And as consumption was high, it drained many of the tanks across the city. And our PSI ‚Äî our water treatment facility operates off of hydraulics. The PSI went down to 37. We need our PSI at about 90 in order to distribute water throughout the system.

This is on account of an aged, aging infrastructure of a legacy city, money which has not been contributed over time, while the city of Jackson contributes millions of dollars each and every year, and has done so since Kane Ditto, before Kane Ditto, and continues to do so. What we have not is had a state leadership that identifies this as not just a city of Jackson problem, but a ongoing and shared problem of not only the city, but the state. And I‚Äôd like to just emphasize that in a few ways, if I could, Amy.

One, the city of Jackson is the largest city by a factor of three, the highest contributor to revenue to the state. We are the state capital, which means that many of our properties are untaxable. We do not get payment in lieu of taxes. Furthermore, we provide water to state facilities at no cost to the state of Mississippi. So, if they just paid their water bill, the city of Jackson would be in a lot better position.

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: Well, Mayor, I wanted to ask you ‚Äî for the brief time that your father was in office, one of the things that he was praised for was attempting to address the infrastructure problem. As I recall, he tried to institute a new tax to provide better infrastructure services. What‚Äôs been the problem between the ‚Äî you mentioned one aspect, the state not paying its water bill ‚Äî but in terms of being able to implement upgrades of the system?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, I think that you would have to understand the comprehensive infrastructure problem in the city of Jackson. The 1% sales tax generates about $13 million annually. And when I said $2 billion, I didn‚Äôt say $2 billion for the water system; I said comprehensively. The way we know that is that the EPA has estimated that our wastewater problem is about a billion dollars, where sewage is coming up in people‚Äôs yards and in their backyards and in ditches, and those issues. So, that‚Äôs one. That‚Äôs before we get to the drinking water, which we see the crisis that we have on our hands after the February storms. That doesn‚Äôt get to the drainage. We suffered a 30-year flood just recently, this past ‚Äî in 2020. So, that doesn‚Äôt get to the issue of how drainage is ‚Äî how people address that. And that doesn‚Äôt get to roads and bridges and all of these things, all these parts of our infrastructure that our residents rely on. So, $13 million is just insufficient to meet the need.

The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped. And so, this is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson. Not only are we not met with a consistent plan in order to support the city that supports the state of Mississippi; we don‚Äôt enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state. But also, we‚Äôve had resources stripped away from us. You referenced the conversation, or you referenced the statements of Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann. As we have lifted up these issues year after year in our legislative agenda, understanding that it‚Äôs not a matter of if these infrastructure systems will fail, but when, he redirected the conversation to talk about the state‚Äôs effort to take over the city of Jackson‚Äôs airport, which is a profitable institution that we rely on year after year.

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: And how difficult has it been for the residents of your city to deal with the water situation while at the same time contending with the issues around the COVID pandemic?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, as you can imagine, our residents have made every endeavor to be as patient as they could. But the frustrations are high. You know, as you can imagine, when people want to drink water, cook with water, not only bathe but get rid of waste, people being concerned about not only the safety precautions of the pandemic but also taking medications, simple things like that, that they anticipate that water will help serve the need to do those things, it has been extremely difficult.

And so, you know, I do want to lift up the many people across the city, individuals, businesses, people from around the country, who have stood in the gap, rallied around the city of Jackson to distribute water. Each one of us have spent countless hours out making certain that we got water to the elderly, to the immobile, to the disabled. And so, while there has been great frustration around these issues, these are issues that the residents of Jackson have dealt with for quite some time, and so they‚Äôre very familiar, they‚Äôre intimately familiar, with the history of divestment, the history of a lack of investment from the state, very familiar with the woes and troubles of our water infrastructure and our infrastructure in a comprehensive way, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Calandra Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute. She has been delivering bottled water and food to those without water supply.

CALANDRA DAVIS: The communities that was hardest hit by this water crisis are in South and West Jackson, which, again, are the predominantly or majority Black and Brown communities in the city. So, again, it just shows that it wasn‚Äôt just another bad weather day for us, that this has been, again, years of neglect to the majority Black and Brown parts of the city, also just another example of how structural racism works.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you explain how people are getting water? I mean, if people can‚Äôt afford to buy water, how do they get to places where water is, or have to go to pick it up? One older woman described the only thing she could get was little bottled water. This is to keep themselves clean. It‚Äôs not just for drinking.

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, you know, along with the complication of a water treatment facility essentially crashing during the storm, we also had the challenge for several days because roads were iced over and the transportation or distribution system was interrupted on our highways. And so, it became complicated because the local stores didn‚Äôt have water anymore. It became complicated because ‚Äî it was increasingly challenging because trucks could not come and deliver water. But we were able to manage through that and set up distribution sites across the city. The state National Guard did set up tanks around the city for non-potable water, for people to come with containers and utilize. As I mentioned, you had several businesses, several individuals, that stood in the gap in order to support people in that way.

I do want to lift up the issue that Ms. Davis spoke to: the equity issues. You know, it is not a system where you turn on water from one area of town or another area of town. The system distributes water through the lines that were laid, actually, more than a hundred years ago. The problem is an issue of equity. We just have to understand when the take took place. The take happened, or the issues of people who are in poverty or don‚Äôt have the resources not being able to get the water, is because they live in areas that were not valued as high or as more desirable by those who had money. Those who had money built homes near ‚Äî closest to the resources, closer to the water treatment facilities. Therefore, when water is redistributed through the distribution system, through the lines, they are the ones who get water sooner. When you get to South and West Jackson, those are the areas furthest away from the plant. Those are the areas at higher elevations across the city, which means that the water not only has to travel far, but it has to travel high. It has to go up those high elevation points.

And so, you know, we must lift up not only how we build sustainable infrastructure, but how we do it in an equitable way, looking at these issues and looking at how we address those areas through city planning. And city planning is never neutral. City planning is not by mistake. We have to be able to make sure that we do this in a way that creates dignity for all residents across our city.

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: And, Mayor, on this issue of equitable distribution of resources and services, years ago, your father pioneered the Jackson-Kush Plan, an attempt to empower African Americans in the majority area, geographical areas of the South. How do you assess the progress that‚Äôs been made, beginning with his administration, but then going through yours, in terms of spreading this idea of the equitable distribution of resources?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, that is a movement that is ongoing. And we have many successes to point to in that regard. What our goal is, is to democratize power, understanding that issues of infrastructure, that we need to be able to connect, pothole to pothole, in community to community, so people in Jackson, Mississippi, understand why there‚Äôs a community that looks just like theirs in Jamaica, Queens, New York, in Gary, Indiana, or Detroit, Michigan. In that process of fixing that pothole, in that process of how we repair our infrastructure in terms of water, what we ultimately learn is that the pothole was never your problem in the first place. Your problem is that you don‚Äôt control the decision-making process that leads to the pothole being fixed.

And so, we do that by having people‚Äôs assemblies where we engage community. We do that by participatory budgeting, understanding that the budget of the city is a moral document, and if we don‚Äôt listen to the community, listen to what the community needs and scratch where they may be itching, then it reflects what our values are as a community. We‚Äôve done that through making sure that we extend a model which is just and transparent as we look at the issues of public safety and policing, not only making sure that we have a police ID task force populated by the community, so that they can work alongside the police department and understand how public safety must look. And so, we‚Äôve done that in a number of ways. We‚Äôre are looking at that in terms of economic mobility and economic development in the community, understanding that we want to be a business-friendly city, but we also understand that it has to be a reciprocal relationship. And so, we lift up cooperative business models, as well, so that we can learn how we can fill the gaps.

Even as we have this conversation about water and the issue of water over the last month or so, the reality is that every effort in order to support the infrastructure of the city of Jackson has been undertaken by the residents, by the people, more than the state itself. The decision to tax themselves more in order to help the infrastructure was supported over 90% by the residents. The state isn‚Äôt filling in the gap or standing in the gap when people decide to tax themselves more. Those are people taking the issue in their own hands, realizing that we are who we‚Äôve been waiting on. And so, we should be met in that way.

AMY GOODMAN: Mayor, very quickly, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to offer vaccines to everyone above 16. At the same time, the mask mandate has been lifted. The significance of this for your city, for Jackson?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, it‚Äôs a contradictory message, and I believe that it is dangerous. While we are happy that we can expand the opportunity for people to be vaccinated, every health professional that I have listened to, all the health professionals we listen to nationally, have indicated that it is just too soon in order to lift the mask mandate.

The city of Jackson, we execute our COVID policy based on science, not politics. And so, we will maintain our mask mandate in the city of Jackson. However, the state‚Äôs decision to do otherwise still puts us in a compromised position, because we‚Äôre not only the capital city, we‚Äôre the capital of healthcare. What that means is, is as surrounding cities may not issue the mask mandate, when their residents, unfortunately, fall victim to the virus, they will overburden our hospitals in the city of Jackson, leaving not only our residents in greater danger, but those individuals who seek hospitalization or seek medical attention for a myriad of other issues, even outside of COVID. And so, I think that it is contradictory. I think that it is confusing. And I think that it is ill-timed.

AMY GOODMAN: Chokwe Antar Lumumba, we thank you so much for being with us, mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, longtime activist.

Next up, Deb Haaland is being sworn in as secretary of the interior, becoming the first Native American to serve in a U.S. presidential cabinet. We‚Äôll look at what she faces when it comes to the legacy of uranium mines. Stay with us.","AMY GOODMAN: We begin today‚Äôs show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month.
In Jackson, the freezing temperatures burst pipes and water mains, leaving most of Jackson without reliable access to running water.
So, if they just paid their water bill, the city of Jackson would be in a lot better position.
MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, I think that you would have to understand the comprehensive infrastructure problem in the city of Jackson.
AMY GOODMAN: Chokwe Antar Lumumba, we thank you so much for being with us, mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, longtime activist."

18,1/19/2018 0:00,"Jackson's 'Deplorable' Pipes Still Bursting, Causing School Closures","¬ó The City of Jackson is somewhere between praising its public-works department for its hard work this year and quickly patching the aging infrastructure and pipes so that all citizens and businesses can have water and children can go back to school.

Director of Public Works Bob Miller said at a press conference at City Hall this afternoon that 210 water mains have broken since the beginning of the year‚Äî54 of those happened this week alone. For now, the water is drinkable system-wide, however, he said.

""The most beneficial thing that citizens can do for the Jackson water system, as we've noted before, (is) if you see something, say something,"" Miller said. He encourages anyone who sees leaks bubbling up in the streets to call 311 to report the specific issue and find out what is happening at that spot. The 311 call center will be open over the weekend from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m. Jacksonians can also call if they are in need of water.

A combination of customer demand plus the water-main breaks pulls more water out of the system than it can handle, hence the breaks, Miller says. Today he confirmed 16 breaks, and anticipates that we are in the ""peak of the worst of it,"" currently.

Jackson Public Schools called for a district-wide early dismissal today when they realized after school began this morning that several water-main breaks left 60 percent of schools with low or inadequate water pressure. Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for school districts affected by winter weather beginning Jan. 15. The Mississippi Board of Education has the authority to decide if schools will make up missed days this week. This does not cover the days JPS missed before Jan. 15.

Miller is hopeful because in the thick of the emergency in the beginning of January, the peak number of water-main breaks in a single day was 22, and we are not only below that daily number to date, but he says the City and the water treatment plants are ""better positioned"" during this run of main breaks.

Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba asked for continued patience as his administration works as hard as possible, although he understands parents' and business owners' frustrations. He added that Jackson's issues fit in with a national trend of crumbling infrastructure in major cities that are coming to light as the weather plummets and rises. ""We have 100-year-old pipes, and they don't consult with us before they decide to break,"" the mayor said. Lumumba re-characterized the pipes as equivalent to ""peanut brittle,"" as Miller called them previously in an interview with the Jackson Free Press.

The mayor also likened the situation of the pipes in ""deplorable condition"" to what happens when you heat a coffee mug in a microwave and then immediately put it in the refrigerator‚Äîthe mug will likely crack because of the stark temperature differences. It is the same for pipes.

""Big transitions in temperatures for pipes cause issues‚Äîthat's why they break,"" Lumumba said. ""As we dealt with the cold wave, that caused the initial surge of pipe breaks. As we deal with temperatures heating back up now we expect that there may be additional breaks that will occur.""

Lumumba thanked the Madison County School District for donating water to south Jackson schools. South Jackson is farthest away from the treatment facilities, so residents there will likely have lower pressure, as pressure decreases the longer it travels away from the plants. The mayor also thanked businesses that choose to stay in the City despite the infrastructure issues.

Ward 6 Councilman Aaron Banks said he rode to check on Forest Hill High School, which opened Thursday despite not having water, and saw public-works crews working in the ground and mud to fix pipes. Banks encouraged citizens to pull together with hope and in support of the workers out fixing the pipes.

""Our workers are committed to getting this done,"" he said. ""This is not a time to panic this is not the titanic‚ÄîJackson's not going down, alright?""

The mayor said he's prioritizing the ""urgency of now,"" but also made time for CAO Robert Blaine to speak about long-term plans for infrastructure to survive fluctuating temperatures.

""We are in the process of developing an integrated infrastructure plan,"" Blaine said. ""We have developed relationships in order to be able to seek funding from the state and federal level, and we are looking to be aggressive in how we look forward so we can mitigate against future challenges that we might have with our infrastructure.""

Lumumba added that the City would not turn away federal or state funding to help with financing the response to water-main fractures.

Three city crews and five contractor crews are out working today, and Miller said he will add more over the weekend.

19,3/14/2021 0:00,Opinion: Jackson water crisis shows Nina Simone is still right about Mississippi,"Keri Leigh Merritt is a historian, writer and filmmaker from Atlanta. She is the author of ""Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South."" Follow her @KeriLeighMerrit . The views expressed here are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Summoned to the South by Marian Wright of the NAACP, Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph Clark traveled to the Mississippi Delta in the Spring of 1967 to assess the effectiveness of the federal War on Poverty programs. Wright had testified before Congress that the people of her state were starving and in agony. Although forewarned, the White senators were stunned to witness the extremities of Mississippi's soul-crushing poverty, right in the middle of one of the wealthiest nations on earth.

The depth of Mississippi's poverty was almost too much for Kennedy to bear. Speaking mournfully about ""children with distended stomachs,"" Kennedy urged the federal government to do something to alleviate the state's widespread ""suffering."" Deeming ""housing inadequate"" and commenting on the ""insufficient clothing"" of the state's impoverished children, he rightfully concluded that Mississippi was a ""terrible reflection on our society.""

Now, 54 years later, it is necessary to ask the federal government to intervene in the state again. Many of the primarily Black residents of Mississippi's capital, Jackson, spent weeks without running water after a cold spell burst a huge number of the city's pipes. According to Mississippi Today, o ver 40,000 people , the equivalent of a sold-out game at Wrigley Field, were not able to drink, bathe or wash clothes, dishes, hands or even flush toilets -- all during a pandemic.

A brother and sister sit while their mother volunteers at a water and food distribution drive in Jackson, Mississippi after the city was hit by back-to-back winter storms.

Over the past several days, the city has made significant progress in repairs, restoring water to most of its residents. However, two major, potentially deadly issues remain . First, the water pressure is extremely low and unreliable in certain neighborhoods, particularly in the poorer parts of south Jackson. More importantly, city testing has revealed that the water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink, as USA Today reported , ""because of high turbidity -- cloudiness that increases the possibility water might contain disease-causing organisms.""

The capital of an American state is still under a boil-water advisory -- an advisory originally issued nearly a month ago, on February 16 . Jackson's problems, like those of so many other US towns and cities, are a blight on the political ideals White Americans traditionally claim.

Jackson, Mississippi, is a microcosm of our nation's massive failures to make amends for centuries of colonialism, slavery and racism. The story of Jackson is like those of Flint, Michigan; Centreville, Illinois; and Shreveport, Louisiana. While the details from each city may vary, the core issue that binds these places together in anguish is painfully obvious.

And poor and working-class whites historically have been all-too-willing to join in this Faustian bargain.

JUST WATCHED Covid restrictions end in Mississippi Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Covid restrictions end in Mississippi 07:34

The few repairs that have been made have mostly been in affluent, largely White north Jackson , clearly delineating not just the privileges, but the power of Whiteness. As State Representative Christopher M. Bell rightly told me, ""My colleagues at the Mississippi Capitol have a history of accusing the City of Jackson's legislative delegation of asking for handouts versus help. They however have a different view of the predominantly White communities surrounding Jackson when they request support.""

""The infrastructure challenges in Jackson and in similar Black communities across the country are inextricably linked to a legacy of racism, redlining, gerrymandering and systematic disinvestment in our communities over decades,"" Mayor Lumumba wrote in a statement Saturday. ""It has compounded over time and now we must reconcile with how we fix it and find solutions forward. We must move away from a system of exclusion and exploitation, and towards a just city model.""

The mayor's words ring true: According to Talk Poverty , as of 2020, nearly one-fifth of Mississippi's total population have incomes below the poverty line. The burden is even worse for the state's children, of whom an astounding 28% live in daily poverty. Among US states and the District of Columbia, Mississippi ranks dead last -- 51st -- for overall poverty.

Other Talk Poverty statistics reveal the staggering correlation between race and poverty. While 12% of Mississippi's White population lives in poverty, the numbers rise to close to 30.5%, 31% for African Americans and 32% for Native Americans.

As if the misery of a state awash in destitution, pain and suffering was not enough, Mississippi also has the odious distinction of ranking 49th in unemployment, 44th in higher education attainment, 50th in teen birth rate, 49th in assets and savings and 51st, dead last once again, for hunger and food insecurity.

To make matters even worse, nearly a quarter of the state's population had no health insurance at any time during 2020's pandemic. Simply put, Mississippi is one of the poorest, sickest states in the US.

Although reparate is no longer a common word, it is the key to successfully addressing reparations. To reparate means to restore something to a state of good repair; it means returning something to working order. Reparative justice means to right the wrongs of the past -- not only by acknowledging the harms of certain groups of people both in the past and the present, but also addressing those harms and working to ameliorate them.

As Nina Simone so brilliantly wrote about reparative justice in her iconic song ""Mississippi Goddam,"" time is always of the essence:

But that's just the trouble

""do it slow""

Desegregation

""do it slow""

Mass participation

""do it slow""

Reunification

""do it slow""

Do things gradually

""do it slow""

But bring more tragedy.

While many White Mississippians in power like Tate Reeves and other GOP leaders -- wittingly or not -- extend the legacies of racism and the slaveholders' Confederacy and fail to act as White supremacy keeps state's people ensnared in extreme poverty, the time for federal intervention is now. If the leaders of the state will not repair and restore Jackson's water system, then the leaders of the country must step in to help right the wrongs of the past.

From immediately sending FEMA in to deal with Jackson's short-term problems to passing a Federal Jobs Guarantee that focuses, first and foremost, on reparative justice, the Biden administration and the Democratic Congress -- if they truly espouse the values they campaigned upon -- should act swiftly and thoroughly.

In 1968, less than a year after Senator Kennedy's Mississippi trip, Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that ""There is nothing new about poverty. What is new is that we now have the techniques and the resources to get rid of poverty. The real question is whether we have the will.""

It is nothing short of a moral and ethical tragedy -- an indictment of the entire country -- that our citizens are being deprived of clean running water in one of the richest nations on earth. It is well past time for immediate federal action. We must have the will.

20,,Jackson‚Äôs water crisis,"February‚Äôs winter storm had more of an impact than just power outages and icy roads. It crippled the city of Jackson‚Äôs water system to the point of widespread loss of pressure and a citywide boil water advisory, something unprecedented for the seat of a state‚Äôs government.

As in winter‚Äôs past, Jackson‚Äôs water system has been put under duress, with several water main breaks and boil water notices commonplace. However, a colossal failure of this magnitude has not been seen in quite some time, indicative of the true shape of the city‚Äôs infrastructure. A boil water advisory was issued on February 16 and was lifted on March 17. This means Jackson homes and businesses had unsafe drinking water flowing through their systems for just over a month, which is unheard of in modern America.

Even more incredible is the fact that some connections still had no running water at all, three weeks later. Not even potable water, such as that used to flush toilets. South Jackson was hit especially hard by this water outage, as it is further away from the city‚Äôs main water facility, the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant.

At the top of city leadership, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has asked state officials for $47 million dollars to help fix the city‚Äôs broken infrastructure. He has also proposed a one percent sales tax hike on top of the existing one percent, resulting in a two percent added sales tax in Jackson. Recently, he has sparred with Mississippi‚Äôs Lieutenant Governor, Delbert Hosemann, over comments Lumumba alleged he made during a meeting between the two. He says that Hosemann attempted to extort him by using the Jackson Airport as leverage, a property the city currently owns.

Politics aside, the water crisis is truly a monumental event in Jackson‚Äôs history, serving as yet another reminder of the need to replace an old and unreliable infrastructure system.","It crippled the city of Jackson‚Äôs water system to the point of widespread loss of pressure and a citywide boil water advisory, something unprecedented for the seat of a state‚Äôs government.

21,,"No 'definitive timeline' when water will return to Jackson, Mississippi: Mayor","""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Jackson's public works director said.

As power and water outages rock the South, among the hard-hit cities is Jackson, Mississippi, where most residents face little to no water pressure.

""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover.""

""This becomes increasingly challenging"" due to the pandemic, Lumumba said, because so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the length of the cold snap in Jackson has taken a toll on the water production.

""Hopefully by this weekend you will start seeing some pressure build back up and water will slowly be restored,"" Williams said Thursday, adding that it's difficult to give a timeline because the weather impacts are ""unpredictable.""

""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Williams said. ""We're working around the clock.""

On Friday, Williams told reporters there was some progress in the city's water pressure, but it was still hard to predict when people will get their water back. Those who live closer to the city's two water plants should expect to have water sooner than those who live farther away, he said.

Water main breaks are another concern; as of Friday afternoon, there were 13 in the city, with more expected as the ice and snow melts, Williams said.

""We hope that it does not increase very much because that will delay some of the recovery process,"" he said.

A boil water notice was issued Thursday.

Jackson officials are offering water distribution at several sites Friday.

Besides the water emergency, between 18,000 to 19,000 customers in Jackson were without power Thursday, largely due to limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain, the mayor said.

Lumumba warned that roads are still topped with ice and urged caution while driving to get basic necessities.

""This is the time ... to help one another, especially our most vulnerable constituents,"" City Council President Aaron Banks said.

After a week of historic and disastrous snow, ice and cold in the South, the freezing temperatures will soon lift. A hard freeze warning is in effect in Mississippi Friday morning but temperatures are expected to rise this weekend.

22,2021-02-28 00:47:35.423000+00:00,Frustrated Jackson Locals Are Nearing Two Weeks With No Water,"For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

For professional chef Enrika Williams, who lives in south Jackson with four other family members, it was a scramble when news began circulating around Valentine‚Äôs Day of an unexpected cold front where temperatures dropped into the teens.

Worried her pipes might freeze, quick-thinking Williams filled up her bathtub in case of such an event. Unfortunately for her and thousands of others, the unseasonably frigid weather caused the city‚Äôs outdated water equipment¬≠‚Äìwhich can‚Äôt handle wintery conditions‚Äìto freeze and water lines to burst.

The result was dire, leading the city to issue a boil-water advisory and set up distribution sites for flushing water and bottled drinking water, with hundreds waiting in line with empty buckets for hours.

Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home. She bought water wherever she could, shelling out $100 on bottled water to cook and clean with.

Nearby family members who happened to have water opened up their home so Williams, her mother, two siblings, and niece could wash their clothes and take a shower.

For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

While Williams finally has water again, albeit trickling, she voiced her dissatisfaction with the city‚Äôs everchanging timeframe of when the water would be running again.

‚ÄúThe thing that became frustrating was the tone of accountability just wasn‚Äôt there,‚Äù Williams told The Daily Beast. ‚ÄúThere was no plan that we could see. The press conferences were redundant. If you don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs coming back, what is being done to help us?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere wasn‚Äôt anyone at the forefront who gave a damn, so to speak,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt makes you feel a lot of things. You just expect better.‚Äù

In Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new. Six years ago the city approved a 1 percent sales tax increase with the goal of updating all of its aging infrastructure, but the $15 million it generates annually is only a fraction of the $2 billion Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the city will need. Long before the current crisis hit, one popular local t-shirt read ‚ÄúWelcome to Boil Water Alert, Mississippi.‚Äù

What‚Äôs different this time, residents say, is the sheer scale‚Äîthe entire city is either without water or under a boil water alert.

‚Äú It‚Äôs not like this is everywhere. It‚Äôs where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives. ‚Äù ‚Äî Laurie Bertram Roberts

More than a few residents have noted that the crisis has hit south and west Jackson hardest while leaving northeast Jackson, the one predominantly white corner of this 80 percent Black capital city, relatively unscathed. Over the past several days, Laurie Bertram Roberts, who runs the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, has used the fund to distribute more than 130 cases of water to residents, with plans to deliver another 80 tomorrow.

‚ÄúPart of the problem is that it‚Äôs everywhere,‚Äù Roberts said. ‚ÄúUsually when we have an outage it‚Äôs in one neighborhood, so people are used to running over to their friends‚Äô house or their auntie‚Äôs house to take a shower or fill up some jugs. Usually, you can grab your buckets and find some place to fill them, whatever. But when it‚Äôs the whole damn city? Where are the Black people supposed to go? It‚Äôs not like this is everywhere. It‚Äôs where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives.‚Äù

Jackson, which has a population of around 160,000, has a 26.9 percent poverty rate. Williams explained that a lot of people don‚Äôt have the resources to go out and buy additional water to cook and bathe with.

‚ÄúPeople can‚Äôt afford that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWater is a basic necessity and it just brought a lot of frustration, anger, and disappointment.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe aren‚Äôt out of the woods yet. There‚Äôs still a lot of people without water.‚Äù

While Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday night that he would ‚Äúrestore clean water‚Äù and send in the National Guard and tanker trucks with non-potable water in effort to relieve the issue, conditions still hadn‚Äôt improved by Saturday.

Fed-up locals flooded the city‚Äôs Facebook page to demand answers.

‚ÄúDay 12 and not even a drip at my house,‚Äù Dwight Pugh wrote. ‚ÄúNEVER have we had disrupted this long.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear that the city government doesn‚Äôt have the resources or the ability to manage things, and they‚Äôre getting worse, rather than better,‚Äù John Zer added.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been two weeks and I know families with infants who don‚Äôt have water. The city needs help,‚Äù Jamario Townsend chimed in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thankful my water is trickling out enough to flush my toilet but dang. This just needs to be fixed at this point. It just needs to be fixed.‚Äù

Many directed their anger towards Democratic Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who had pleaded with his constituents to have ‚Äúpatience‚Äù while admitting there was ‚Äúno definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.‚Äù

‚Äú This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents. ‚Äù ‚Äî Mayor Chokwe Lumumba

Accused of being too slow to reach out to Reeves for assistance, Lumumba claimed the Republican governor wouldn‚Äôt return any of his phone calls. Reeves‚Äô camp quickly fired back that the governor had no missed calls from Lumumba.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, ‚ÄúThe challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different. This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur systems were never meant to endure days of ice storms and sub-zero temperatures coupled by road conditions that prevented the delivery of critical supplies,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt has been a difficult few weeks. Our recovery efforts continue. We are not there yet, but we are doing everything we can to restore water to Jackson residents.‚Äù

Reeves seems to agree, saying earlier in the week that Jackson‚Äôs water systems problems date back to ‚Äú50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we‚Äôre going to fix in the next six to eight hours,‚Äù he added.","For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.
Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home.
For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
You just expect better.‚ÄùIn Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new.
In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, ‚ÄúThe challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different."
23,,"Jackson, Mississippi, residents remain without water for more than 2 weeks after storm","Winter storms that passed through the South last month caused long-term damage in several states, with millions in Texas without power and water for days. While the focus was on the Lone Star State, Jackson, Mississippi continues to suffer from storm-related issues as well.

In anticipation of a storm on February 14, Mississippi Governor Reeves and Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann declared a state of emergency. The storm left thousands in the state without power, which has since been nearly fully restored.

However, Jackson is still feeling the effects of the storm, with a boil water notice still in place, more than two weeks after the snowstorm. Reeves also activated the National Guard to help with water distribution efforts in the area. And the city has set up several sites for distribution of non-potable or flushing water this week.

""Over the course of this crisis, 80 total water main breaks/ leaks have been reported throughout the City,"" according to a press release from the city. As of Sunday evening, 51 repairs had been completed by the Water Maintenance Department, which was continuing to work on repairs.

In addition to boiling water during the crisis, residents are also being asked to limit their usage of water. A representative for the city of Jackson told CBS News that it is unclear how many people were without water, as the system ‚Äî which services 43,000 customers ‚Äî is old. The way the city counts and records water outages is by people calling them in.

In a press conference about the city's water supply on Sunday, Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the lack of water is an issue of health and sanitation. ""We have seen several areas that have been without water that are starting to see water, but we are certainly nowhere near ready to claim victory until every single resident has the restoration of their water,"" Lumumba said.

City engineer Dr. Charles Williams said Sunday was a ""much better day"" than the previous one. ""The complex nature of it is, our system crashed, like a computer, and now we're trying to rebuild it,"" he said. ""And so, the progress has been very slow.""

Williams said once water tanks throughout the city are refilled using water supplies from two plants, city officials will focus on lifting water boil notices.

""I know residents are trying to understand this process and be patient ‚Äî they just want to see water,"" Lumumba said. ""I think it's important to start with the understanding that what we have faced and what we have seen as a result of the winter storm, water treatment facilities are not meant to shut down at the level that we experienced.""

Broken water mains in Jackson, Mississippi, have played havoc with residences and many businesses and restaurants, such as Barrelhouse in the historic Fondren business district on Tuesday, February 23, 2021. Rogelio V. Solis / AP

Lumumba said because the water facilities shut down, ""the process of getting it moving back to where it was before the storm is a difficult recovery process."" The mayor also said that Jackson is a ""legacy city"" and it needs long-term support to deal with the water issue ""that has gone decades without being addressed sufficiently.""

He said Jackson is an ""aging city with an aging budget"" with about a $300 million annual budget and ""more than likely, a more than $2 billion issue with our infrastructure."" He did not specify a timeline for when water would be restored. CBS News has reached out to Lumumba, Williams and the city's council and public works department for statement or comment and is awaiting response.

Last week, city council member Kenny Stokes criticized Lumumba's response to the storms, saying during a news conference on Wednesday that the ""City of Jackson has suffered unduly because of the rookie mistakes of the mayor.""

This came after Lumumba said during a city council meeting a week ago that Stokes spread misinformation about the relief efforts following the storm.

Lumumba also defended his administration's response to the crisis during a press conference Tuesday: ""We offer as proof of the fact that this is an act of God is you just simply have to look at all of the places that this weather affected, and the fact that communities are experiencing the same trauma that our residents are experiencing today ‚Äî Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas Canton, Mississippi, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Louisiana, and many more.

""It was an act of God, extreme weather, that sent old systems into havoc and put our residents in trauma,"" Lumumba said. ""In moments of crisis, the first casualty is trust, which is why I'm calling up not only the media, but our council people."" He then said ""misinformation"" had been spread.

During his press conference, Stokes refuted Lumumba's claims that he had spread misinformation, saying: ""Tell me one thing that I said that was wrong. I showed you the people who have no water. I showed you the people who can't flush toilets.""

CBS News has reached out to Lumumba and Stokes for comment on this and is awaiting response.

While city officials argued in the press, Jackson residents and many others posted their frustrations with the situation on social media. ""Trying not to complain but this is so wild. Tomorrow will be the beginning of the third week that I and so many others in Jackson have been without water. I'm not blaming anybody because these problems pre-date our leadership,"" Arekia S. Bennett, a teacher and director of Mississippi Votes, tweeted.

Bennett also shared a link to the non-profit Shower Power, a mobile shower unit brought to cities in need. Shower Power will be in Jackson to provide clean showers to people without water.

""The entire city of Jackson, Mississippi, either has no water or is under a boil water alert. It's been 2 weeks now, going on week 3. Why isn't this getting the attention Texas got?"" another resident tweeted.

Activist Erin Brockovich also tweeted about the water issues: ""Big money but bad or no water!! Jackson, Mississippi, has been without water for a week.""

""Not only was the city's water treatment plant knocked offline but the governor has dispatched the National Guard to bring water to the city's 160,000 residents,"" she wrote.

""How is it that the people of a state's capital city in the richest nation on earth have been without running water for two weeks now? How is it that there are no ongoing conversations between Mississippi's governor/legislature and Jackson's mayor? Jackson is 82% Black,"" Ashton Pittman, senior reporter for the Mississippi Free Press, tweeted.","While the focus was on the Lone Star State, Jackson, Mississippi continues to suffer from storm-related issues as well.

It has been a long two weeks and counting for Arekia Bennett. Weeks after a vicious winter storm blew through the Gulf Coast, Bennett and other residents in Jackson, Mississippi, were still without water.

A resident of South Jackson, Bennett says water issues have happened before, but nothing like the current crisis.

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt like I‚Äôve never been without water before,‚Äù Bennett told NewsOne in a recent interview. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think my family has gone over two or three days, three days max [without water].‚Äù

On Tuesday, Bennett traveled to her brother‚Äôs house in North Jackson to take advantage of his running water. She said depending on traffic, the commute can take her 40 minutes.

‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt like bothering people,‚Äù Bennett explained. ‚ÄúSo, I haven‚Äôt been over here as much.‚Äù

As the lead for Mississippi Votes, Bennett is used to navigating tough situations. Founded in 2016, Mississippi Votes is a civic engagement organization committed to the state‚Äôs progression. The organization partnered in grassroot relief efforts immediately after the storms. She and her colleagues also raised funds to support student organizers and impacted staff at Mississippi Votes.

But Bennet said by last Sunday, the frustration caught up with her.

‚ÄúAnybody that knows me knows I love Jackson,‚Äù Bennett explained. ‚ÄúI want to be here, but I think I‚Äôm the most frustrated I‚Äôve ever been.‚Äù

She said her frustration, like many residents, was not an indictment of any particular city elected official. But such feelings should be expected considering the ongoing conditions.

A Series of Unfortunate Events

The combination of the unusually severe weather and an aging water system in serious disrepair has made it difficult to restore service.

Bennett recognizes the politics of the current situation and the ongoing dynamic between the overwhelmingly Black capital city and the majority white state leadership. She also cited the historical disinvestment in Jackson and other majority Black communities across the state. Jackson has a population that is 82% Black.

‚ÄúBlack folks in Jackson aren‚Äôt crazy,‚Äù Bennett said while explaining how many people know the current crisis is part of a larger issue that predates city leadership. ‚ÄúIt is hard for that to be the centerpiece of the conversation because people‚Äôs material conditions are not being met.‚Äù

City Engineer Charles Williams Jr., Ph.D., said the city made some progress in its efforts but there was still much work ahead. In an email to NewsOne, Williams explained that the current crisis differed from past incidents given a combination of issues resulting from the winter storm.

‚ÄúIn this scenario the plant has major trouble bringing in raw water for treatment,‚Äù Williams wrote.

He said freezing temperatures led to several days of mechanical and electrical issues. A snowball effect, these issues led to trouble maintaining water pressure, which caused an outage affecting a majority of residents in Jackson as well as customers in the nearby city of Byram.

Williams also said that in the past three to five years, the city received two state revolving loans for roughly $20 million to make repairs on the water system. He estimated $15 million had been spent to date ‚Äî a drop in the bucket compared to the overall estimated cost of replacing the aging system with a price tag in the billions.

In a Tuesday city council session, a question was raised concerning an inoperable booster station, which houses water pumps and pipes. Williams explained the city was working to address a prior compliance issue with the Mississippi Department of Health.

‚ÄúWe are submitting information regarding a corrosion control study for review and approval by the Mississippi Department of Health,‚Äù Williams told NewsOne.

Some council members suggested that part of any resolution to the issue should include an increased investment in the city‚Äôs Public Works Department. Williams told NewsOne that preventing this type of catastrophe required capital projects for both water distribution and water treatment facilities.

As of Tuesday night, the city had received reports of 99 water main breaks. Of those, 59 were repaired and another eight had been verified as actual water main breaks. The remaining 32 reported breaks were awaiting confirmation.

Not Only A Jackson Problem

Jackson isn‚Äôt the only part of Mississippi struggling without water. Danyelle Holmes, an organizer with the Mississippi Poor People‚Äôs Campaign, explained that several rural communities had similar difficulties but lacked the attention and support of Jackson.

‚Äú[This] is not just happening in Jackson,‚Äù said Holmes, who called the widespread infrastructure problems a failure of state government. ‚ÄúThis is an issue with crumbling infrastructure across the state of Mississippi, not just in Jackson.‚Äù

Holmes added: ‚ÄúRural communities were impacted and are not receiving any resources. Or [they] have not been fortunate to have community organizations to come in and push and get those resources to the rural areas.‚Äù

With more than 40 years in the state of Mississippi, and at least 20 years in the city of Jackson, Holmes said she had never seen anything like the current water crisis. Holmes said her organization provided support to folks in Claiborne County and its county seat Port Gibson. They dropped off non-potable water (for flushing) and bottled water to the area over the weekend.

Holmes also reported hearing of issues in several Mississippi Delta communities as well as the city of Belzoni and Tallahatchie County. Many of those areas have also been hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Between Feb. 25 and March 1, several areas of Hind County, where Jackson is located, had their water determined to be safe to drink.

She said that not receiving a federal disaster declaration put a strain on those who are poor or with low wealth. ‚Äú[People] are already struggling to survive during this pandemic, at no fault of their own, and many of these folks are part of the working class,‚Äù Holmes shared.

The winter storm further exacerbated things for many people, particularly those who may have missed income due to the storm. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs income that has been taken away from their household, on top of [everything else].‚Äù

Holmes sees a disparity in the communities allowed to go without a necessity like water. She said that other areas in the state had issues with their water system crashing but were back up and running without the same extended delay.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all taxpaying citizens of the state of Mississippi,‚Äù Holmes said. ‚ÄúWe all deserve the same services, extended to us from our governor across the state.‚Äù

Bennett agreed.

‚ÄúPeople in Jackson deserve the same type of regular response that you would give to a place like Oxford if they were without water for 10 days,‚Äù she said referencing the home of Ole Miss. ‚ÄúBecause Oxford, Mississipp, will never be without water.‚Äù

Both Bennet and Holmes said the current situation drives home the reality of climate change.

‚ÄúWe understand and know that climate change is real,‚Äù Holmes said. ‚ÄúWe have to better prepare our communities and start educating our communities on what is climate change, how it impacts our communities, and the effects that it has.‚Äù

Bennett said that consideration of the racial factors running through the current crisis and historic infrastructure disinvestment go along with thinking about climate justice.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna be important to start thinking equitably about our resources and how we‚Äôre prioritizing people in times of crisis,‚Äù reflected Bennett.

The storm left millions in the South without heat or water as temperatures fell well below freezing for days on end, resulting in more than 70 deaths in Texas alone.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)

Services across the South remain fragile or in a damaged state. Despite the restoration of water service, Jackson officials have maintained a boil-water advisory long after the extreme weather has dissipated, affecting more than 70 percent of residents.

The boil-water notice has remained, preventing thousands of residents from using water for drinking, cooking, washing and bathing. Leaks and breaks in watermains caused by the freezing weather depleted the city‚Äôs water supply, cutting service for many weeks. Surface water samples are being sent to the Mississippi State Health Department (MSHD) this week to determine whether the boil-water advisory may be lifted.

No fewer than 120 samples from various locations throughout the city will need to pass the sampling tests for two consecutive days for the boil-water notice to be lifted. However, the city lifted a precautionary boil-water notice for the 16,000 connections served by the Jackson Maddox Well System last week on Wednesday.

At the peak of the crisis, approximately 160,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring cities like Clinton, Pearl and Byram were estimated to have lost water service. This was due to water pressure plummeting from its proper working level of 80 to 90 pounds per square inch (psi) to 37 psi. According to city officials, the water pressure has returned to normal. As the city has yet to prove that most of its water is safe for consumption residents remain reliant upon charity and donations from neighboring cities and states.

The antiquated water system in Mississippi‚Äôs capital city, which has components over a century old, was found in 2016 to have elevated levels of lead, prompting comparisons to the water crisis in Flint, Michigan. Century-old pipes have been left vulnerable to extreme cold snaps, despite decades of warnings by engineers and climate scientists.

The lack of weatherization, winterization and modernization of such essential utilities negatively impacted 4.5 million Texans during the deep-freeze, which essentially crippled Texas‚Äôs electric grid and water systems, leaving said millions bereft of heat or drinkable water. Like many cities in Texas, pipes in Jackson city were bursting, leaving behind millions in damages.

Mississippi is the most impoverished state in the country with a poverty rate of 19.7 percent, according to an annual report by the U S News & World Report. The state also ranks among the most publicly underfunded in regard to hospital, schools and various public services. The state‚Äôs median income is $23,121, well below the national median income of $33,706. Moreover, out of the 50 states, Mississippi ranks 50th in health care, 48th in economy, 46th in education, 45th in infrastructure and 44th in fiscal stability.

Jackson‚Äôs Democratic mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, estimated that modernization of the city‚Äôs water infrastructure would cost around $2 billion. Last week, he asked Republican Governor Tate Reeves for just $47 million for repairs to the city‚Äôs derelict water system.

Reeves, declaring a state of emergency, called in the National Guard last month to aid in the distribution of water, proposing the possibility of the state assuming control over the city‚Äôs water supply. Reeves‚Äô chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor‚Äôs office was helping the city to secure low-interest state loans to pay for modernization of its water system. White also made mention of Lumumba‚Äôs meeting with members of the Republican-dominated state legislature, including Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding for the city.

In an interview last week, Lumumba stated that he hopes to push both state and city officials in the direction of ‚Äúa long-term solution.‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a saying that you should allow no crisis to go to waste.‚Äù He continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crises like these that really allow us to take stock of conditions of where we are as a city, where we are as a state and hopefully it allows us to build the resolve to address it.‚Äù

However, with no significant action after then-Mayor Tony Yarber issued a state of emergency related to the city‚Äôs water and road infrastructure problems in 2015, residents can expect much of the same this time around. Bogus fixes, such as the fraudulently installed Siemens water meters, which cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars and contributed to a water service shutoff crisis, are certainly in the offing.

In an interview with the New York Times, Carolyn Willis, an elderly Jackson resident, reflecting on the crisis, said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt bathe. You can‚Äôt wash.‚Äù This has increased the danger posed by the COVID-19 pandemic with sanitation, including frequent hand washing, being of the utmost importance. Mississippi has recorded 301,000 cases of coronavirus and 6,901 deaths. Jackson accounts for 19,287 cases and 397 deaths.

The conditions Jackson‚Äôs residents have been subjected to are a reflection of the malign neglect of state and federal governments. The trillions of dollars which are needed to fix the United States‚Äô crumbling infrastructure must be expropriated from the banks and corporations and placed under the democratic control of the working class. Only with the banks and utilities placed under the common ownership and operation of workers themselves can a rational plan be worked out to prevent future catastrophes and make those who have suffered from the latest disaster whole.","The water supply in Jackson, Mississippi remains largely unusable by residents a month after a historic winter storm swept through the Southern United States.

His family hunkered down with a generator, and the reserve of water they‚Äôd bought in preparation for the winter storm. By the end of the week, the ice had thawed. But when they checked the faucet, nothing came out.

For much of the city, it stayed that way for three weeks. And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city‚Äôs water service had been restored, the crisis isn‚Äôt over.

At the Global Connection Learning Center, a day care serving 59 children, there‚Äôs still tape over the sinks to make sure children don‚Äôt use them, as much of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice. Staff members wash the toddlers‚Äô hands and the center's dishes with bottled water instead. Nancy Sylvester, the center‚Äôs director, takes bibs and cot covers to her home in nearby Clinton to launder them.

At the height of the crisis, at least 40,000 residents in Jackson and neighboring Byram were estimated to have lost water service. While locals are no longer melting snow or collecting rainwater in buckets to have the ability to flush toilets, officials have not yet been able to prove that most of the city‚Äôs water is safe to drink. For many residents, frequenting water giveaways has become a part of their daily routine.

Life these days is about ‚Äújust getting water and trying to make it work,‚Äù said south Jackson resident Alonzo Mabry, who has been scouring the city for free bottled water for his 94-year-old mother, who is bedridden.

Officials hope to begin lifting the boil-water notice by next week, but challenges remain. Absent an overhaul of what Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba has called ‚Äúpeanut brittle‚Äù-like infrastructure, and the hundreds of millions of dollars to make it happen, the threat of the next outage looms.

Although previous cold snaps have caused water main breaks, locals say this year‚Äôs outage is one of the worst in recent history. Danyelle Holmes, a field director with the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign and a Jackson resident, spent much of the past month helping distribute water in the city. She‚Äôd seen commercials by international charities showing families and young children filling up buckets and jugs with water. Now this was happening at home.

Holmes is not surprised that the infrastructure in a city where some of the pipes predate the Great Depression ‚Äúwent sour.‚Äù

Syndication: The Clarion-Ledger (Barbara Gauntt / Clarion Ledger via USA Today Network)

Jackson is a city with an estimated $2 billion infrastructure problem ‚Äî the cost of overdue water and sewer overhauls ‚Äî and a $300 million annual budget. Twenty-five percent of residents in Jackson live below the poverty line. The city‚Äôs median income is just below $39,000. Although it‚Äôs Mississippi‚Äôs largest city, Jackson, where 82 percent of residents are Black, has struggled. Decades of white flight have whittled down the city‚Äôs economic footing.

‚ÄúAll of this happened to individuals at no fault of their own and yet they have to suffer,‚Äù she said.

For years, the city has struggled to collect overdue water bills from residents, while locals have reported receiving astronomical bills of $1,000 or more. In 2014, voters approved an additional 1 percent sales tax to make improvements. That‚Äôs brought the city $13 million to $15 million a year for improvements, but it still falls short.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday that his top priority is making sure residents have safe running water again. But he‚Äôs also spent time lobbying for funding from the state that could help prevent future crises.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not done yet,‚Äù he said.

The city‚Äôs latest chapter in a long history of infrastructure woes started Feb. 15, when a winter storm pummeled Mississippi and much of the South.

In Jackson, critical machinery froze at the city‚Äôs water plant. A precipitous drop in water pressure followed, further taxing the city‚Äôs water supply as residents kept their faucets dripping in an attempt to prevent pipes from freezing. The gradual return of pressure as temperatures warmed up proved too much for Jackson‚Äôs system to handle. Nearly 100 confirmed water breaks in the city followed, creating another setback in efforts to restore water supply.

A coalition of grassroots groups formed a rapid response team to supply water to residents. Organizers also provided cash assistance to locals who had missed work because of the storm or struggled to replace groceries that spoiled when the electricity went out.

Natt Offiah, a volunteer for the effort, monitored the group‚Äôs hotline. One woman who called over several days for help was incredulous when she learned the group wasn‚Äôt part of a government-led response. Pipes had burst in her home and she was desperate for assistance to stay in a hotel. As the group worked to collect donations to put her up, she told Offiah she‚Äôd never heard of a state or federal agency using methods like Cash App to deliver relief funds. She asked if they were a scam.

‚ÄúI thought this was the government. Do you know if the state is doing anything?‚Äù she asked Offiah.

Almost a week would pass before the National Guard arrived to distribute water.

‚ÄúRight now, we all we got,‚Äù Offiah told her, recalling that ‚Äúher mood changed from anger to frustration to a bit of shock. The disappointment was pointed toward the lack of state response.‚Äù

Bailey Martin, a spokeswoman for Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves‚Äô office, said the governor had fulfilled several requests made by Hinds County, where Jackson is located, including for water delivery. Reeves, a Republican, signed an executive order on Feb. 23 to deploy the National Guard once local officials made the request, Martin said. Members arrived with four tanker trucks the next day.

She added that Reeves ""couldn't be more proud"" of the work the National Guard and the state's emergency management agency have done over the past 13 months.

Before the recent storm, many residents say a deep freeze in 2018 was a warning shot. Frigid temperatures caused a streak of water main breaks, leaving some locals without water for the week. The event also shut down the city‚Äôs schools for several days. Many of the district‚Äôs campuses lacked enough water pressure to flush toilets or heat up buildings.

That same month, the city council signaled their support for potential litigation against a private company charged with upgrading the city's water billing system, resulting in an eventual settlement in 2020. Jackson received about $60 million in funds, but steep expenses remain. The past few weeks have further exposed the fragility of the city‚Äôs water system.

As crews worked to restore service, Lumumba and the city‚Äôs legislative delegation began lobbying top officials in the state for a reprieve. Lumumba drafted a letter to the state‚Äôs Republican leadership and the congressional delegation, requesting $47 million in aid.

Another option, introduced by state Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, would allow the city to bring another tax increase before voters for repairs. But the legislation must pass both chambers and cross Reeves' desk before becoming law. As the April 4 end date of the legislative session approaches, it‚Äôs unclear if lawmakers will take action.

The city has submitted a damage assessment of $16 million in hopes of securing federal relief. Michelle Atoa, a spokeswoman for the mayor‚Äôs office, said officials anticipate sending a supplemental request as further costs are determined.

Williams expressed hope Thursday that funds from the latest Covid-19 relief package recently signed by President Joe Biden would trickle down to Jackson and provide a start.

In the meantime, some residents, like Holmes, aren‚Äôt waiting for a solution to be sketched out. Climate change that has pushed hotter summers and harsher winters in the region, she said, means the city‚Äôs system will be hit again. She‚Äôs already discussing with organizers how to prepare for the next one.

‚ÄúWe can never say, ‚Äòwe won‚Äôt see this day again,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe know the next time we experience this, it will be worse.‚Äù","And although Jackson announced Friday that most of the city‚Äôs water service had been restored, the crisis isn‚Äôt over.

28,2021-03-18 14:18:00+00:00,Without Water in Jackson,"About this episode:

It‚Äôs been a month since an historic winter storm hit Jackson, Mississippi, leaving tens of thousands of residents without clean water, or without any water at all. Most of those residents were Black. Four weeks later, much of the capital city still has to boil water to drink.

Eighty-two percent of the residents in Jackson are Black and nearly a third live in poverty. Over the past several decades, the city has not had enough money to fix its dilapidated water system.

State lawmakers, whose leadership has always been white, are debating how to address the water crisis before the end of the legislative session in just a few weeks; historically, state leaders have insisted that Jackson‚Äôs water problems are the city‚Äôs fault, and the city‚Äôs to fix.

Many residents, including Jackson‚Äôs mayor, say race and racism play a big part in the struggle over the decades-long water crisis in Jackson. If the city were majority-white, they say, this problem would have been fixed a long time ago.

Host Trymaine Lee speaks with West Jackson resident Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of Mississippi Black Women‚Äôs Roundtable and an advocate for Black women and girls in the state.

And Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba discusses the problem from his vantage point as the man in charge of the water crisis and the chief advocate for more money from the state to fix the crumbling system.

29,,"Weeks After Winter Storms, Mississippi City Still Grappling With Water Crisis","JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI - Officials in Mississippi's largest city, Jackson, are aiming to have running water largely restored by the weekend, nearly three weeks after devastating winter weather left tens of thousands of residents without service.

The city was again distributing non-potable water Friday at four sites so people can flush their toilets, and residents must still boil any faucet water before using it for food preparation, drinking, washing dishes or brushing teeth.

Charles Williams, the city's public works director, said Thursday that workers should soon be able to sample enough water to lift the boil advisory.

""I see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Williams said at a news conference, sounding more optimistic than he did Wednesday, when problems at the city's treatment plant caused pressure to drop across the entire system. At that time, he estimated that about a quarter of Jackson's 43,000 water connections ‚Äî most of which serve multiple households ‚Äî were not operating.

Ben Mitchell and Deon Sanders work at a public water distribution site after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, in Jackson, Mississippi, March 4, 2021.

Officials did not have an updated estimate as of Friday, though city spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the system was able maintain pressure overnight.

Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water to perform the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.

She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. Her husband's uncle, however, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.

""It was very stressful,"" said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ""third-world country.""

The problems stem from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down the state's power grid and leaving millions without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.

Jackson, the state capital with a population of more than 160,000 people, has seen more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said.

The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves earlier this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson's water system.

Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children finally had water service return Thursday after more than two weeks without it. ""I was like, 'Oh Lord,'"" she said with relief.

Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.

The crisis has also shuttered businesses across the city.

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie's New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint, would open Friday for the first time since February 17 after getting water restored Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Bakery & Cafe, meanwhile, were spending all day on Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening Saturday morning.

30,2021-02-25 12:00:00-05:00,Water problems across the South: Blame it on decades-old pipes,"The sunshine is back and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their citizens.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region's water mains, froze equipment, and left millions without service, it‚Äôs clear just how much work needs to be done.

Families stood for hours in lines to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realize how much you use water until you don‚Äôt have it,‚Äù said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described ‚Äúchronic, long-term and insufficient investment.‚Äù The report warned that the ‚Äúnation‚Äôs public health and the economy will be at risk.""

Actually, it's already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents in the city of 650,000 have been told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they plan to use it for drinking, cooking, or brushing their teeth. More than 40,000 Louisianans still had water outages Wednesday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are ‚Äúnon-operational,‚Äù affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation's fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already-struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi‚Äôs majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson‚Äôs water problem a public health crisis.

‚ÄúThe wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,‚Äù the retired public works department employee said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not their concern because they don‚Äôt live here no more.‚Äù

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

‚ÄúThese pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they‚Äôll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.‚Äù

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets, and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, while collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

‚ÄúThe vulnerable are left behind,‚Äù she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to ‚Äúold, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.‚Äù

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins‚Äô bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants was being done, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city‚Äôs 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.

31,3/4/2021 0:00,‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no excuse for this‚Äô: thousands in Mississippi city still without water weeks after storms,"As the sound of rainwater droplets crescendoed around him, Rodrick Readus stood by his front door and took a moment to reflect on the many indignities of the past fortnight.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the simple fact you can‚Äôt wash your hands,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt take a bath. Every time I touch something I know I‚Äôm not clean.‚Äù

Like every other resident in his two-story apartment complex, Readus has been without running water since mid-February, when Jackson, Mississippi‚Äôs state capital, was lashed by two back-to-back winter storms. They crippled the city‚Äôs ailing water infrastructure and left thousands of residents now entering their third week without flowing pipes. While most national and international attention has focused on the aftermath of the storms in Texas, Mississippi has been largely ignored.

Buckets, jugs, bottles and plastic trays litter the ground outside Readus‚Äôs apartment complex, many are perched under gutters to capture the rainwater before it disperses into the mud. It‚Äôs the water he uses to flush his toilet.

The 47-year-old self-employed home repairman has no car, meaning he relies on family members and neighbours to drop off small containers of non-potable water to wash his dishes, which are piling up in the sink. He has already spent a few hundred dollars on bottled water to drink, an amount he simply cannot afford.

‚ÄúWe are all citizens and there‚Äôs no excuse for this,‚Äù Readus said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt treat us as second class because we don‚Äôt have the things that others do.‚Äù

The winter storms, which crippled power sources throughout the US south, brought record low temperatures to parts of Mississippi. In Jackson, where 80% of residents are Black, the cold led to at least 96 breakages in the city‚Äôs ageing pipes, which, combined with power outages, lead to catastrophically low pressure throughout its water system. As of Monday evening 35 breakages remained, and although pressure was slowly coming back, thousands of residents are without water. Most of them in the city‚Äôs south, which sits on higher ground and is furthest away from the treatment plant. A citywide boil notice remains in effect and officials have offered no timeline for full restoration.

K‚ÄôAcia Drummer, a 27 year-old middle school teacher, also lives in south Jackson. She tried in vain to stick it out at her apartment after the ice receded last month, but with no running water and the increasing cost ($40 a day) of purchasing bottled water, she elected to leave and stay with friends. She returned home on Tuesday hoping to see her water restored but felt a sinking feeling as the taps dribbled an insignificant stream and her toilet still wouldn‚Äôt fill.

‚ÄúI feel displaced,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow I know what it feels like to live without basic necessities, and it‚Äôs one of those things that puts you in a different place mentally. My anxiety has been through the roof.‚Äù

With no shower water, she plans to bathe at her gym. With no functioning toilet, she has decided to ‚Äútake in less fluids‚Äù.

Jackson‚Äôs mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, has said the city requires $2bn to revitalize its ailing piping and treatment system. He compared the city‚Äôs pipes to peanut brittle, explaining that as repair crews move in to fix the pipes, one repair can lead to another breakage.

Mississippi, American‚Äôs poorest state, has long faced chronic infrastructure problems. A 2020 report card published by the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the state a D+ grade, noting decaying systems across roads, energy, solid waste and a host of other essential services. On its drinking water systems, the report noted some were losing as much as 50% of treated water due to breakages and that certain systems were still dependent on pipes laid in the 1920s. ‚ÄúMany of these networks have aged past their useful life span,‚Äù the report notes.

But at a press conference on Monday, Mayor Lumumba made clear that the changing climate was exacerbating the issue.

‚ÄúOne thing that is clear is that our winters are colder, our summers are hotter and the rain we experience is more abundant,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the city‚Äôs outdoor water treatment facility was simply not built to endure the cold. ‚ÄúAnd so not only do we need this investment because of the ageing infrastructure we need this investment because of the increased pressure that these extreme weather conditions are taking.‚Äù

Jackson is far from unique, as Texas‚Äôs widespread power outages last month revealed, but with systems across the US faltering under the climate crisis, experts predict these catastrophic events are likely to become more and more frequent.

‚ÄúThe climate is changing. Infrastructure is ageing. Funding for updating infrastructure is decreasing. And we as a society do not like thinking about paying for infrastructure, we only typically do when there is something as dramatic as the Flint water crisis or hurricane Katrina,‚Äù said Professor Martin Doyle, a director of the water policy program at Duke University.

In Jackson, the city has moved to raise sales taxes in order to pay for water and sewage upgrades in the wake of the crisis, but Mayor Lumumba made clear on Monday he believed the federal government should also be offering financial assistance.

Doyle points out that until the 1980s the federal government was a major source of water infrastructure funding, which was ‚Äúlargely taken away ‚Ä¶ so cities and utilities are now on their own financially and they are having to figure it out‚Äù.

The issue was the subject of a major investigation by the Guardian last year.

At the Forest Hill high school in south Jackson a steady stream of residents queued for non-potable water being distributed by national guard troops on Tuesday morning. Residents came with buckets, milk bottles, bins and tankers, anything to bring home as many gallons as possible.

Many did not want to talk during what was an intimate, and for some almost humiliating, moment of need.

But Cedric Weeks, a local restaurant owner who had been forced to temporarily close his business, took a moment to reflect.

‚ÄúI saw [the water crisis in] Flint and I didn‚Äôt flinch at it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut to be in that predicament now. I see the major need of water. I‚Äôve never lived without it. So to have to haul it and to have to flush toilets and take baths with what you hauled ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs terrible, you know.‚Äù

It was something one of the troops themselves could relate to.

Specialist Christopher Shannon, out to assist residents and media with queries about the operation, had also been living without water for two weeks. ‚ÄúYou hate to see people struggle, but we love to come out and help,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNo one expected it. Nothing is built for winter out here ‚Ä¶ You can prepare all you want, but if you‚Äôre not built for it, you‚Äôre not built for it.‚Äù","They crippled the city‚Äôs ailing water infrastructure and left thousands of residents now entering their third week without flowing pipes.

Interview Highlights

What happened to the water supply in Jackson, Mississippi?

Donna Ladd: ‚ÄúTo use words that my reporter Nick Judin used, it‚Äôs a complex system collapse. And when we say that, it‚Äôs not just the technological part of the system. It‚Äôs the fact that we‚Äôve known this for years, it‚Äôs coming in one way or another. I mean, we know it. There was a big 2013 study that warned about all of these things. So we know the conditions of them. But there‚Äôs a systemic breakdown in the willingness to actually do something about it.

‚ÄúAnd the city itself, because, like so many cities in the U.S., because of flight, and disinvestment and losing the tax base. And in this case, losing 40,000 residents, taking us from 200,000 to 160,000. But we still have a huge land mass of city with these outdated pipes under them. So we can‚Äôt pay, we can‚Äôt afford to keep it up. ‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a systemic breakdown of federal, state and local municipal areas being able to work together to solve problems together on basic things like infrastructure.‚Äù

What has the city of Jackson done over the past couple of decades to attend to this known problem?

Donna Ladd: ‚ÄúI think the best way to break it down is to say staunching the bleeding, Band-Aid approach as far as the city itself is concerned. I mean, I can‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ sit here and blame a city that is as beleaguered as our city has been for not having the resources to be able to overhaul the water system.

‚ÄúSome of the numbers that we‚Äôve come up with, the least amount that they need is $600 million. And then, as you said earlier, it keeps climbing from there. I mean, if the money‚Äôs not here, the money‚Äôs not here. So what that means is that the state should be at the same table with the city, side by side. This is the capital city.

‚ÄúYou know, the state is no stronger than its capital city. That‚Äôs absurd. And so they should be side by side with the city saying, OK, how are we going to work together to get federal help? What is it that we can do? How can we help? But the opposite happens. You know, one of the things our governor said just recently was, Well, you know, Jackson residents should pay their water bill, so they should go collect the water bill.

‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs a whole issue around faulty billing that we‚Äôve been through. But beyond that, it‚Äôs like the city tried to get the state, and the state legislature passed legislation to allow payment plans for the water bill. And the governor vetoed it last year. And so that‚Äôs like working against us, and so the money doesn‚Äôt come in. But the water billing money is not enough to pay for what we‚Äôre talking about here.‚Äù

We keep using this phrase ‚Äòcrumbling.‚Äô Is that a fair description of some of these water systems?

Aaron Packman: ‚ÄúMost of the infrastructure we have in the eastern half of the United States is quite old. Just for point of comparison, I live in Chicago. We‚Äôre still using the water intakes from Lake Michigan that were built in the 1960s. And in places like Philadelphia, the water infrastructure goes back 300 years. So clearly infrastructure that age needs a lot of maintenance to work properly. And it‚Äôs very hard to do, because most of the pipes are underground and inaccessible. So we definitely have an issue with its aging, deteriorating water infrastructure in a lot of the country.‚Äù

35,,"As Jackson residents suffer during historic water crisis, state leaders keep their distance","Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann is one of the most powerful residents of Jackson, where about 40,000 of his neighbors ‚Äî mostly Black ‚Äî are in their third week without running water after a historic winter storm froze plant equipment and burst many water pipes.

The ongoing water crisis is the result of decades of inaction from city leaders, who put off routine maintenance and meaningful infrastructure repairs as the city‚Äôs tax base and revenue collections diminished. Current and former city leaders, having dealt for decades with aging and brittle pipes, say they need investment from the state and federal government.

Many are placing their hope for financial support from the state with Hosemann, who lives in northeast Jackson and wields significant control of the state‚Äôs purse strings. He was asked this week about whether the state should step in and help.

‚ÄúIf you remember during Kane Ditto‚Äôs administration, he did repair work on water and sewer,‚Äù Hosemann responded, referring to the last white Jackson mayor who left office in 1997. ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs happened since then? The prime mover (of solving the problem) needs to be the city itself. Those people have to come up with a reasonable plan to get their water bills out on time.‚Äù

Hosemann continued: ‚ÄúWhere do you start? What are the most complicated places? What‚Äôs your plan to do that? How much money is it going to take, and how do you even pay for it? I haven‚Äôt seen any of that. Clearly, it‚Äôs not the state. The city is the city of Jackson. It elects its mayor, it elects its city councilmen. And those people need to come up with a plan.‚Äù

With his answer, Hosemann joined a decades-long chorus of statewide elected officials who misrepresent the causes of Jackson‚Äôs infrastructure problems and are reluctant to offer long-term solutions. Mississippi Today spoke with several of the state‚Äôs top leaders this week about the current water crisis, and all of them echoed similar sentiments.

Jackson, the state‚Äôs largest city, is at least 80% Black. Statewide elected officials are white; the state of Mississippi has never elected a Black statewide official, and legislative leaders who control the state‚Äôs budget are white. Most of the city‚Äôs white residents like Hosemann, because of more recent infrastructure upgrades in northeast Jackson and their proximity to water treatment plants, rarely experience long-term outages.

Meanwhile, residents in south and west Jackson, majority-Black areas of the city, take the brunt of the city‚Äôs infrastructure failings. And because of careful legislative gerrymandering and segregated politics, Black elected officials at the Capitol have little influence over the budget process or other major policy negotiations.

Now 17 days since Jackson‚Äôs current water crisis began, an estimated 11,000 households, or around 40,000 people, are still without running water. City officials cannot say definitively when water service will be restored. At least 80 water main breaks and leaks have been reported across the city, and the entire city remains under a boil water notice. Crews completing the repairs have described city pipes, some over 100 years old, as brittle, underscoring the need for a vast overhaul of the city‚Äôs aging infrastructure.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has estimated a complete water and sewer replacement project would cost around $2 billion, more than six times the city‚Äôs annual budget. On Wednesday, Lumumba wrote a letter to state and federal leaders asking for an emergency appropriation of $47 million to make necessary repairs to solve this current crisis.

‚ÄúThe city of Jackson, like most cities, is under-resourced and not capable of making these corrections based on our own budgetary ability,‚Äù Lumumba said during a Wednesday night interview on MSNBC.

Even after water service is restored to the whole city, future crises of this magnitude are all but certain without that overhaul. The years of dedicated investment and work this would take are more than any city could handle on its own, especially one with a gutted tax base ‚Äî due in large part to outmigration of white residents and business owners who began leaving the city in the 1980s.

Ditto, the city‚Äôs last white mayor that Hosemann referenced this week, struggled mightily to maintain the aged infrastructure his white predecessors failed to maintain. One of the worst water crises during Ditto‚Äôs tenure as mayor was in 1989, when thousands of the city‚Äôs residents were without water on Christmas Day after record low temperatures burst pipes. Hosemann‚Äôs comments about Ditto‚Äôs tenure have been sharply critiqued in many circles this week.

‚ÄúI was disappointed that we have leaders in our community who are spreading this kind of misinformation,‚Äù Harvey Johnson, Jackson‚Äôs first Black mayor who succeeded Ditto in 1997, said of Hosemann‚Äôs comments. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a criticism that was misplaced and unfounded. It just perpetuates, in my opinion, this whole notion that Jackson, as a Black city that has Black leadership, can‚Äôt do anything themselves. That‚Äôs the furthest thing from the truth, and I take offense to that. I‚Äôve been in the venues of public service for 40 years, and have prepared myself to deal with the problems of local government and how to address those problems.

Johnson continued: ‚ÄúFor someone (Hosemann) who has a limited perspective on that, I just take exception when they start spouting out those things.‚Äù

And while many scoff at providing state assistance, leaders in the city acknowledge they can‚Äôt rebuild their infrastructure without that help. As the state‚Äôs largest and capital city, anchoring the only true metropolitan area of the state, Jackson‚Äôs problems are the state‚Äôs problems, they argue.

‚ÄúState leaders need to understand the importance of the city of Jackson when it comes to the growth of our state in economic development, education, healthcare and other business opportunities,‚Äù said state Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson. ‚ÄúJackson is the tree trunk, and the rest of the state are the branches. If the trunk dies, the branches die. So we need to make a concerted effort to make sure the roots are healthy and strong.‚Äù

With no long-term solution in sight, Jackson residents continue to suffer and national news crews descend upon the city to cover the crisis. Meanwhile, state leaders continue to put the impetus on the city to fix its own problems. Top leaders interviewed by Mississippi Today this week said they haven‚Äôt heard from city leaders directly about the notion of helping, and some expressed concern about stepping in without an ask.

‚ÄúDo you interfere when you are not asked to? That could be not taken well by some if you do,‚Äù Rep. Trey Lamar, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Mississippi Today.

In terms of state funding, Lamar said there could be opportunities to help the city, ‚Äúbut that depends on what the definition of help is.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any appetite to help Jackson in the form of a handout,‚Äù Lamar said. ‚ÄúNumber one, we need to be shown proof that the city is incapable of fixing this problem on their own. I don‚Äôt know that legislative support would be there for a handout, but there might be other ways the state could help ensure the work is done if the city were financially responsible for it with the state‚Äôs help.‚Äù

Gov. Tate Reeves, while answering questions about Jackson‚Äôs water crisis on Feb. 23, bluntly reminded listeners that the state doesn‚Äôt run Jackson‚Äôs water system but vaguely added, ‚ÄúPerhaps we should.‚Äù The governor hasn‚Äôt acknowledged that comment or the possibility of a state takeover since, and his office has not answered several follow-up questions about it from Mississippi Today.

But during a press conference on Tuesday, Reeves said that ‚Äúmost things should be on the table‚Äù when asked if he supported a proposal that would allow the city of Jackson to increase its sales tax by 1% to pay for infrastructure repairs. Then he quickly pivoted to the city‚Äôs water billing woes.

‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money,‚Äù Reeves said. ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs been a long standing challenge for the city. I think they will admit that. Clearly their billing system is flawed at best.‚Äù

The governor is correct about the city‚Äôs water billing challenges. In 2012, the city signed a $91 million contract with Siemens, an international company renowned for its work on municipal water and sewer systems. The contract, the largest in city history, included the installation of new water meters and a modern billing system.

But that contract turned out to be one of the biggest failures in the company‚Äôs and city‚Äôs history. Siemens failed to deliver on its promises, which led to widespread billing issues and thousands of faulty water meters. Many Jackson residents received inaccurate bills, while others stopped getting billed at all. This left the city with a deficit of around $2 million each month in water collections revenue, and the billing problems continue today.

The city filed a lawsuit against Siemens in June 2019, eventually seeking $450 million in damages. The two parties reached a $89.8 million settlement in March 2020, but that didn‚Äôt erase the systemic problems Siemens left behind or recoup the hundreds of millions in water revenue the city lost.

Doing what little they can with limited resources, Jackson‚Äôs city council on Tuesday approved a proposal for the 1% sales tax increase to help pay for water and sewage system improvements. That local tax increase requires approval from the Mississippi Legislature, which is controlled by Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn, a resident of Clinton.

If the proposal receives legislative approval, it will be placed on a ballot referendum for Jackson residents. However, even if the water tax gets the go-ahead, it would take nearly 143 years for it to generate enough revenue to fund the much-needed water and sewer improvements.

Though lawmakers have long been apprehensive to work with the city, they have passed several measures in recent years to help solve some of the city‚Äôs problems. Lawmakers signed off on a one-cent sales tax increase in 2014, giving Jackson new revenue that no other Mississippi city has for infrastructure repairs. The tax has generated around $14 million each year in additional tax revenue. But city leaders, who have opted to spend that additional revenue on less expensive road repairs and repaving instead of replacing pipes beneath the streets, have been criticized for their handling of those funds.

Lawmakers also created the Capitol Complex Improvement District in 2017, which diverted sales tax revenue to fund new infrastructure fixes in Jackson. The aim of the legislation was for the state to pay its fair share for repairs in areas of the city where the state has offices and conducts business.

‚ÄúI think everybody is frustrated with the city‚Äôs plight,‚Äù said state Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson who worked with state leaders on the 1% sales tax and the Capitol Complex District legislation. ‚ÄúThe people who live here are. The people who visit are. Legislators are frustrated. They don‚Äôt have confidence in much of the city‚Äôs elected leadership. That makes them reluctant to help the city.‚Äù

Horhn, who has run unsuccessfully for Jackson mayor several times, said the state‚Äôs elected leaders have a long-standing ‚Äúlove-hate relationship‚Äù with the city, inspired by decades of neglecting the infrastructure system.

‚ÄúPart of it is urban-rural. There is a racial overtone,‚Äù Horhn said. ‚ÄúThere is a sense that the quality of leadership in the capital city is the reason for the problems. A lot of people (at the Capitol) have lost confidence in the elected leadership in Jackson.‚Äù

During his interview on Monday, Hosemann launched into an aside, unprompted, about crime in the city of Jackson. While the city saw a historic high in homicides in 2020, white politicians have a long history of exploiting the city‚Äôs crime struggles when brushing off calls to help the city.

Hosemann argued that the Legislature is already shouldering undue burdens from the city of Jackson and Hinds County, citing a pending Senate bill that would give Capitol Police jurisdiction over the parts of Jackson and federal CARES Act funds spent on the Hinds County court system. Four special judges were appointed in July to help try the backlog of Hinds County cases that built up during the early months of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThey have cases going back to 1997,‚Äù Hosemann said of the Hinds County courts, which hear cases from outside the city of Jackson. ‚ÄúPeople are not getting tried, and people are dying. There‚Äôs murder in the streets here.‚Äù

Eventually circling back to the water crisis, Hosemann downplayed any notion of the state stepping in.

‚ÄúThe Legislature is doing its part, we‚Äôre doing stuff every day to help our capital city,‚Äù Hosemann said. ‚ÄúI live here, my children live here, my grandchildren live here. Some of this, they need to get their water bills out. I will tell you that there are a myriad of problems. To answer your question, no one has contacted us about taking over Jackson‚Äôs water.‚Äù

36,,"Why Jackson, Mississippi‚Äôs Forgotten Water Crisis is America‚Äôs Problem ‚Äî Next Generation Politics","When a devastating winter storm barreled through the South last month, Americans became transfixed by the plight of Texas where subfreezing temperatures and record snowfall paralyzed the power grid causing surprise power outages, sky-high electricity bills, and widespread chaos. But while the national news remained focused on images of the Lone Star State uncharacteristically blanketed in snow, a no less dire but far less publicized crisis was taking place in Mississippi.





For more than a month now, residents of Mississippi‚Äôs capital Jackson have faced severe water shortages caused by the same back-to-back winter storms that rocked Texas. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumamba told PBS NewsHour: ‚ÄúJackson's infrastructure is in a dire state. It is an aged legacy city, where one of our plants is literally more than 100 years old. Another one is outdated, and so we are in need of several repairs because we face more extreme weather conditions today.‚Äù The storm plunged thousands of locals into the cold and dark: the roads covered in black ice and many houses left without power. But unlike most of Texas, which had the public funds to quickly return to normalcy, water treatment plants in Jackson have not operated since Feb. 15. Due to freezing temperatures, water pressure across the whole city dropped to below functional levels. Further, Jackson reported ‚Äú96 main water breaks,‚Äù the mayor's office said a statement.





State representative Ronnie Crudup says at least 40,000 residents currently have no access to clean water even while the National Guard has been called in to distribute non-potable water, which can be used to flush toilets but isn‚Äôt clean enough to drink or cook with. ‚ÄúWe can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry,"" Crudup said. ‚ÄúIt's tremendously difficult.‚Äù By contrast, Texas‚Äô capital Austin quickly came back online with water and electrical services restored to operational levels within a week of the heavy winter weather.





Beyond simply exposing the vulnerabilities of Jackson‚Äôs decaying infrastructure, the historic storm highlighted what some community activists see as a more nefarious dynamic in play. Cassandra Welchlin, co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and executive director of the Mississippi Black Women‚Äôs Roundtable, for one, feels that race has played a crucial but under-examined role in what she terms a ‚Äúbreakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens.‚Äù





""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people,"" Welchlin says, pointing out that Jackson's population is more than 80 % Black. The mayor acknowledged the intersection between racial and financial struggles, which are only exacerbated during times of need. ‚ÄúI think that if we're honest with ourselves, we have to recognize the role that that plays. Often, we're a bit skittish of having those conversations. But we have to realize that issues of race are as American as apple pie,‚Äù Lumamba said.

Moreover, as Welchlin sees it, the local government has ignored Jackson's outdated systems for decades, placing numerous additional financial strains on people already reeling from the storm‚Äôs effects. ‚ÄúAll of this is interconnected,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBecause of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have an internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see.""

Mayor Lumamba estimates that the city needs $2 billion in repairs, comparing the hundred-year-old pipes to peanut brittle. Some city officials have proposed increasing the sales taxes in order to pay for water and sewage upgrades in the wake of the crisis. But the mayor made clear that he believes the federal government should extend emergency financial assistance, particularly with Mississippi ranking as the poorest state. As of 2020, nearly one-fifth of Mississippi's total population have incomes below the poverty line according to Talk Poverty.

Rodrick Readus, 47, is the living embodiment of how crumbling public infrastructure and the misallocation of government resources can cost people their livelihoods. A home repairman living in Jackson, he‚Äôs self-employed and doesn‚Äôt own a car, making navigating the storm‚Äôs aftermath that much more difficult. He has depended on family and neighbors to provide him with potable water, and his budget for bottled water has diminished with his loss of income. ‚ÄúWe are all citizens and there‚Äôs no excuse for this,‚Äù Readus said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt treat us as second class because we don‚Äôt have the things that others do.‚Äù

At a press conference on Monday, Mayor Lumamba put a fine point on how global warming may also be exacerbating the problems of Jackson‚Äôs populace. ‚ÄúOne thing that is clear is that our winters are colder, our summers are hotter and the rain we experience is more abundant,‚Äù he said, pointing out that the city‚Äôs outdoor water treatment facility was simply not built to endure the cold. ‚ÄúAnd so not only do we need this investment because of the aging infrastructure, we need this investment because of the increased pressure that these extreme weather conditions are taking.‚Äù

It is a fact that climate change will only get worse unless there are sweeping initiatives enacted to improve the environment. It is a fact that a crumbling city infrastructure like that of Jackson, Mississippi will continue to cause death and deprivation unless state and federal governments step in to give people the resources they need to improve it. For a city like Jackson, which is overwhelmingly underprepared, when these problems hit, it is much harder for them to bounce back.

About 40,000 residents in Jackson, Mississippi have been without water for weeks after freezing temperatures impacted the aging water system.

More than 80% of the city‚Äôs residents are Black and those who can get water are being told to boil it before use.

Mississippi State Representative Ronnie Crudup Jr. joined BNC‚Äôs Start Your Day with Sharon Reed and Mike Hill to provide an update on the crisis.

Crudup says residents are approaching their third week without water.

After getting a small amount of water restored, residents experienced another setback on Wednesday when equipment at the water treatment plant broke and water pressure decreased again.

‚ÄúWe thought we were kind of seeing the end of this, but we don‚Äôt know at this current moment,‚Äù Crudup said.

Churches have been providing residents with bottled water to help them eat, drink, cook, shower and flush toilets.

Crudup says South Jackson and West Jackson are the impacted areas and his family has been affected personally by the disaster.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have running water as well. So we‚Äôve been having to go and rent hotel rooms to go and shower,‚Äù he said.

Crudup also said it‚Äôs been tough with his children doing virtual learning.

The state representative said that Jackson‚Äôs again water system has been an issue that‚Äôs been going on for a long time.

‚ÄúThe city has been trying to address this thing for over 10 years,‚Äù he said.

In 2012, the city of Jackson hired Siemens to update the water system as part of a $91 million project.

The contract led to widespread billing issues what was called ‚Äúa bait and switch scheme.‚Äù

In 2019, the city sued Siemens and several subcontractors for the failure.

Crudup says the polar vortex that brought freezing water to the area is one of the main reasons the system finally failed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve never had a freeze that hard for more than five straight days,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt basically shut down our water treatment facility, so we need to weatherize that.‚Äù

According to Crudup, the city needs a comprehensive plan to address the issue to prevent it from happening again.

Right now, Calandra Davis‚Äô water pressure is too low to take a shower. When she turns on her sinks, the water comes out at a slow trickle. For weeks, she‚Äôs had to bathe herself and her 6-year-old son with water from store-bought bottles. Like all residents of Jackson, Mississippi, she‚Äôs also been on a boil-water notice for a week due to high turbidity. But in many ways, she feels lucky.

‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm privileged in that I have water at all right now and in that I didn‚Äôt go super long without water,‚Äù she said. Unlike more than 50,000 people in her city, she also didn‚Äôt lose power.

Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute and organizer with the social justice organization Black Youth Project 100, has been spending hours each day on mutual aid efforts, delivering food and water, and helping get those without utilities into hotel rooms. While working a local emergency relief hotline, she‚Äôs heard from people who are struggling because they have medical conditions that require electronic devices or water access, and from dozens whose groceries all spoiled when their power went out. She says in Jackson, the lowest-income Black communities in the south and west are facing the worst effects.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs environmental racism,‚Äù she said.

Infrastructural issues in Jackson aren‚Äôt new, and they‚Äôre also not unique to the city. They‚Äôre endemic in the state, and they disproportionately affect poor, Black populations. Though the spotlight might still be on Texas, it‚Äôs clear that the infrastructure we rely on for modern life is in dire need of updates across the South. If we don‚Äôt make them, low-income people of color will continue to suffer the worst burdens.

During last month‚Äôs southern cold snap, Texas captured headlines. But Mississippi and other parts of the South faced similar frigid conditions that national news crews passed over. Some parts of the state saw their lowest temperatures in recorded history, and water systems throughout central Mississippi were thrown into complete disarray. Jackson‚Äôs main water plant was rendered inoperable by the cold. Davis lost water altogether for two days. While her water is marginally back, others are currently on their third week without any. While the weather has warmed up, people‚Äôs lives are still stuck in mid-February.

Like Texas, Mississippi is a state run by conservatives who believe in very limited government, which has made these immediate issues harder to overcome. Organizers like Davis have stepped in to help, but the lack of national attention has left them with a smaller stream of donations than those pouring into Texas organizations.

‚ÄúTexas needs and deserves all of the resources and assistance that they‚Äôre getting, if not more, but I would love for people not to turn a blind eye to what‚Äôs also happening in Mississippi as well,‚Äù said Davis.

Over the past week, people have started to open their eyes as Jackson‚Äôs water crisis. But stories of other parts of Mississippi, especially its poor, rural areas home to many of the state‚Äôs people of color, are still largely absent. Nearby communities are also on boil-water notice, including Holmes County‚Äôs 98% Black Tchula and 76.2% Black Cruger, and Claireborne County‚Äôs 91.5% Black Port Gibson. Dozens of households in both counties are also still experiencing power outages, as are hundreds within Jackson.

‚ÄúI want clean water and a stable system in the city of Jackson, but not only just in the city of Jackson, I want that for the rural communities that are suffering,‚Äù Danyelle Holmes, a field team lead for the Poor People‚Äôs Campaign who lives in Jackson, said. ‚ÄúAs we speak, right now, they‚Äôre also in the same predicament.‚Äù

Last month‚Äôs cold weather was an acute shock to Mississippi‚Äôs water systems and power grid, but the ongoing damage is the product of decades of neglect and disinvestment. Without funding and support, both systems are bound to fail the people they‚Äôre supposed to serve again, especially as extreme weather becomes more common amid the climate crisis and puts increased pressure on infrastructure.

Long before the recent storm, Jackson was also often plagued by water main breaks and had reported lead concentrations in drinking water well above federal action levels, all the result of aging infrastructure. Many pipes in the city are more than a century old, and official estimates that the necessary upgrades and repairs will cost $2 billion. Jackson‚Äôs water is also frequently contaminated by agricultural runoff in the Mississippi River. On top of that, the city‚Äôs out-of-date water billing system has been a source of inaccurate bills and endless frustration, costing residents time and money for a system that‚Äôs wholly inadequate.

‚ÄúSure, right now we‚Äôre on a boil-water notice, but that happens quite frequently,‚Äù said Holmes. ‚ÄúAnd we often lose pressure at our water treatment plants, so it‚Äôs not unusual for us to experience that or be on a boil water alert. It‚Äôs not even unusual for water to be brown...or to have a smell like chlorine or even smell like sewer. On a good day we have clear water, but on a normal day the water is brown.‚Äù

The city is 82% Black with a median household income under $40,000. Research shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color. While Mississippi is majority-white and a stronghold of the Republican party at the state level, Jackson‚Äôs current mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba‚Äîthe son of a well-known Black revolutionary‚Äîran on a promise to make his city ‚Äúthe most radical city on the planet.‚Äù Improving its infrastructure would be a step in the right direction, yet the city only has so many resources at its disposal; its operating budget is just over $350 million and only a fraction is for water and sewage. Fixing the structural problems facing Jackson‚Äôs infrastructure‚Äîto say nothing of even smaller towns in rural Mississippi‚Äîrequires federal and state help. Yet state officials seem more intent on blaming city officials than working with them.

Mississippi‚Äôs Republican Gov. Tate Reeve intimated that it was city officials‚Äô fault for these infrastructural crises on Jackson‚Äôs city leadership. But Rukia Lumumba, founder of the People‚Äôs Advocacy Institute and sister of Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, said that the state is, in fact, to blame.

‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs response has been significantly inadequate and neglectful,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut they blame it on the progressive, Black leadership.‚Äù



Advertisement

She noted Reeves waited until a week into the water crisis to mobilize the National Guard to help get people water for drinking, cooking, and flushing toilets. It was only Thursday that Reeves announced he requested federal aid despite the ongoing disaster.



This neglect, Lumumba said, is what she‚Äôs come to expect from Reeves. Just last year, he failed to pass a bill that would have provided funding for struggling water ratepayers and infrastructure repairs. Unlike Jackson‚Äôs city leadership, he has also consistently failed to recognize the urgency of the climate crisis, and the ways it will make those repairs and upgrades all the more urgent as it ushers in more erratic weather. That includes not just cold snaps but also heat waves that could increase water demand and increased flooding, which could strain already damaged pipes.

To fix all this, Rukia Lumumba said the state should make funds available immediately, not just to Jackson but also to surrounding rural communities, which are plagued with similar issues. State leaders should also increase the amount of food and water supplies they are distributing to struggling residents. Rukia Lumumba spearheaded the Mississippi Winter Storm Rapid Response Fund through which Davis and Holmes have both been distributing necessary aid, but grassroots organizers depending on donations are no replacement for state leadership and funding.



Beyond these emergency measures, she also said the state should call upon climate experts and local organizers to help determine what infrastructure repairs are needed, and should call upon federal leaders to help fund that plan. On the national level, several proposals in the works which could help secure that funding to fix infrastructure and prepare it for climate change.

Last week, Democratic members of Congress in both chambers reintroduced the WATER Act, which would guarantee $35 billion annually for fixing and replacing infrastructure, addressing water contamination, and providing relief to those with unaffordable water and sewage bills. The coming covid-19 economic relief package could also be an opportunity to mobilize funding to fix water systems. Doing so could also create jobs for the millions around the country who are unemployed. And President Joe Biden has promised to allocate ‚Äú40% of the overall benefits of relevant federal investments‚Äù for frontline communities plagued by environmental injustice.

‚ÄúTo ensure that the resources are getting to the right places, you‚Äôre going to have to go to the grassroots,‚Äù Rukia Lumumba said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to literally talk to the organizations and mayors and [have a] hyperlocal strategy where you‚Äôre not relying on governors to distribute resources justly, fairly, across their state.‚Äù

Putting conservative state leaders in charge of deciding whether or not climate relief or infrastructural funding is available to frontline communities, said Holmes, will lead to further disaster.

‚ÄúIt shouldn‚Äôt be a gamble of if and when the state government is going to act,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe need to fix this issue. We need to fix it now.‚Äù

Some residents are still without water over two weeks into the city's ongoing water crisis, as city officials say improvements continue to be made.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Thursday more residents in the city were experiencing normal water pressure to their faucets.

But Williams did not provide an update of how many more residents have had water restored since Wednesday, when he estimated about a quarter of the city's 43,000 customers remained without water.

Some pockets of south Jackson, largely in higher-elevated areas, are still having water pressure issues. Council President Aaron Banks, who oversees the area, said he has seen progress in recent days. He said Friday morning that a small portion of residents there remained without water. Most of the outages were centered in communities off of McCluer Road, he said.

Water restoration efforts were complicated Wednesday after intake screens at the city's water treatment plant clogged and led to further shortages.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil notice. Testing has revealed the city's water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance the water may contain disease-causing organisms.

Williams said the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city this weekend once the city's water tanks are full and sampling can take place.

Water distribution sites in Jackson

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Friday.

Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said more distribution sites for bottled water could come and city leaders will notify residents when water is available.

Gov. Tate Reeves has said the state has acquired more tanker trucks of non-potable water to be delivered to the city. In addition, resources from the Mississippi National Guard have also been deployed in Jackson to assist residents.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations, mostly in Jackson and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., through Thursday:

Forest Hill High School ‚Äì 2607 Raymond Rd.

Callaway High School ‚Äì 601 Beasley Rd.

Davis Road Park ‚Äì 5901 Terry Rd, Byram

Walton Elementary School ‚Äì 3200 Bailey Ave.

The city encourages residents to report any water main breaks to 311.

WATER CRISIS: Why is my water cloudy?"
40,,Biden Could Help Prevent Water Crises Like the One in Jackson‚ÄîIf He Stands Up to Corporations,"A month after winter storms wreaked havoc across the U.S. South, Jackson, Mississippi is still in the midst of a major crisis. As of March 5, thousands of residents continued to lack water service, and many more were subject to boil water advisories ‚Äî all in the midst of a raging global pandemic that has caused immense suffering, especially in BIPOC communities.

The immediate cause of the crisis was record low temperatures, which caused many of the city‚Äôs aging pipes to break and knocked the main water treatment plant offline. But the situation in Jackson has much deeper roots, and it highlights the intersections between deteriorating infrastructure, racism and white supremacy, racial disparities in public health, and the failures of privatization. As the Biden administration begins to ramp up its infrastructure plans, it should not only prioritize cities like Jackson, but also ensure that badly needed infrastructure investments strengthen and preserve local ownership and control rather than siphon them off to giant corporations and international banks through exploitative and extractive privatization and public-private partnership (PPP) deals.

Like many cities, much of Jackson‚Äôs water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement. While the recent storms exacerbated the system‚Äôs problems, residents in the 82% Black, largely low-income city have long dealt with boil water advisories and contaminated water. In fact, as Gizmodo‚Äôs Dharna Noor points out, ‚Äã‚Äúresearch shows that across the country, contaminated drinking water and water system breakdown is more likely to affect communities of color.‚Äù

The plight of Jackson‚Äôs water system is a direct result of entrenched white supremacy in the state. ‚Äã‚ÄúBe very clear,‚Äù Donna Ladd, founding editor of the Jackson Free Press, recently wrote, ‚Äã‚Äúwhite wealth didn‚Äôt just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn‚Äôt take with them ‚Äî a 20th century Sherman‚Äôs march out of American cities.‚Äù This process has included underfunding the city‚Äôs schools, using state legislation to control what the city can do to generate tax revenue, and, egregiously, attempting to seize control of the city‚Äôs publicly owned airport, which, Ladd writes, is ‚Äã‚Äúone of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left.‚Äù

Much of the attention being paid to Jackson‚Äôs water crisis has highlighted the need for significant federal and state support for water infrastructure modernization. Yet another critical part of the story hasn‚Äôt received the same consideration: The crisis in Jackson demonstrates not only the need for large-scale infrastructure investments, but the dangers of funneling those funds into extractive privatization and PPP deals that are often overly expensive, under-performing, and lack local accountability and control.

In 2012, former Jackson Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. ‚Äî the city‚Äôs first Black mayor ‚Äî realized that previous white-led administrations had left the city‚Äôs water infrastructure in poor shape. As part of his efforts to fix the problem that year, Mayor Johnson signed a $90 million deal with Siemens ‚Äî a large German multinational corporation ‚Äî to upgrade water and sewer facilities, install new water meters and implement an automated billing system. Five years later, however, the Jackson City Council authorized new mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to sue Siemens and its subcontractors for numerous failures related to the contract.

The lawsuit alleged that ‚Äã‚Äúinstead of generating revenue or savings for the City, the work Siemens contracted to complete resulted in problems that have thrown Jackson‚Äôs water-sewer system into crisis and the City further into debt.‚Äù In particular, the new meter and billing system was riddled with problems, leading some residents to never receive a utility bill and others to receive exorbitant bills that they couldn‚Äôt pay. This, in turn, led the city to start moving money from its general fund to pay for water and sewer repairs.

More egregiously, Mayor Lumumba alleged that Siemens and the subcontractors ‚Äã‚Äúmanipulated the minority contracting rules‚Äù to essentially double the cost of the project. While Siemens disputed these accusations, the company nonetheless settled the city‚Äôs lawsuit in early 2020 ‚Äî agreeing to repay the entire $90 million contract. While this was a victory for the city‚Äôs residents, the amount (of which lawyers will take a substantial cut) is far less than the original $450 million the city was seeking when lost revenue and additional costs to repair the damaged system are taken into account.

Jackson is not alone in suffering the ill-effects of corporate involvement in the provision of water. There has been growing resistance to water privatization in the United States in recent years, along with several high-profile remunicipalizations‚Äîwhere privately-run services have been brought back under public control. Three interconnected factors, which were seen to varying degrees in Jackson, are driving many of these local efforts: higher rates and costs under private operation; poor performance and service by private operators; and loss of local control over decision making.

While large-scale investments ‚Äî like the $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden laid out on the campaign trail ‚Äî are urgently needed to address the critical issues facing Jackson and other U.S. communities, the design of such programs will be critical. Those investments could either serve to lower racial and economic inequality, provide high-quality services, and preserve local control by supporting public and cooperative ownership structures; or they could supercharge privatization and line the pockets of large multinational corporations at the expense of the health and prosperity of local residents.

If the Biden administration is serious about ‚Äã‚ÄúBuilding Back Better,‚Äù it must ensure that justice and equity are at the heart of its agenda.","Like many cities, much of Jackson‚Äôs water infrastructure is old and in dire need of repairs and replacement.

41,2021-03-06 02:10:56+00:00,Mississippi city reports progress toward ending water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (Reuters) - A crisis that left thousands of residents of Mississippi‚Äôs capital without running water for weeks appears to be nearing an end, a local official said on Friday, as workers continue to restore service following paralyzing winter storms.

Jackson, the Southern state‚Äôs largest city with a population of more than 160,000 people, again distributed non-potable water at four sites so people could flush their toilets. Residents must still boil any faucet water to kill any disease-causing organisms before using it.

Charles Williams, Jackson‚Äôs public works director, told reporters that workers should be able to start sampling water in affected areas this weekend, a necessary step before the boil advisory can be lifted.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased with our progress,‚Äù Williams said. ‚ÄúPositive progress - a lot better than we were on Monday.‚Äù

Williams estimated that fewer than 5,000 of the city‚Äôs 43,000 water connections - most of which serve multiple households - remain dry.

The problems stemmed from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down that state‚Äôs power grid and leaving millions of people without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.

Jackson resident Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water for the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.

She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. But her husband‚Äôs uncle, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.

‚ÄúIt was very stressful,‚Äù said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ‚Äúthird-world country.‚Äù

Jackson has experienced more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said.

Mayor Chokwe Lumumba sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson‚Äôs water system.

Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children had water service return on Thursday after more than two weeks without it.

‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòOh Lord,‚Äô‚Äù Cattenhead said with relief.

Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.

The crisis also shuttered businesses across the city. Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie‚Äôs, was reopening on Friday for the first time since Feb. 17 after getting water restored on Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Baking Company and Cafe were spending Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening on Saturday morning.

Good said he continued to pay his workers but worried that his restaurants might suffer permanent losses. While he has insurance, Good said that would cover only some of his missing revenue.

43,2021-03-04 06:25:16+00:00,"Jackson, MS is Struggling With a Water Crisis, Who‚Äôs Paying Attention?","by Amy Lupica, ODP Staff Writer

While all eyes were on Texas last month, another part of the U.S. has been dealing with its own water crisis. Parts of Jackson, Mississippi have been without water for almost 3 weeks after cold weather swept through the region. Thousands of people, predominantly people of color, have been impacted by the shortage and are now on a boil water notice. The freezing weather is long gone, but water insecurity still looms for the city‚Äôs 170,000 residents.

Erik D. Olson, who currently directs the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)‚Äôs advocacy initiatives on health, food, and agriculture, says that the stark contrast between the federal responses to the Texas blackout and the Jackson water crisis offers a grim look into the inequality of the effects climate change.

Why This Matters: Low-income communities and communities of color across the country suffer from poor water service and quality at extremely disproportionate rates. Even before the current crisis, Jackson‚Äôs water had some of the highest lead levels in the nation.

Olson reports that these problems didn‚Äôt crop up overnight like a cold winter storm, but were caused by ‚Äúlong-term disinvestment in many communities, and inadequate local, state and federal investment in our water infrastructure across much of the country.‚Äù

He also noted that these crises should serve as a wake-up call, that our nation‚Äôs infrastructure is severely threatened by climate change. ‚ÄúExtreme storms, drought, wildfires, and other effects of changes to the water cycle,‚Äù will impact water security for millions, and people of color and low-income communities will face the worst of it all.

The Payment Problem: Cities across America, including Jackson, are expected to pay for their own infrastructure upgrades with little to no support from the state or federal governments.

In Chicago , that means thousands of lead service pipes can‚Äôt be replaced.

In Campti, Louisiana , it means families must travel for miles just to wash clothing. In Jackson , it means residents are relying on private water-bottle donations to survive.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba (D) told NBC that winterizing the city‚Äôs water infrastructure could cost ‚Äúhundreds of millions of dollars, of which the city of Jackson does not have in its coffers.‚Äù

The city is also struggling to afford emergency repairs for current water main breaks and other infrastructure damage, largely due to lack of state funds and the Governor‚Äôs apparent failure so far to request a federal disaster declaration, which would free up federal funding for recovery efforts.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for an all-hands-on-deck response in Jackson,‚Äù writes Olson, pointing out that President Biden issued federal emergency or disaster declarations in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma for similar circumstances. To prepare our water systems for climate change, Olson says it will take major investments from the federal government and timely legislation from Congress.

But in the meantime, Olson says, Jackson and its people need help, ‚Äúit‚Äôs long past time for the federal government to step in.‚Äù","by Amy Lupica, ODP Staff WriterWhile all eyes were on Texas last month, another part of the U.S. has been dealing with its own water crisis.

Texas authorities ordered 7 million people ‚Äî a quarter of the population of the nation‚Äôs second-largest state ‚Äî to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee‚Äôs largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Memphis International Airport canceled all incoming and outgoing passenger flights Friday due to water pressure issues.

And in Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

‚ÄúWe are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,‚Äù Lumumba said.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to drive to pick it up ‚Äì leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, is running out of his heart medication, with only enough to get him through Sunday because she hasn‚Äôt been able to make it to the pharmacy to refill it.

""People are in dire need here,"" Thomas said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after ice and snow storms swept through early in the week, forcing utilities from Minnesota to Texas to implement rolling blackouts to ease strained power grids.

Texas‚Äô grid operators said Friday that the state's electrical system returned to normal for the first time since a storm knocked out power to more than 4 million customers. Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now has enough capacity to provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure in the energy capital of the U.S., while ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages early Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power and about 71,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snowstorm.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 59 people, including a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered into a frozen pond. A growing number of people have perished as they struggled to keep warm.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

‚ÄúWhat has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,‚Äù Fenton said on ‚ÄúCBS This Morning,‚Äù urging people without heat to go to a shelter or warming center.

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Thursday afternoon, more than 1,000 Texas public water systems and 177 of the state‚Äôs 254 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions, affecting more than 14 million people, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.

Abbott urged Texas residents to shut off water to prevent more busted pipes and preserve municipal system pressure.

Two of Houston Methodist‚Äôs community hospitals had no running water and still treated patients but canceled most non-emergency surgeries and procedures for Thursday and possibly Friday, said spokesperson Gale Smith.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said residents will probably have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect the system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was at ‚Äúcritically low‚Äù levels and also asked its customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building ‚Äî causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skunk lizard.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said the worst of the state‚Äôs water outages were in the northern part of the state and in the southwestern city of Lake Charles, which is struggling to recover from last August's Hurricane Laura.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas and with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Edwards said.

Edwards said he was grateful that warmer weather was forecasted across Louisiana by Saturday.

‚ÄúI expect that over the next several days, we will make repairs to the water systems and get things functioning as close to normal as possible,‚Äù the governor said in a live event with the Washington Post.

In the community of Hackberry near Lake Charles, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn't because he didn't have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and put up her two daughters in another home.

Jackson, Mississippi, is finally on its way out of a nightmare water crisis.

Freezing winter storms wreaked havoc on Jackson‚Äôs old and crumbling water infrastructure. In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water. But while the Texas blackouts dominated the news cycle, Jackson‚Äôs water crises received far less attention, even as it extended into its fourth week. Jackson‚Äôs residents, 80 percent of whom are Black and nearly 30 percent of whom live below the poverty line, have been forced to boil water to drink, bathe, and use the bathroom. They‚Äôve collected rainwater to flush their toilets and bought bottled water to brush their teeth. In the middle of a pandemic, residents of Jackson haven‚Äôt had reliable access to clean water to wash their hands.

This water crisis was years in the making. For the past 50 years the Republican-led state government has been cutting taxes and neglecting to invest in infrastructure repairs. Jackson‚Äôs shrinking tax base has been exacerbated by white flight and the fact that, unlike other capital cities, Jackson doesn‚Äôt make money off property taxes for state-owned buildings. The city of Jackson has a $300 million budget. According to Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Jackson‚Äôs wastewater and drinking water systems require at least $2 billion of repairs.

‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt a matter of if these systems will fail, it‚Äôs a matter of when these systems will fail,‚Äù Lumumba tells Nathalie Baptiste on the Mother Jones Podcast. ‚ÄúPipes were bursting throughout the system because they are over 100 years. They‚Äôre like peanut brittle.‚Äù

On March 17, the city of Jackson Mississippi finally lifted its boil water notice. But Jackson‚Äôs water crisis laid bare the budget, infrastructure, and equity issues that leave cities like Jackson vulnerable to future extreme weather events.

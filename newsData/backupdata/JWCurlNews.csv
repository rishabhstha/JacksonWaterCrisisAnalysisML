JACKSON, Miss. (AP) ‚Äî Mississippi‚Äôs largest city is still struggling with water problems more than two weeks after winter storms and freezing weather ravaged the system in Jackson, knocking out water for drinking and making it impossible for many to even flush their toilets.

Residents in the city of 160,000 are still being warned to boil any water that does come out of the faucets.

‚ÄúI pray it comes back on,‚Äù Jackson resident Nita Smith said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how much more of this we can take.‚Äù

Smith has had no water at home for nearly three weeks.

Smith is concerned about her mother who has diabetes. Her mother and most of the other older people on her street don‚Äôt drive, so Smith has been helping them get water to clean themselves and flush their toilets.

A key focus of city crews is filling the system‚Äôs water tanks to an optimal level. But, public works director Charles Williams said Wednesday that fish, tree limbs and other debris have clogged screens where water moves from a reservoir into a treatment plant. That caused pressure to drop for the entire water system.

‚ÄúToday was not a good day for us,‚Äù Williams said.

He said about a fourth of Jackson‚Äôs customers remained without running water. That is more than 10,000 connections, with most serving multiple people.

City officials on Wednesday continued distributing water for flushing toilets at several pick-up points. But they‚Äôre giving no specific timeline for resolving problems. Workers continue to fix dozens of water main breaks and leaks.

The crisis has taken a toll on businesses. Jeff Good is co-owner of three Jackson restaurants, and two of them remained closed Wednesday. In a Facebook update, Good said the businesses have insurance, but he‚Äôs concerned about his employees.

‚ÄúWe will not be financially ruined,‚Äù Good wrote. ‚ÄúThe spirits of our team members are my biggest concern. A true malaise and depression is setting in.‚Äù

Mississippi‚Äôs capital city is not alone in water problems. More than two weeks have passed since the cold wave shut down the main power grid in Texas, leaving millions in freezing homes, causing about 50 deaths and disabling thousands of public water systems serving those millions.

Four public water systems in Texas remained out of commission Wednesday, affecting 456 customers, and 225 systems still have 135,299 customers boiling their tap water, according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. Also, 208 of the state‚Äôs 254 counties are still reporting public water system issues.

Bonnie Bishop, 68, and her husband, Mike, 63, have been without water at their Jackson home for 14 days. Both have health problems.

She‚Äôs recovering after months in the hospital with the coronavirus. She‚Äôs home but still in therapy to learn how to walk again and deals with neuropathy in her hands and feet.

She has not been able to soak her feet in warm water, something that usually provides relief for the neuropathy, or to help her husband gather water to boil for cooking for cleaning.

Mike Bishop just had elbow surgery. The first week the couple was without water, he still had staples in his arm and was hauling 5-gallon containers from his truck, his wife said. Bonnie Bishop said she told him not to strain himself, but he wouldn‚Äôt listen. They feel they have no choice.

On Monday, the couple drove 25 miles (40 kilometers) to Mike‚Äôs mother‚Äôs house to do laundry.

Jackson‚Äôs water system has not been able to provide a sustainable flow of water throughout the city since the mid-February storms, city officials say.

The system ‚Äúbasically crashed like a computer and now we‚Äôre trying to rebuild it,‚Äù Williams said at a recent briefing.

The city‚Äôs water mains are more than a century old, and its infrastructure needs went unaddressed for decades, Democratic Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has said.

‚ÄúWe more than likely have more than a $2 billion issue with our infrastructure,‚Äù he said.

Jackson voters in 2014 approved a 1-cent local sales tax to pay for improvements to roads and water and sewer systems. On Tuesday, the city council voted to seek legislative approval for another election to double that local tax to 2 cents a dollar.

Republican Gov. Tate Reeves would have to agree to letting Jackson have the tax election.

‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs really important that the city of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money,‚Äù Reeves said Tuesday.

Jackson has had problems for years with its water billing system and with the quality of water.

Melanie Deaver Hanlin, who was without water for 14 days, has been flushing toilets with pool water and showering at friends‚Äô homes. She said Jackson‚Äôs water system ‚Äúneeds to be fixed, not patched.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the issue now ‚Äî poor maintenance for far too long,‚Äù Hanlin said. ‚ÄúAnd Jackson residents are paying the price.‚Äù

Residents of Jackson, Mississippi have been dealing with a water crisis since a storm rolled through town on February 15th. The cityís water system was damaged, leaving thousands of residents without running water at home. People have relied on water distribution sites to get by, and even those who can still use their taps are on boil water notice. Impacted residents are largely low-income, and the limited access to water has raised worries about staying safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Even before this fiasco, Jacksonís water system was in need of a change. Boil water advisories were common, and many of the cityís pipes date back to the 1950s. Water service is expected to be restored this week, but getting the taps running again will just be a Band-Aid: A true overhaul would require millions, if not billions of dollars. Mississippi Public Broadcasting reporter Kobee Vance joins guest host John Dankosky to discuss whatís happening in Jackson, and why its infrastructure was particularly vulnerable to this crisis.

 

Spinning Glass To See The Stars
Last weekend, a giant furnace built under the east stands of the University of Arizona football stadium began to spin. That furnace contained some 20 tons of high-purity borosilicate glass, heated to 1,165 degrees C. As the glass melted, it flowed into gaps in a mold. The centrifugal force of the spinning furnace spread the material up the edges of the mold, forming the curved surface of a huge mirror, with a diameter of 8.4 meters.

The piece is just one of seven sections that will eventually form the 25-meter primary mirror of the Giant Magellan Telescope in Chile. Itís not a fast processóit will take several months to cool, and then another two years to measure, grind, and polish. When thatís complete, the surface of the mirror segment will be accurate to within twenty-five nanometers. Steward Observatory mirror polishing program project scientist Buddy Martin says that when itís complete, the Giant Magellan Telescope should be ten times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescopeóif it was positioned in Washington, DC, it would be able to make out a softball in the hand of a pitcher in San Francisco.

Martin talks with SciFriís Charles Bergquist about the mirror production process, and the challenges of working with glass on massive scales. Watch a video and see photos of the process at scienefriday.com.",Share this on Facebook (Opens in a new window)
2,,"Jackson, Mississippi has an ongoing water crisis. Here‚Äôs how it‚Äôs impacting its citizens.","When winter storms swept throughout the South in mid-February, millions of people lost power and water for days. One of the cities hit hardest was Jackson, Mississippi.

The capital city of Mississippi went without clean water for nearly a month. Some Jackson residents who spoke with ABC News said they have had no running water in their homes for up to three weeks.

This is not the first time there has been a water problem in Jackson. Aging infrastructure of the cityís water pipes, changes in weather patterns and lack of resources, have contributed to inconsistent access to clean water for decades.

ìThey said Ö you experienced the water crisis recently. I would actually argue that we're still in the midst of a water crisis,î Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. ìItís not a matter of, if it's a matter of when it will fail again, until we get the adequate resources to address it.î

After the storms, Lumumba submitted a $47 million proposal to the state to receive funding to repair infrastructure. In 2014, the citizens of Jackson also voted to enforce a 1% sales tax to provide more money for infrastructure, which Lumumba says brings in around $13 million a year.

However, Lumumba told ABC News, ""this is just a starting point"" He said repairing all of Jacksonís infrastructure would cost nearly $2 billion.

President Joe Biden addressed the nationís infrastructure needs and proposed a ìonce-in-a-generationî $2 trillion infrastructure plan that would fix several looming infrastructure issues across the country. Among them would be replacing all lead pipes carrying drinking water.

""I'm convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, 'This was the moment that America won the future.íî Biden said.

Jackson has an over 82% Black population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Lumumba said environmental racism, divestment and white flight all play a part in the city's infrastructure crisis.

ìI think that you find less willingness from the state to support a city like Jackson, because they don't necessarily feel that the demographics of Jackson, or even the politics of Jackson resemble the majority opinion,î Lumumba said. ìWe have to understand that these aren't Democratic or Republican issues. These are our human issues.î

Four citizens of Jackson spoke with ""GMA"" about the impact of the city's water crisis.

Rod McKee has been a teacher and football coach at Wingfield High School in south Jackson, Mississippi for four years. He said water problems not only impacted his students during this yearís winter storms -- but have impacted them every year he has taught in the school.

ìAll four years weíve experienced kids having to be out of school due to a water outage caused by the school pipes bursting from being too old,î McKee said. ìThe school extends school hours from eight to four to make up hours and days in case we have a water crisis, which I feel like is unfair to the students.î

McKee said when the water goes out at school meals are replaced by sack lunches. With extended hours, students may have only having eaten one sack lunch, he said.

While there have been recurring problems throughout the years with water and education, the winter storm that swept Jackson, brought the most severe problems McKee said he had seen in the city.

ìI had students that went a month without water,î McKee said. ìOn top of being home quarantined, and have to learn virtually, that's the last thing I want to do is put pressure on them about a classÖIt was a lot.î

McKee said the school hosted water drives that turned into food drives during this winterís crisis. Many businesses around the area stepped up to deliver hot plates to people who couldnít cook or wash their dishes, he said.

McKee said that he and his family had their own struggles. He had to place a trashcan in his driveway to catch ice so enough water would melt for his family to be able to flush their toilets, he told ABC News.

ìIt shouldíve never gotten to this point. Thereís enough resources. This is America,î McKee said.

Danyelle Holmes, a Jackson resident since 1991 and a national organizer with the Poor Peopleís Campaign, was on the ground helping out her fellow Jackson residents after the storm this winter.

Holmes told ABC News that her group focused on not only handing out clean water, but also giving a stipend to Jackson residents for the work they were doing in the community.

ìWe gave out over 100,000 cases of water over the state of Mississippi,î Holmes said. ìJust in the city of Jackson we gave out close to $100,000. Our assistance is still going on.î

While this water crisis was amplified by the winter storm, Holmes said there have always been water issues in Jackson. In the thirty years she has lived in the city, she said she has never drunk water out of the tap.

ìItís always brown. Even at my home having brown water is normal,î Holmes said. ìIíve always relied on bottled or filtered water.î

Holmes said the water issues come from years of infrastructure issues in Jackson and she hopes the magnitude of the water outages caused by this yearís winter storm will bring light to the improvements the city needs.

ìIt took the negligence on our leadership on just not really investing into the capital. The very city they have to come to to handle their business has been neglected for years,î Holmes said. ìThis winter storm had to happen in order to expose Ö what's actually going on what's still going on in the state of Mississippi.î

Willie William has lived in Jackson, Mississippi, since 2000 and three years ago started his own local business -- a food truck called Scherriaís Chicken Coop.

During the water crisis, William was hired by World Central Kitchen to make hot plates for many in the community who didnít have food. Each week for three weeks, William made 2,000 to 3,000 hot meals to deliver to people in the community.

William was more than happy to help, but after a year of dealing with the pandemic, the water crisis made business harder for him.

ìIt makes the work ten times harder. You have to boil the water when youíre doing everything,î William said. ìI buy five-gallon water jugs to cook out because the water is still not safe. It makes it difficult for your customer base too because you have to change a lot of the menu items ... When the pandemic came the numbers for food werenít up so we had to change the prices on our menu.î

While the water crisis impacted William as a small business owner, as a Jackson citizen water issues have become a part of life.

ìThereís been numerous times the water has been low pressure or sometimes the rusted water, William said. ìThe water system is very old here. It needs to be replaced and thatís something thatís understood. But thatís going to take a lot of funding, something we probably donít have in the budget.î

William hopes that this winterís crisis and awareness of the problem inspires change, but until then, he said, the members of the Jackson community will each do their part to help.

ìJackson is a violent city right now but thereís a lot of people here that still care and just try to give back and do what we can,î William said. ìWeíre one tight-knit community.î

Pastor Arthur Sutton

Arthur Sutton, a pastor at Progressive M.B. Church, has lived in Jackson for 52 years. When the water ran dry after the winter storms on Feb. 16, he said he had never seen anything like that before.

ìI have never seen it like this before,î Sutton said. ìI was without water, no pressure, nothing for 17 days. When the water came back on we had to wait a minute because of the different types of debris and substances inside the water ..when you boiled your water the stuff was still there.î

As a pastor, Sutton wasnít just worried for himself but for all the members of his church. When other Baptists churches across the country heard about the water crisis in Jackson, they began reaching out to Sutton to send his church water.

ìWeíve probably given out close to 100 of more pallets of water. Most pallets come with 60 to 84 cases of water,î Sutton said. ìThatís a lot of water.î

Sutton said many members of his church were elderly and unable to pick up water for themselves, so they set up a delivery service.

ìIt was bad, Iím going to be honest with you,î Sutton said. ìIt hurts when everybody else starts getting water and youíre the last to get water.î

Sutton says officials need to communicate and assure the citizens of Jackson that they will not have to deal with a crisis like this in the future.

ìWhat they need to do is they need to get together and talk and communicate where this does not happen again,î Sutton says. ìWhatever funding that we need, we need to get it and we can go ahead and repair our infrastructureÖto where if something happens that these people can still get water.î

Government and the environment

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that while over 93% of Americans have water from community water systems that meet all health standards, there are improvements to be made.

ìEPA understands that more work needs to be done so that everyone in the United States has access to safe water that meets EPAís standards ñ no matter the color of their skin, money on their pocket, or zip code,î EPA Senior Public Affairs Specialist Cathy Milbourn said in a statement.

According to EPA, over $743 billion is needed for water infrastructure improvements in the Untied States.

To date, EPAís State Revolving Funds have provided more than $189 billion in assistance for nearly 43,000 water quality infrastructure projects and 16,500 drinking water projects. In the past two years, these State Revolving Funds have also created over 300,000 jobs.

President Biden has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure overhaul, the American Jobs Plan. Part of the plan proposes eliminating ìall lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems, improving the health of our countryís children and communities of color,î the plan states on the White House website.

Many Republicans have signaled they donít support the proposal but Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said on ABCís ìThis Weekî that the GOP is willing to negotiate on a smaller package.

While cities like Jackson continue to fight for funding at both the state and federal levels, Jackson Mayor Lumumba encourages people who want to help their community to donate money to philanthropic causes set up to help with the water crisis.

ìIn the midst of people being without running water in their homes we had a number of good Samaritans from not only across the city but across the country,î Lumumba said.

Lumumba hopes that an awareness of the issue in Jackson will bring about the changes necessary to build a more sustainable water system.

ìWe need to continue to lift up the need for infrastructure. At this point, what is the success and failure of our economy?î Lumumba said. ìIt needs to be less about the stock market and more about sustainable development goals, whether people have access to sustainable infrastructure. Those are the metrics we need to evaluate this nation.î",

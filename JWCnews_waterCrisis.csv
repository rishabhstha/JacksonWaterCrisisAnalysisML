0,"Mar 3, 2021",Jackson Free Press,Jackson’s Water Crisis Lingers into March,"Robert Sulton has lived in south Jackson since 2007, when he and his wife built their home just north of Byram. They had experienced power outages and boil-water notices before, but none as bad as the last two weeks of February 2021.

""I guess you take a lot for granted when you have water to just be able to turn on the faucet and see the water running or do whatever, but when you don't have it, I mean, it's a humbling experience,"" Sulton told the Jackson Free Press. ""It really is.""

Sulton was one of many south Jackson residents who would be without water for the better part of February, when a winter storm battered the state for days.

On the night of Feb. 11, temperatures in Jackson plummeted to freezing, and then they stayed that way. For the next nine days, Jackson stood still through bitter days and frozen nights. As the cold lingered, city infrastructure incurred increasingly alarming damage.

Left without water, Sulton explained his frustrations and hopes with the city. He has lived in and around Jackson since 1985, when he moved here to attend Jackson State University. He has moved around the area since then, but built his home in south Jackson in 2007, nearer to Byram but still within Jackson.

But Sulton's frustrations are not just about water.

Neglected South, West Jackson

Before the storm, Sulton and his entire neighborhood had to deal with the smell of sewage coming from what amounted to a drainage ditch that reeked like a sewage tap near their homes.

They breathed the putrid air from the fall of 2020 until recently before the winter storm hit, though Sulton is not sure if the problem might creep back up when temperatures rise.

He and his wife first lost most of their water pressure on Feb. 16, and power the next day. Their power outage lasted until Feb. 20, but as of March 2, they, like many Jackson residents, did not have working faucets or safe water.

Sulton counts himself lucky compared to some, because he is able to stay at a hotel when necessary. ""It's very frustrating, he said. Even with the ability to stay at hotels, their lives are disrupted.

""There's a lot of riding, there's a lot of driving back and forth,"" he said.

Still, Sulton has hope for Jackson.

""Jackson has so much potential,"" he said. ""I mean the entire city. I think a lot of times the leadership of the city gets pigeonholed into focusing on certain parts of the city, and I think the western and southern parts of the city get neglected. Those are the areas where you have the most people, and I think that this is putting a gigantic spotlight on that.

""It's kind of glaring that the area of the city with water is the area that the City has continually focused on and that's out north, and then the area that's been neglected is the areas that are suffering right now. So hopefully, hopefully, these spotlights will help to change some things.""

'I Owe You Honesty'

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba held numerous press events to relay the status of repairs in the city as they happened. ""I owe you honesty,"" Lumumba said on Feb. 18. ""I owe you the truth so that we can prepare for how we manage through this winter emergency.""

Even as the mayor explained how workers were clearing away tree limbs and repairing power lines, he could not give an estimate of when water might return to the city. ""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Lumumba said. ""Only to tell you that we are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover within the water system.""

As the days wore on, Lumumba and Jackson officials announced various locations for water giveaways, which are still ongoing as of press time. Non-potable water was available at fire stations around the city, and drinking water is distributed at various times and locations daily.

Even the New Orleans Pelicans basketball organization was sending two truckloads of water to Jackson after a tweet from Jackson author and superfan Angie Thomas.

""We understand our residents' frustration, I understand that most people don't care how a watch works,"" Lumumba said in a Feb. 22 press briefing. ""They just want to be able to tell time.""

Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes, who had endorsed Lumumba for his first term, took aim at the mayor's response, accusing his administration of being too slow to respond to the crisis and calling for faster action in distributing reserve water tankers. For his part, Lumumba defended his actions, calling the storm an ""act of God.""

'Hundred Year Old Pipes'

As the winter storm swept the country, it exposed infrastructure vulnerabilities in cities across the South.

Public Works Director Williams, who had worked with Jackson's infrastructure for 19 years before accepting his current leadership post, described the history and issues surrounding Jackson's and the country's, aging infrastructure in an interview with the Jackson Free Press on Feb. 28.

""The U.S. is not getting younger, it's getting older,"" Williams said. ""A lot of the infrastructure that was put in in the late 1800s, early 1900s. They have seen their life expectancy, but yet they're still utilizing those infrastructure assets now,"" Williams said. ""And so it's time to dedicate some resources toward upgrades.""

A 2013 water assessment concluded that Jackson did indeed have 100-year-old piping in many areas. ""Those pipes are now a lot older,"" Williams said. ""There's a lot of iron pipe in Jackson, and there's concrete pipe in Jackson, and they need to be upgraded.""

In addition to unreliable and, for now, unsafe city water mains, older residential piping may still harbor a more insidious contaminant—lead. The question of lead contamination in Jackson water remains year after year, arising especially when treated city water contains a certain chemistry capable of wearing away old lead joints in residential piping, as happened in 2016.

In that year, the alkaline levels raised concerns that treated city water may chemically melt the mineral coating on lead parts in older homes. This is the same type of alkalinity issue that arose in Flint, Mich., when that city switched water sources.

In Jackson, the majority of tested homes did not have actionable levels of lead, or more than 15 parts per billion. City officials did, however, warn that children and mothers-to-be should avoid drinking tap water until the City resolved the alkalinity issue.

Williams is not aware of any areas that still contain lead piping, but that could be due to insufficient sampling. ""There may be some isolated areas that we don't know about, but we do not know of any areas that do have lead piping or lead joints,"" he said.

Unless funding is increased for broader sampling, however, residents must make do with a do-it-yourself test kit. These kits are $15 to $20 and may be purchased from the Mississippi State Department of Health Public Health Laboratory by calling 601-576-7582 or from Micro-Methods Laboratories at 228-875-6420. The cost pays for the kit, shipping and lab results, which will take two to four weeks to return.

How to Pay for It?

Funding is the looming issue for Jackson's infrastructure upgrades. Jackson's water-treatment facilities, water-collection lines and sewer lines all require upgrades.

""I hope that after this winter storm, and we've seen the impact from Texas all the way to Mississippi and the number of residents that have suffered from a water outage, I think it shows how vulnerable our infrastructure system is and how important it is for us to have funding available to make these critical upgrades,"" Williams said Feb. 28.

""The question is, how are they going to do it? Where are they going to do it?""

As of yet, no discussions are happening between the City of Jackson and the State Legislature to resolve the water crisis, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann confirmed on March 1, indicating that it was the City's responsibility to ask for help. ""Any additional resources that we can get to help address our infrastructure problems I think it's a win-win for our citizens,"" Williams said.

Mayor Lumumba has repeatedly named $2 billion as the cost of repairing and upgrading Jackson's century-old infrastructure, but Williams says calculating an actual cost may be more difficult.

""That depends on where you would disperse those funds,"" he said. ""You've got to remember that you've got different infrastructure systems. You've got drainage issues throughout the city.

You still need funding for roads. And then you've got your utilities on water and sewer.

""So It's very hard to put an exact number on that because when you look at a city of Jackson's size and looking at all of those different infrastructure systems. You would have to look at them each independently and how you want to address them and then determine what kind of cost it would take in order to do all of them separately.""

Williams hopes federal funding will soon become a boon instead of a roadblock.

""We hope in this new administration that they will provide more infrastructure funding to the state and ultimately to municipalities like Jackson,"" he said.

""We need federal assistance in order to assist us, and then we hope that at some point a true infrastructure bill will be provided and the city will become an opportunity to benefit from some of that funding.""

For now, Jackson must wait for the all clear as repairs are completed, and the City awaits a negative test for water contamination.

1,"Mar 2, 2021",NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis brings to light long-standing problems in city","After more than two weeks without clean running water, Katasha Johnson saw a slow trickle dribbling down a faucet in her home on the west side of Jackson, Mississippi, on Tuesday.

But the brown drip didn't feel like a reprieve for Johnson, 38, who lost water after back-to-back winter storms slammed the city and its century-old water infrastructure last month.

""It's not enough to do anything with, and it doesn't even look safe,"" said Johnson, the mother of children ages 9, 6 and 3.

Instead, Johnson and her fiancé are using melted snow and collected rainwater stored in four large coolers to flush the toilet. To clean dishes and hands, Johnson boils pots of water taken from a bathtub that was pre-filled when water was available.

""It has been absolutely horrible to live like this,"" she said.

Jackson has entered the third week of a crisis that has left much of the city without water since freezing temperatures devastated much of the South. Community leaders say that the disaster isn't a one-off and that it has brought to light long-simmering issues of systemic breakdown and neglect.

Weeks after the storm, the city continues to be under a boil water notice, and residents are being urged to conserve water and lower consumption as much as possible. Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city. Many say they have been turned away after supplies ran out.

Jackson reported 96 main water breaks and leaks, 53 of which have been repaired, the mayor's office said a statement.

""Today we saw pressure stay around 83 to 85 psi. This is good, but ultimately, we need to get to 90 psi and stay there consistently in order for water to be restored to everyone. This is an old system and we are taking it day by day as it recharges itself,"" the statement said.

More than half of the city's schools are closed because of the water crisis; only 19 of nearly 50 public schools have reopened.

While it's still unclear how many residents are out of water, community leaders, like state Rep. Ronnie Crudup, say it's at least 40,000.

Staff members and volunteers with the MS Black Women's Roundtable recently joined with other community partners in providing critical resources like water, hot meals and other necessities at Wingfield High School as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Crudup has had no water for 16 days. He lives with his wife and two grandchildren, ages 9 and 10, in the hardest-hit part of the city, in South Jackson.

""We can't bathe, we can't cook food, we can't wash dishes, we can't do laundry. It's tremendously difficult,"" he said.

Crudup said that the city's infrastructure was already frail and that the crisis has highlighted how easily it can break.

""Infrastructure has been a historic problem, and for years each administration kept kicking that can down the road,"" he said. ""This is a longtime issue, but now we're paying a severe price for that neglect.""

Cassandra Welchlin, executive director of the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable and co-founder of the Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative, a local nonprofit organization, said the water crisis has highlighted a slew of underlying issues long afflicting the community.

""This was a breakdown of a system that was supposed to be in place for the safety of our citizens,"" she said. ""This water crisis has really exacerbated a system that has never really worked for poor folks, Black folks, seniors, for so many people.""

Church as part of an ongoing relief effort underway in Jackson, Miss. Mississippi Black Women's Roundtable

Jackson's population is more than 80 percent Black.

Welchlin said the government hasn't invested in Jackson's infrastructure for a very long time.

""All of this is interconnected. Because of the water crisis, some families lost a week of pay because many people couldn't work. Teachers couldn't teach because they don't have internet connection. They don't have power. Many people were unable to provide, so this is a much larger issue than a lot of people might see,"" she said.

Welchlin and Crudup said state and federal intervention is necessary to fully address not just infrastructure but all of the underlying issues connected to the crisis.

In the interim, several groups have stepped up to aid community members. The Mississippi Women's Economic Security Initiative and other local organizations have coordinated supplies, water and services for residents in need. They have donated gift cards for food and bills and arranged for water trucks, and they have been dropping off cases of bottled water.

But many residents have also had to dip into their own pockets. Kehinde Gaynor, 42, has had to rent three hotel rooms in the last two weeks to give his wife and three children a place with safe water to bathe and wash.

Many residents have had to do that, he said, and the expenses have added up very quickly.

""Not having water isn't new to us. We've lost it before, but never as long as this,"" he said. ""It's affecting every part of our life, and to me it feels like we're the next Flint, Michigan.""","Residents have been lining up at several sites that distribute non-potable water or water for flushing throughout the city.

JACKSON, Miss. – Two weeks into a water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, after a series of winter storms, city officials say they do not know how many residents are still without water or when water will be restored.

Public Works Director Charles Williams said Tuesday that there are still pockets of homes in south Jackson's high-elevation areas without water, but he could not share a total number of outages.

He said water pressure at the city's treatment plant was gradually being restored, but a firm date for restoration of the system remains elusive.

For more than two weeks, residents in the city of 160,000 have been warned to boil any water that does come out of kitchen taps before using it.

Williams had said he was hopeful the system would be up to speed by Feb. 26, the weekend after the city first reported a water shortage on Feb. 17.

Instead, he said the prolonged freezing temperatures from winter storm systems crippled a system unequipped to deal with the temperature drop.

More than 100 water breaks reported

The system is still not putting out enough water pressure to service its more than 43,000 customers. That has been complicated by water main breaks across the city that have leaked water into city streets and yards. Since the city first reported a water shortage, more than 100 water breaks have been reported. As of Monday night, crews had completed 53 repairs, he said.

Williams said Tuesday that it's possible a large water main break that has not been reported is also siphoning water from the city's water supply.

""A hard number is difficult to track,"" Williams said. ""We would have to go door-to-door to know precisely where all the outages are.""

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has also been been hesitant to give a firm date for recovery of the water system.

The city has been tracking outages through reports from residents and its 311 hotline. The mayor's spokeswoman, Michelle Atoa said that as of Tuesday afternoon the hotline had received more than 1,500 water outage calls since Feb. 15, but she was unable to provide a hard number of residence outages or an estimate.

The mayor's office said in an email that it had crews out Tuesday in south Jackson neighborhoods and in higher elevated areas of the city where residents are still experiencing outages. The crews are testing pressure levels and releasing trapped air from hydrants that may be impeding flow.

Seven distribution sites for non-potable water remain open across the city, and the city is also delivering bottled water to elderly and homebound residents.

You Can’t Wash.’ Water Crisis Hobbles Jackson, Miss., for Weeks","Mr. Reeves called in the National Guard last month to help distribute water and has hinted that the state might take over Jackson’s water system. His chief of staff, Brad White, said the governor’s office was helping the city explore securing low-interest state loans to help pay for upgrades. He also noted that Mr. Lumumba had been meeting with members of the Republican-dominated State Legislature, including Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in an effort to secure more state funding.

In an interview this week, Mr. Lumumba said he hoped the current crisis would finally push both state and city officials in the direction of a long-term solution.

“There’s a saying that you should allow no crisis to go to waste,” he said. “It’s crises like these that really allow us to take stock of conditions of where we are as a city, where we are as a state and hopefully it allows us to build the resolve to address it.”

The city has had a dwindling tax base for decades, after the integration of schools and other public spaces in Jackson triggered a dramatic flight of white residents. In many cases, they took their wealth and tax dollars with them. In 1960, the city was about 64 percent white and 36 percent Black. Today it is about 16 percent white and 82 percent Black.

It's been a month since some in Jackson, Miss., had usable running water. A winter storm hit the aging infrastructure in the majority Black city, and many are angry about how long the fix is taking.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Hundreds of residents in Jackson, Miss., are now in week four of a water crisis. Some in the majority-Black capital city still don't have water after last month's winter storm. Others have to boil their water first. Mississippi Public Broadcasting's Becca Schimmel spent time with a family struggling to get by.

BECCA SCHIMMEL, BYLINE: Marion Roberts has been without running water since the middle of February.

MARION ROBERTS: I'm turning the faucet on and off. And as you can see, there's no drips. There's no nothing. It's just dry. Nothing, no water.

SCHIMMEL: Roberts keeps her faucets open, so she'll hear the water as soon as it comes back on. She lives with her three adult children. The winter storm that ravaged Texas, causing millions of people there to lose power and water, also hit Mississippi, freezing pipes and breaking decades-old water mains. Roberts has been trying to pick up water from city distribution sites or buy it at grocery stores so that her family can try to have some sense of normalcy.

ROBERTS: So I've been trying to, like, keep up with it. We take baths with it. We take, like, four bottles of water, take a bath. Yeah. And we brush our teeth - is one bottle. We're still not able to wash dishes.

SCHIMMEL: All of those mundane and routine tasks people take for granted require more time and effort for the nearly 500 homes and businesses in Jackson that still have no water. Even flushing her toilet requires her to fill it up each time. So Roberts now has a new daily routine.

ROBERTS: Start going through the process of getting everything together. These bottles are empty. As you can see, there's an empty bottle right there. We start loading stuff up in the trunk. I had a water cooler. And we'd just fill up the water and then bring it back to the house. And I would do that probably - I was doing it twice a day. Now I'm down to doing it once a day. So, like, tomorrow, if I need some more water, I'll go back, fill up.

SCHIMMEL: Robert's 20-year-old daughter Melody hasn't had a proper shower at home for weeks. Every day when she goes to college, she worries about what other people think.

MELODY: It don't make me feel so confident as much as I am because I'm like, I cleaned myself, but what if I have a smell to me because I don't have water at home?

SCHIMMEL: And her mother, Marion, cares deeply for her city. Seeing the people of Jackson go without water for so long is maddening, especially when it feels like people outside the state have forgotten about Mississippians who are suffering.

ROBERTS: I mean, I feel like the help has lessened. You don't see the National Guard out here anymore. Everybody's gone. It's like, forget them. And I feel like it's because of the color of my skin. And I hate that.

SCHIMMEL: South Jackson, where the Roberts live, has been hit especially hard by the water crisis. Jackson's population is about 80% Black and has long had trouble getting the attention and financial help it needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba doesn't deny how racism has factored into the city's underfunded infrastructure.

CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: I think that if we're honest with ourselves, we have to recognize the role that that plays. Often, we're a bit skittish of having those conversations. But we have to realize that issues of race are as American as apple pie.

SCHIMMEL: Lumumba says the city has known it's needed to rebuild its infrastructure for years. In 2010, another big freeze did even more damage than this winter storm. The mayor says Jackson needs help, and it's going to take state or federal funding to secure safe drinking water. For Marion Roberts, she's debating what's next for her.

ROBERTS: I mean, I love the city of Jackson. I love Mississippi. I was raised here. But if I had a choice, to be honest, if I can get up and move - like, somebody told me, you can go anywhere - I would move.

SCHIMMEL: It's still unclear when the water will be back on for the hundreds of people like her. For NPR News, I'm Becca Schimel in Jackson, Miss.

5,"th · Mar 15, 2021",Slate,Ignore Mississippi’s Water Crisis at Your Own Peril,"For four weeks now, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have had no potable water. Even though repairs are underway for dozens of broken water mains and other equipment, the city’s 161,000 residents remain under a boil-water advisory, and hundreds still have no running water at all. The story is similar to ones we’ve heard before: thousands of mostly Black residents struggling to carry on without access to the most essential of necessities; a decades-old, multibillion-dollar water system in desperate need of major repair; proposed funding solutions that don’t go nearly far enough. But what separates Jackson from other ongoing municipal water crises nationwide, and worldwide, is its particular catalyst and the aftereffects.

The water crises that captured the most headlines in recent years were the result of governmental and corporate malpractice. Cities like Flint, Michigan—which is still grappling with lead-contaminated water—and Summerville, Georgia, saw their drinking water become unsafe after those in power tried to skirt regulations or save a few bucks. But Jackson was hit by a different kind of beast, one that threatens us all: a government unprepared to handle the effects of climate change and neglectful of the citizens who are most harmed by it.

The same storms that capsized Texas’ power grid in February also dumped unprecedented amounts of snow throughout the South. Virginia, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Mississippi all had energy or water stoppages, or both, as a result. Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting. In Jackson alone, about 80 water mains broke. But by late February, as safe water began flowing back to the hard-hit South, Jackson’s leaders kept pushing back their own projected deadlines for potable water restoration, and Gov. Tate Reeves briefly pondered a state takeover of the city’s water system. Though thousands of Texans are still struggling with their own busted pipes, its water treatment plants could at least resume operations following power restoration. In Jackson, the damage was even deeper.

Mississippi is the most impoverished state in the country; it’s also among the sickest and most publicly underfunded, with hospitals, schools, and other public services unable to properly serve residents, even when they aren’t being pummeled by storms. City workers tasked with repairing the water system have noted that some parts of it are a century old, and that the parts that aren’t nearly as ancient are quite brittle. The storms also directly maimed necessary equipment for the water treatment plants, hurting the purifying process even after power came back. The city’s O.B. Curtis Plant saw its intake screens freeze and raw water pumps malfunction while its feeder reservoir dropped in temperature. Drivers couldn’t deliver needed treatment chemicals to the plant for a while because of the icy, broken roads. Add that to a recent history of poor disaster management: In 2015, then–Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber declared two separate states of emergency for the city’s infrastructure, citing water mains and roads that were cracking under pressure from more mild winter weather. It was a unique order that could have spurred much-needed repairs, but the City Council overturned the second emergency order, and only a few fixes funded by state aid were eventually made in the following years. For this more recent disaster, it was only last week that the city signed off on a request to the state to provide $47 million for repairs.

Usually, water crises fueled by climate change are most visibly perceived in the form of droughts, groundwater depletion, sea level rise, or historic flooding. In Jackson, the water crisis stemmed from a bureaucratic infrastructure issue: the vulnerability of essential water treatment plants to unprecedented storms that are growing in frequency. In the same way Texas’ energy troubles demonstrated the need to mandate power grid winterization, Jackson’s emergency shows how our officials must work to protect the thing most of us take completely for granted. But that will also cost a lot of money and require major reform. If the Democratic-dominated federal government is already having issues figuring out national infrastructure priorities, the hard-right Mississippi Legislature certainly won’t fulfill its own state’s needs. More than likely, your city or state is facing similar woes.

These problems will play out first, though, in places struggling most with poverty and racism. Jackson’s population is 82 percent Black, and despite being the state’s capital and most populous metropolis, it suffers from a meager tax base, as its wealthier white residents fled the city in increasing numbers following the civil rights era; about a quarter of the city lives in poverty. Jackson’s Black leaders have long been aware of the issues plaguing their city and tried to do what they can to solve them, only to be rebuffed time and again by the mostly white and Republican state government. Climate change will only exacerbate such inequalities.

Not every American city has the same forces working against it as Jackson does, but the problems occurring there will also happen elsewhere. Many Americans have been lucky to have stable shelter, power, water, and protection against the coronavirus throughout the past year. But that’s all that is—luck. Unless governments take the appropriate response to heavily bolster our infrastructure and protect our most vulnerable, there’s no reason to think anybody will be so fortunate to escape unscathed the next time the storms come around. Jackson’s suffering residents know this all too well.","Water mains were damaged, reservoirs froze, and residents had to leave their faucets running to prevent pipes from bursting.
Though thousands of Texans are still struggling with their own busted pipes, its water treatment plants could at least resume operations following power restoration.
The storms also directly maimed necessary equipment for the water treatment plants, hurting the purifying process even after power came back.
In Jackson, the water crisis stemmed from a bureaucratic infrastructure issue: the vulnerability of essential water treatment plants to unprecedented storms that are growing in frequency.
Many Americans have been lucky to have stable shelter, power, water, and protection against the coronavirus throughout the past year."
6,"Mar 10, 2021",Mississippi Today,Lawmakers weigh options for Jackson water crisis,"Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba has made his case to legislative leaders for state funding to help solve the city’s water crisis. They now have about three weeks to decide whether to step up and how.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, city officials say “most” residents have had water service restored. City leaders, who have neglected funding the system for decades, say they need major investment from the state to repair system, which is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.

Lawmakers are in the final three weeks of the 2021 legislative session, which is scheduled to end on April 4 — though leaders are suggesting they could finish business sooner.

With the clock ticking, Lumumba met with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who presides over the Senate, in a closed-door meeting on Tuesday morning. He made two main asks that mirrored a March 5 meeting with Speaker of the House Philip Gunn:

• Support a bill that would allow Jackson to raise its sales tax by 1 cent. If lawmakers and Jackson voters sign off on that proposal, the city would use that new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — to back large bonds for water and sewer system repairs.

• Send the city $47 million in emergency funding for immediate necessary repairs on water treatment facilities following the 2021 winter storm.

Hosemann, a Jackson resident who told Mississippi Today on Monday “all options are on the table” regarding funding for the Jackson water crisis, took notes as the mayor and others in the meeting spoke, several of the meeting’s attendees told Mississippi Today. Hosemann asked several questions of Charles Williams, the city’s public works director, who gave a detailed accounting of the city’s funding needs — including both the $47 million emergency ask and long-term system replacement.

State Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson, explained a bill he filed Monday that seeks legislative sign-off on the 1-cent sales tax increase. Hosemann said that if the House passes Bell’s bill, the Senate would consider moving it through their chamber.

The city officials left Hosemann’s office after about 50 minutes with no promises, but Lumumba told Thao Ta at WJTV after the meeting that he was encouraged by the conversation. Sources close to Hosemann said he will meet with every state senator representing the city of Jackson on Wednesday or Thursday to discuss the crisis and funding options.

Here are the options and variables being considered at the Capitol moving forward, according to several legislative sources in both the House and Senate:

1) The 1-cent sales tax increase

Rep. Bell’s bill, which is modeled after a bill lawmakers passed for the city of Tupelo in 1988, would acquire legislative approval for Jackson to raise its sales tax on certain retail items within city limits. If lawmakers pass the bill, the city’s residents would have to approve the tax hike in a summer vote.

Lumumba believes the increase in the sales tax is critical to securing large-scale funding in the short term. But by Tuesday, House leaders were privately and publicly questioning whether they should sign off. “It creates a precedent, if you will, that may be a dangerous area to go to as far as other cities around the state wanting to do the same thing,” Gunn told Scott Simmons at WAPT on Tuesday. “And we may get in a situation where the tax burden is just too great.”

In the Tuesday meeting with the mayor, Hosemann said the Senate would consider Bell’s bill if it passes the House. One consideration is how Jackson’s Senate delegation feels about the proposal. Last week, state Sen. John Horhn, a Democrat from Jackson who is close with Hosemann and ran unsuccessfully against Lumumba in the 2017 mayor’s race, told Mississippi Today he did not support the new 1-cent sales tax increase, saying it could drive businesses and people out of Jackson.

2) $47 million in state bonds

There is appetite on both sides of the Capitol to come up with the $47 million the city has requested. In the grand scheme of the Legislature’s annual bond process, $47 million is not too heavy a lift. City leaders have thoroughly and specifically explained to legislative leaders what they would use that money for, appeasing a general concern among lawmakers — Republican and Democrat — that the city has not always spent its money productively in years past.

But Gunn’s comments to WAPT on Tuesday and recent comments from Hosemann suggest that lawmakers representing the entire state will want to request their share of funds for aging infrastructure in other parts of the state. Jackson leaders will argue, however, that no other water systems in the state are failing to the point of leaving 40,000 residents without water for three weeks.

3) Appropriating federal stimulus package funding to the city

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said he personally spent hours the past week reading the $1.9 trillion stimulus package Congress passed on Wednesday. The Legislature will receive a substantial amount of federal money — early estimates suggest more than $1.5 billion — to appropriate.

But Congress just passed the package on Wednesday, and states won’t receive most of the federal funds for around 60 days. After they finish the session on April 4, state lawmakers are not scheduled to meet in Jackson again until January 2022. Because of the timing of the new stimulus package, however, many inside the building expect the Legislature will pass rules to allow them to convene in Jackson any time in 2021 to determine how to spend the stimulus funds. The bottom line: The timing of federal funding might not work well with the city’s needs for immediate funding, depending on what else lawmakers can come up between now and April 4.

The city of Jackson remains under a boil-water notice after two winter storms disrupted daily life last week.

More than 10,000 across Mississippi are still without power and water, according to the latest estimate from PowerOutage.US. There is still no definitive timetable for when these utilities will return.

Here is what you need to know and what you need to do — as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — if you and your household remain under a boil-water notice:

FOR SUBSCRIBERS: Mississippi still reeling from winter storms as leaders struggle to deal with fallout

JACKSON WATER CRISIS: Residents, businesses still with little to no water

What do I do if I'm under a boil-water notice?

The CDC and the Mississippi State Department of Health suggest bringing water to a full boil for 1 minute and allowing it to cool before using it. The health department recommends the following steps:

Don't drink tap water

Don't use iced made from recent tap water

Don't use tap water to make drinks, juices or fountain soft drinks.

Only cook with tap water if food is boiled for at least one minute.

Brush your teeth with boiled or bottled water

You should boil tap water even if it is filtered, including water from a refrigerator or ice maker.

Can you shower/bathe with a boil water order?

It is safe to shower, but be careful not to swallow any water. Young children should be supervised to ensure they don't drink water.

Can you wash dishes during a boil-water notice?

Dishwashers are typically safe to use if the final rinse temperature reaches at least 150 degrees or if the machine has sanitizing cycle. Otherwise, it is best to used disposable dishes and utensils.

While the CDC says dishwashers are generally safe to use, the Mississippi State Department of Health does not recommend it.

If you need to wash dishes by hand, wash and rinse as you normally would using hot water, but in a separate basin add 1 teaspoon of unscented household liquid bleach for each gallon of warm water. Soak the rinsed dishes in the water for at least one minute, and let dishes air dry before using.

Can you do laundry?

Yes, laundry can be done as usual during a boil-water advisory.

What about pets?

Pets could also get sick from drinking water during a boil-water advisory. Provide your animals with bottled water or boiled water.

What do I do when the boil-water notice is lifted?

According to the state health department, here are the steps to take:

Flush faucets for a total of 10 minutes to introduce system water throughout the house plumbing Flush faucet a minimum of 2 minutes to ensure clearing of the line serving the faucet

Discard any drinks, ice, food, etc, made during the boil water notice.

Rewash any food or drink contact items (knives, forks, plates, etc.) with cleared system water.

Check water filters and replace if necessary.

Do not use water from your hot water heater for drinking until several exchanges of the tank have occurred.

Run dishwasher through a cycle or two before washing dishes.

How do I get more information?

If you have any further questions, you can contact the Mississippi State Department of Health Bureau of Public Water Supply by calling (601) 576-7518.

8,"Mar 8, 2021",The Clarion-Ledger,Water crisis Day 20: Mayor to meet with EPA; water in Jackson still unsafe to drink,"CLOSE Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba discusses the city's water issues. Mississippi Clarion Ledger

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba was expected to meet Monday with Environmental Protection Agency officials to request federal funding as the capital city's unprecedented water crisis nears its fourth week.

City officials continue to say water pressure is being restored, but shared no data to show any progress. In some pockets of the city, largely among those on higher elevations, residents are still experiencing little to no water pressure.

The drinking water in Jackson is still unsafe to drink. The city remains under a citywide boil notice first issued on Feb. 16.

Testing has revealed the city's water contains high levels of turbidity, or cloudiness, which increases the chance the water may contain disease-causing organisms.

Public Works Director Charles Williams on Monday said the notice could be lifted for some areas of the city possibly Thursday once the city's water tanks were full and sampling could take place. The Mississippi State Department of Health has given the city the go-ahead to begin testing, he said.

Williams said about 95% of the city's approximately 43,000 water customers now have water. He did not provide a specific number of residents still dealing with an outage, adding a majority of those still without water live off Forest Hill and McCluer roads in south Jackson.

Meanwhile, Lumumba and city officials continue to scramble to solicit state and federal funding as the notice extends into a third week.

Lumumba said Friday the EPA has been responsive for possible federal relief for the city's troubled water system.

The City Council last week approved a request from the mayor's office to apply for a grant from the EPA that could bring in $500,000, according to the EPA.

Also last week, Lumumba sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves requesting about $47 million in state and federal funds.

Water distribution sites in Jackson

The city released an updated list of distribution sites for non-potable and bottled water on Monday.

Atoa said more distribution sites for bottled water could come and city leaders will notify residents when water is available.

Non-potable water will be available at the following location from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m Monday:

Forest Hill High School – 2607 Raymond Rd.

City officials will be handing out bottled water until it runs out Monday. The distribution will begin at 3 p.m.

Metrocenter Mall - 3645 HWY 80 (3 p.m. until supplies run out)

Water main breaks

The city said it will provide an updated list of water main breaks sometime Monday. Atoa said the number of breaks is back within the range of what the city anticipates on a regular basis.

The city says it is still overwhelmed by calls to 311. It advises residents to reserve calls to the city hotline for water main breaks.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

Water billing

The city is advising residents who have experienced a significant leak or loss of water due to a plumbing issue or busted pipes to keep copies of repair statements and to submit them to the Water and Sewer Business Administration for consideration of an adjustment to the bill.

To qualify, the city advises residents bring a copy of the receipt or a receipt for parts to the Water and Sewer Business Administration. Residents can call 601-960-2000 for additional information.

9,"Mar 6, 2021",NBC News,"Jackson, Mississippi has a water crisis because our state legislature has a race problem","Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves told the media this week, “I do think it's really important that the City of Jackson start collecting their water bill payments before they start going and asking everyone else to pony up more money.""

As the governor gave that lecture on March 3 in his state’s capital city, thousands of homes near where he sat in Jackson were without even non-potable water to flush their toilets, and not a single home in the city limits had access to safe drinking water we could use without boiling first.

The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann threw out a telling statement of his own when he criticized the poverty-stricken city for not fixing its own water system, adding, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?”

Mayor Ditto's final term in office ended in 1997; people born during it are old enough to buy alcohol these days.

The real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

For people not steeped in Mississippi politics, Ditto — not coincidentally — was Jackson’s last white mayor before white-flight demographic shifts brought Harvey Johnson Jr., an urban planner and infrastructure wonk who devoted $200 million to the problem, to office. Johnson warned repeatedly of a future breakdown of our aging systems in Jackson, including around the state Capitol where Reeves and Hosemann had the temerity to lecture us. This was a system, it’s worth noting, that was not exactly handed over to Black leadership in pristine shape, with nary a crack or challenge. It was already in trouble then.

But white state leadership at the time and ever since — including those whose families left Jackson after the forced desegregation of schools in early 1970 — have typically responded to the city’s Black leaders with contempt, blank stares or condescension.

The immediate cause of the broad, systemic breakdown of Jackson’s water system was the same unprecedented cold-weather spell for which Texas received national attention in February. But the real causes of Jackson's problems are deeper and more sinister and cost much more than a neglected city can recoup by collecting on late water bills.

Still, as my reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, Nick Judin, and I understood — because he and I grew up in the area — Reeves and Hosemann's words augured back to a long-held talking point and belief among many white Mississippians: Black leaders just aren’t competent. And the people who elect them deserve what they get.

In the last couple days, we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and help its capital city through this water crisis.

It’s not like this belittlement tactic is accidental. It dates back to a time when Jackson was a wealthy white center of power for the state — until the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954 started upending the white-supremacist status quo. Jackson political and business leaders panicked at the thought of integrated schools — and children of different races getting to know and respect each other (gasp) — as well as the prospect of Black people voting, holding top offices and ordering their sandwiches at the city's lunch counters instead of the cafes' backdoors.

So, via the racist Citizens’ Councils that soon spread across the U.S. as far west as San Francisco, the elites in Jackson started marketing three old and intertwined ideas, as Jackson historian Stephanie Rolph details in her book “Resisting Equality: The Citizens’ Council, 1954-1989.” First, they pushed that Black people were born inferior; second, that their supposed inferiority meant they couldn’t run things well; and third, that they are constitutionally prone to crime.

All this rhetoric has helped drive businesses and residents out of Jackson from the 1950s to this day, despite zero evidence for any of the vicious lies.

Still, the racist Citizens Councils' putrid ideas stuck around, influencing many in and outside Mississippi. The myths were and are assisted by every possible effort to ensure that Black people — who have been redlined and discriminated out of the same wealth-generation avenues that white people had enjoyed since slavery was legal — could not prove them wrong. Much of that has come in the form of withholding the financial resources necessary for the basic running and maintenance of, say, a capital city, its public schools and its water and sewer systems.

Be very clear: white wealth didn’t just take its money and stomp out into suburban developments (formerly known as cow pastures) to leave Black cities behind. It has, in fact, done everything possible to burn down what they couldn't take with them — a 20th century Sherman's march out of American cities, if you will.

Whether those in power have bothered to face our history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

Many of the same prominent whites who proudly attended well-funded public schools in Jackson before integration have, since abandoning the city, done everything possible to limit even “adequate” urban school funding or to redirect the money to legacy segregation academies — now usually called “private Christian academies.” They use the state legislature to control how much Jackson can tax our own citizens in order to pay for our own needs. They won’t support desperately needed flood mitigation for the city — unless it provides rich white people with valuable waterfront development. And Medicaid expansion in the time of Covid-19? Forget about it.

White state politicians are even trying to steal one of the few major revenue generators Jackson has left. In 2016, white Mississippi Republicans began a naked attempt to take over the Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport — a name, by the way, that still displeases some of the Old Guard — by passing legislation to replace its city-appointed commissioners with a state-appointed governing board, only two of whom would come from Jackson. Black legislators called the move “Jim Crow legislation.” Primary sponsors of the bill didn’t try to hide that they have real-estate interests in the whiter suburban areas just outside the airport gates.

Oh, and their continual excuse for taking it? The airport leaders aren’t up to the task of managing it. (I’ll allow you to imagine the race of those highly qualified professionals.)

On Thursday night, I co-moderated a Jackson mayoral debate in which Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba recounted that Lt. Gov. Hosemann had offered him financial help for the city — an insulting $30 million — if he would drop a lawsuit that has forestalled the theft of the airport to date. Lumumba said no, of course.

The dignity for which Jacksonians are asking includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

In the last couple days — since Hosemann’s Ditto comment — we’ve seen the first possible signs that the state of Mississippi is going to grow past its old Citizens Council-era thinking and actually help its capital city through this water crisis: They are now in discussions about financial assistance of at least $47 million.

Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers. Whether those who engage in that thinking have bothered to face that history or not, it is the state of Mississippi’s role to help fix this problem.

I get it, though: A racist political machine raised many white Mississippians to believe they were simply superior at running things, over any given Black leader in the state. They look at the world through white-tinged glasses and believe their power and wealth, or any power or wealth they might eventually be able to amass, is dependent on scrapping over scarcity. They think they don’t or won't get theirs if they treat the majority-Black capital city, its leaders and its residents with the respect and dignity our citizens deserve.

That dignity for which Jacksonians are asking, though, includes clear drinking water, pipes without lead and toilets that flush for everyone, regardless of race.

It’s long, long past time to put Citizens Council-era propaganda to rest and treat Black leaders and Black Mississipians like equals, not like pawns in yet another white power game.","The Monday before Reeves’ flippant remark about the majority-Black capital city, Lt. Gov.

10,"Mar 17, 2021",Mississippi Today,Poll: Most Mississippians believe state has an obligation to help with Jackson water crisis,"More than half of Mississippians believe the state has an obligation to help Jackson and its residents with the current water crisis, according to a poll released Wednesday.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and tens of thousands of residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, city officials say most residents have had water service restored, though the entire city is still under a boil water notice.

The ongoing water crisis is the result of decades of inaction from city leaders, who put off routine maintenance and meaningful infrastructure repairs as the city’s tax base and revenue collections diminished. Current and former city leaders, having dealt for decades with aging and brittle pipes, say they need investment from the state and federal government.

A poll from Millsaps College and Chism Strategies released on Wednesday found that 55.3% of those polled believe the state needs to help the city repair its water system, while 29.5% did not and 15.2% were unsure. There was less of a consensus over where the funding for repairing the capital city’s water system should come from. Of those surveyed, 33.2% believe funding should come from a combination of federal, state and local tax dollars. Those who believe funding should come from Jackson’s city government alone came in a close second, making up 32.6% of survey responses. The poll also found that 16.4% believe funding should come from the federal government alone, while 11.4% said it should be the state government and 6.7% were unsure.

There are proposals at the federal, state and local levels that would direct funding towards Jackson’s water infrastructure.

On Tuesday, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced legislation that would tap three federal agencies to provide Jackson with a combination of loans, loan forgiveness and grants for water infrastructure projects.

State lawmakers are currently weighing their options for getting funding to Jackson before the end of the 2021 legislative session. The options being considered include issuing $47 million in state bonds to the city for emergency repairs to its water system. A bill is also making its way through the Legislature that, if approved by lawmakers and Jackson voters, would increase the city’s sales tax by 1 cent and generate an estimated $14 million per year for water infrastructure projects. The legislature could also reconvene later in 2021 to appropriate Mississippi’s share of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last week, and some of that money could be funneled to Jackson.

14,"Feb 16, 2021",WJTV,"Jackson neighbors experience low water pressure, city-wide boil water alert issued","JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Due to the extreme cold weather and low temperatures, Jackson leaders said the city’s water treatment plants are experiencing an inability to maintain pressure in the distribution system. Until adequate system pressure is restored, some areas may experience low to no water pressure.

The City of Jackson Water/Sewer Utilities Division has issued city-wide precautionary boil water advisory until further notice. The advisory affects 43,000 customers to the city’s drinking water system. The notice is for:

All surface water connections

This notice does not include well water connections

On Thursday, the city announced all well connections on the City of Jackson’s drinking water system were placed under a boil water notice.

All customers are advised to boil their drinking water until adequate pressure is restored to the system. Water should be brought to a rolling boil for one minute for the following: cooking or baking, making ice cubes, taking medication, brushing teeth, washing food, mixing baby formula or food, mixing juices or drinks feeding pets, washing dishes and all other consumption.

The city is encouraging neighbors to do their best to conserve water and call 311 or any of the numbers below to report low water pressure or no water at their home or business. Neighbors are also asked to report any visible water main breaks in the distribution system.

15,"Feb 17, 2021",Houston Chronicle,"'How does that happen?': Water crisis unfolding in Houston amid power outages, frozen pipes","Millions of Houstonians awoke Wednesday to a notice from the city that their water was unsafe to drink unless boiled, an impossible task for many residents who continued to suffer power outages from the winter storm.

A large chunk of Houston households had already lost water pressure altogether or had seen their pipes freeze, preventing access to the city’s water system. The crisis extended to key facilities, depriving hospitals and the Harris County Jail of running water. Houston Methodist canceled most non-urgent surgeries and procedures due to the water shortage and may do so again Thursday, a spokeswoman said.

Houston officials predicted water pressure will return to operational levels by the end of the day Thursday, though the boil water notice will extend longer, as state law requires cities to continue testing water samples for 24 hours before the notice can be lifted.

The plummeting water pressure was the result of bursting pipes across the city and equipment failures at water distribution facilities due to frigid weather conditions, said Carol Haddock, director of Houston Public Works. Under the boil water notice, residents are advised to use only boiled or bottled water for drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. City officials said residents can safely shower as long as they avoid ingesting any water.

The water shortages caught many Houstonians off guard, even those who had tried to prepare for the winter storm.

Caralena Morales took several precautions ahead of Wednesday’s outages, finding candles and flashlights, stocking food, filling a bath tub with water for flushing toilets. The family, however, did not plan on losing running water. As a result, Morales and her 19-year-old son, Esteban, spent 45 minutes waiting in line Wednesday morning outside a Spring Branch H-E-B to buy four cases of water.

Morales, 35, said she mostly blamed herself for the oversight, though she questioned why her home lacked water when her pipes did not freeze.

“We went from water to no water to a trickle to no water,” Morales, 35, said, sighing when she learned the city issued a boil advisory Wednesday morning. “How does that happen? We knew it was going to be this cold.”

Virtually the entire Houston area came under some form of the water crisis, with surrounding municipalities also issuing boil water notices to residents who largely lacked water access. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said county residents should assume they need to boil water “unless they’ve heard otherwise.”

Frigid temperatures prevented backup generators across Houston’s water system from kicking on during the power outage, a crucial problem in a city that relies on pumps rather than water towers to generate pressure. Treatment plants also were running below capacity in part because the chemicals used to purify the water were not behaving normally, Haddock said.

Beginning around lunchtime Tuesday, pressure in much of the city dipped below 20 pounds per square inch, the threshold below which the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality requires that a boil notice be issued, as low pressure increases the risk that contaminants can force their way into the pipes.

“By yesterday evening, it became apparent to us that we were not going to be able to recover those pressures, and that is why we issued the boil water notice this morning,” Haddock said.

Temperatures rose above freezing Wednesday and Haddock said crews began returning to service some pumps that had been taken offline for maintenance scheduled during the typically low-demand winter months.

In Galveston, officials shut off the city’s water supply and issued a boil water notice Wednesday morning after burst pipes and major water line breaks from the storm strained the city’s water supply. The city’s main water supplier, the Gulf Coast Water Authority, separately lost massive amounts of water due to bursting pipes, reducing flow to the island and causing demand to exceed supply.

Baytown officials brought the city’s water plant back online and began filling its storage tanks Wednesday afternoon, the city announced in a news release. Some residents were expected to begin seeing a gradual increase in water pressure by early evening, but it will likely take a few days for the system to return to normal, according to the city.

Water issues also disrupted school districts around the Houston area, including Cy-Fair ISD, where officials said several schools have “major” water damage and about a dozen campuses lost all food in their buildings. Officials from Klein ISD, which joined Houston and Katy ISDs in announcing class cancellations through the end of the week, cited “weather-related challenges including damages to school buildings.”

Some hospitals, meanwhile, were dealing with low water pressure but had seen minimal interruptions to normal business. Facilities with water issues included Baylor St. Luke’s Medical Center campus and Texas Children’s Hospital’s campuses at the Medical Center and in west Houston.

A more dire situation unfolded as pipes burst at Houston Methodist hospitals across the area and two locations — Baytown and west Houston — were operating without water altogether. Those two hospitals still were “managing to meet essential needs of the community,” a spokeswoman said.

City officials were working to provide water to various hospitals across the area. The Houston Fire Department sent water to Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, and the city dipped into its water supply for irrigating parks to provide water to other hospitals.

Mayor Sylvester Turner, who said a pipe had burst in his own home, also asked grocery store chains to send water to hospitals if they can.

“We’re all working together, just like we’ve done before, pulling resources from wherever they exist, and then sharing those resources,” Turner said.

16,"Feb 19, 2021",ABC News,"No 'definitive timeline' when water will return to Jackson, Mississippi: Mayor","""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Jackson's public works director said.

As power and water outages rock the South, among the hard-hit cities is Jackson, Mississippi, where most residents face little to no water pressure.

""We do not have a definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks,"" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday. ""We are continuing to pump into the tanks and we are continuing to try to recover.""

""This becomes increasingly challenging"" due to the pandemic, Lumumba said, because so many residents are at home instead of school, which means people are trying to use water at a higher rate than usual.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the length of the cold snap in Jackson has taken a toll on the water production.

""Hopefully by this weekend you will start seeing some pressure build back up and water will slowly be restored,"" Williams said Thursday, adding that it's difficult to give a timeline because the weather impacts are ""unpredictable.""

""We continue to ask for your patience,"" Williams said. ""We're working around the clock.""

On Friday, Williams told reporters there was some progress in the city's water pressure, but it was still hard to predict when people will get their water back. Those who live closer to the city's two water plants should expect to have water sooner than those who live farther away, he said.

Water main breaks are another concern; as of Friday afternoon, there were 13 in the city, with more expected as the ice and snow melts, Williams said.

""We hope that it does not increase very much because that will delay some of the recovery process,"" he said.

A boil water notice was issued Thursday.

Jackson officials are offering water distribution at several sites Friday.

Besides the water emergency, between 18,000 to 19,000 customers in Jackson were without power Thursday, largely due to limbs falling on power lines as a result of freezing rain, the mayor said.

Lumumba warned that roads are still topped with ice and urged caution while driving to get basic necessities.

""This is the time ... to help one another, especially our most vulnerable constituents,"" City Council President Aaron Banks said.

After a week of historic and disastrous snow, ice and cold in the South, the freezing temperatures will soon lift. A hard freeze warning is in effect in Mississippi Friday morning but temperatures are expected to rise this weekend.

Jackson State coach Deion Sanders is all in on the city of Jackson.

The first-year coach told local reporters Saturday that the Tigers' 33-27 win over Grambling State was for the capital city of the Magnolia State.

Many citizens have gone almost three weeks without clean water since winter storms swept the area.

STATEMANT MADE: Deion Sanders proves something to all of us in statement win at Grambling

""The city of Jackson, Mississippi and I want you to get this,"" Sanders said. ""This city of Jackson, Mississippi is so resilient. Do you know what we've been up against? The city. With the water problems and electrical problems and some of the elderly not receiving water, not being able to bathe. We got our butts out there and went to a nursing home this week to make sure they had water. They're so resilient, and no one's complaining. To have the city ride like that, and we just give them a little more hope, we got you. We got you. We're going to ride with you as well.""

Sanders brought up Jackson twice again unprompted before the end of the press conference. He compared his team's effort to close out a game to the city's residents. Saturday's matchup came down to the final two minutes as Grambling State was on JSU's goal line before the reigning SWAC Defensive Player of the Year came up with a fumble recovery to seal the victory.

""I learned that these guys are resilient, just like the city of Jackson. They're resilient,"" Sanders said. ""They really are, and they won't give up. They got fight in them.""

WINNER, WINNER: Jackson State football gives Deion Sanders first SWAC victory with wild win over Grambling State

'THEY LIFTED THEIR OWN EXPECTATION:' Deion Sanders says Jackson State looks good ahead of Grambling

JSU (2-0, 1-0 SWAC) wasted little time getting back to campus after Saturday's win, as players weren't available to speak with the local media postgame to get back sooner. After celebrating the win this weekend, the attention shifts to the Tigers' next opponent, which is in-state rival Mississippi Valley State.

""Jackson, Mississippi,"" Sanders said before he pumped his fists. ""Jackson State, Thee I Love. I love it. Quote me on that.""

Kick off against the Delta Devils is at 1 p.m. on March 14 at Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium.

18,"Feb 19, 2021",Philadelphia Inquirer,Texas winter storm: Power outages dwindle but water crisis lingers,"AUSTIN, Texas — Southern cities slammed by winter storms that l eft millions without power for days have traded one crisis for another: Busted water pipes ruptured by record-low temperatures created shortages of clean drinking water, shut down the Memphis airport on Friday and left hospitals struggling to maintain sanitary conditions.

In Texas, 7 million people — a quarter of the population of the nation’s second-largest state — were under orders to boil tap water before drinking it because low water pressure could have allowed bacteria to seep into the system. A man died at in an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

About 260,000 homes and businesses in Tennessee’s largest county, which includes Memphis, were told to boil water because of water main ruptures and problems at pumping stations. Restaurants that can’t do so or don’t have bottled water were ordered to close. And water pressure problems prompted Memphis International Airport to cancel all incoming and outgoing Friday flights.

In Jackson, Mississippi, most of the city of about 161,000 had no running water. Crews pumped water to refill city tanks but faced a shortage of chemicals for treatment because icy roads made it difficult for distributors to deliver them, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

He said the city’s water mains are more than 100 years old and not built to handle the freezing weather that hit the city as multiple storms dumped record amounts of snow across the South.

“We are dealing with an extreme challenge with getting more water through our distribution system,” said Lumumba.

The city was providing water for flushing toilets and drinking, but residents had to pick it up, leaving the elderly and those living on icy roads vulnerable.

Lisa Thomas said her driveway on a hill in Jackson was a sheet of ice. Her husband, who is on a defibrillator and heart monitor, has only enough heart medication to get him through Sunday because she hasn’t been able to go to the pharmacy.

» READ MORE: After up to 10 inches of snow in the Philly area; sleet, freezing drizzle, and icy roads persisted into the night

“People are in dire need here,” Thomas said.

Paul Lee Davis got to the front of the line at a water station set up by city officials only to have the water run out. He was still waiting for it to be replenished three and a have hours after he arrived.

“We need water, the stores all are out. I don’t see what choice we have,” Davis said.

The water woes were the latest misery for residents left without heat or electricity for days after the ice and snow storms earlier in the week, forcing rolling blackouts from Minnesota to Texas.

Texas electrical grid operators said Friday that transmission had returned to normal for the first time since historic snowfall and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity to warm up home — buckling the state’s power grid and causing the widespread blackouts.

Smaller outages remained, but Bill Magness, president of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, said the grid now can provide power throughout the entire system.

Gov. Greg Abbott ordered an investigation into the failure for a state known as the U.S. energy capital. ERCOT officials have defended their preparations and the decision to begin forced outages Monday as the grid reached a breaking point.

The storms also left more than 330,000 from Virginia to Louisiana without power. About 70,000 in Oregon on Friday were still enduring a weeklong outage following a massive ice and snow storm. Oregon’s governor ordered the National Guard to go door-to-door in the hardest-hit areas to ensure residents have enough food and water.

The extreme weather was blamed for the deaths of at least 70 people, including people struggling to get warm and a Tennessee farmer who tried to save two calves that apparently wandered onto a frozen pond.

Federal Emergency Management Agency acting administrator Bob Fenton said teams in Texas were distributing fuel, water, blankets and other supplies.

“What has me most worried is making sure that people stay warm,” Fenton said on “CBS This Morning.”

In many areas, water pressure dropped after lines froze and because people left faucets dripping to prevent pipes from icing, authorities said.

As of Friday afternoon, more than 1,300 Texas public water systems and 159 counties had reported weather-related operational disruptions affecting more than 14.9 million people, according to Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokeswoman Tiffany Young.

More than 1 million gallons (3.8 million liters) of water was being trucked Friday to the Texas capital. But Austin’s water director, Greg Maszaros, implored residents to minimize the use of home faucets because “there’s still a lot of unknowns as we pressurize the system.”

In Dallas, David Lopez said the plumbing company he works for received more than 600 calls for service over the last week.

“It’s pretty much first come, first served,” said Lopez, as he and a colleague manhandled a new water heater out of their van on Friday. “Everyone’s got emergencies.”

Houston residents probably will have to boil tap water in the fourth-largest U.S. city until Sunday or Monday, said Mayor Sylvester Turner.

Water service was restored Friday to two Houston Methodist community hospitals, but officials still were bringing in drinking water and some elective surgeries were canceled, spokeswoman Gale Smith said.

St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis said it was forced to switch to bottled water and bagged ice for all consumption and that staff and patients were washing with hand sanitizer and no-rinse bathing wipes. All non-urgent surgeries were postponed.

Central Arkansas Water, which services the Little Rock area, asked customers to conserve water to help protect its system as the ground began to warm and pipes thawed. The city of Hot Springs warned Thursday night that its water supply was “critically low” and also asked customers to conserve.

In Little Rock, the Museum of Discovery reported that a broken pipe flooded its building — causing extensive damage to theaters, galleries and offices and killing one display animal, a blue-tongued skink lizard.

More than 192,000 Louisiana residents -- some still struggling to recover from last August’s Hurricane Laura -- had no water service Friday, according to the state health department. Tens of thousands more remained under boil-water advisories.

Bulk and bottled water deliveries were planned Friday to the hardest-hit Louisiana areas with a focus on hospitals, nursing homes and dialysis centers, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said, adding that he was hopeful that warmer weather expected during the weekend would speed up repairs.

In the community of Hackberry, near Lake Charles, Louisiana, Nicole Beard said her boyfriend crawled under his house to try to fix a broken water line but couldn’t because he didn’t have the right parts and it was too dark. She was using bottled water and sent her two daughters to stay at another home.

“People are still just struggling over here,” she said.","A man died at in an Abilene health care facility when a lack of water pressure made medical treatment impossible.

20,"Mar 1, 2021",The Clarion-Ledger,"Jackson water crisis: Crews still working to restore pressure, fix water main breaks","City officials are continuing efforts to restore water to some pockets of Jackson Monday, nearly two weeks after winter storms affected the region.

During a news conference Monday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said the city's water system is still in the process of stabilizing itself. Pressure was near optimum levels on Sunday, but that has since fallen, Williams said.

Residents in south Jackson and some western pockets of the city still have little to no service as of Monday. Williams said he's aware people are suffering, but wanted to stress that crews are working as hard as they can to get water flowing to those areas.

""We understand the frustration, we understand the complaints,"" he said. ""We did not expect this to happen, but we're dealing with the aftermath of it.""

There is still no definitive timeline on when service will be fully restored, Williams said.

City officials could also not confirm how many residents remain without water in the city. Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said that because Jackson is on a legacy water system, it cannot pinpoint where outages are and how many customers are affected in that area.

""We only know there are outages because people call them in,"" she said.

Residents on Jackson's water system are still under a boil water advisory and are asked to conserve water when possible until full service is restored throughout the city.

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Sunday.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.:

Forest Hill High School – 2607 Raymond Road, Jackson

Raines Elementary School – 156 N. Flag Chapel Road, Jackson

Callaway High School – 601 Beasley Road, Jackson

Provine High School – 2400 Robinson St., Jackson

New Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church – 140 Maple St., Jackson

Davis Road Park – 5901 Terry Road, Byram

Walton Elementary School – 3200 Bailey Ave., Jackson

The city is also continuing to deliver bottled water to residents who are elderly, disabled or homebound.

Although bottled water is also being offered at some locations, when that water is available varies by day.

Atoa said several city departments are involved in water pickup and delivery to sites. The heavy machinery used to move pallets of water require qualified personnel to operate, so city workers are being asked to help when possible, she said.

""The bottled water is a little bit more of a moving target compared to the non-potable water,"" Atoa said. ""That's why we're not putting out specific times, because it relies on so many different logistics.""

Bottled water was available at the New Mt. Zion, Forrest Hill High School, Provine High School and Davis Road Park locations by midday Monday. Atoa said the water will be available until supplies are gone.

On Monday, the New Orleans Pelicans basketball team announced they will be sending two shipments of bottled water to the city of Jackson. Distribution will be handled by city officials, according to the release.

From a team official: Pelicans “are donating 2 shipments of bottled water to the residents of Jackson, MS due to the ongoing water crisis. The two truckloads will be delivered within 24 hours and distribution of the cases of bottled water will be handled by the city of Jackson.” https://t.co/UOgLgb6z4Y — Andrew Lopez (@_Andrew_Lopez) March 1, 2021

Water main repairs continue

As of Sunday evening, at least 80 water main breaks and leaks have been reported in the city since the winter storms hit on Feb. 14. City officials said 51 breaks have been repaired so far and 29 other breaks are currently under review.

Residents are encouraged to call 311 to report any additional breaks.

The Water System Business Administration is also offering residents a chance to have their bills adjusted due to the storm. Anyone who has experienced loss of service or broken pipes due to the storm will need to submit copies of their repair bills to be considered for an adjustment.

Residents with additional questions can call the agency at 601-960-2000 for more information.

Solis/AP Lamar Jackson, left, stacks bottled water brought by Mac Epps of Mississippi Move at a senior residence in Jackson, Mississippi, on Feb. 22, 2021. Rising temperatures have melted the snow and ice in Mississippi, but tens of thousands of people still had little or no water service.

Frigid temperatures and torrential snowfall have largely left the South after a cold front gripped the region weeks ago, but some cities are still facing dire infrastructure failures caused by the cold and their state’s lack of preparation.

Most of the people suffering the most untenable circumstances ― including a now weekslong water shortage in Mississippi ― are in predominantly Black and brown communities, and their experiences offer a grim look at the reality of racial inequality under the worsening global climate crisis.

When the extreme cold first touched the South in mid-February, Texas officials ― specifically, Texas Republicans ― were roundly criticized for their long-standing opposition to weatherizing the state’s power supply, a progressive energy priority. But widespread infrastructure failures during and after the cold front weren’t confined to Texas.

In recent days, Jackson, Mississippi, has also come into national focus as some parts of the majority-Black city enter day 13 of a water shortage caused by main breaks. Jackson is nearly 80% Black and has nearly 170,000 residents. Those using the city’s water system have been on a boil water advisory for the past week, meaning the city has advised them that water main breaks caused by the cold have left some areas with no water, low water pressure or potentially toxic material traveling through the pipes. Officials in the state and private donors have been distributing bottled water to help residents weather the shortage.

Rogelio V. Solis/AP Mississippi Army National Guard Sgt. Chase Toussaint fills five-gallon buckets with nonpotable water at the New Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church parking lot on March 1, 2021. Water for flushing toilets was being distributed at seven sites in Mississippi's capital more than 10 days after winter storms wreaked havoc on the city's water system, which is still struggling to maintain consistent water pressure, authorities said.

Just as in Texas, the cold has left Jackson’s infrastructure crumbling, reigniting historic debates over energy, climate and race in an agriculture-dependent state whose predominantly white power brokers wield control over much of the land.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba (D) said on NBC Monday afternoon that his city’s water mains are “not meant to withstand weather in the teens” and that weatherizing them costs “hundreds of millions of dollars, of which the city of Jackson does not have in its coffers.”

Lumumba called on the Mississippi legislature and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves to allocate funds to support Jackson’s faltering water system, and he condemned a veto Reeves issued last year blocking legislation proposed to help Jacksonians pay for their water bills. Lumumba said Monday the governor’s veto and some lawmakers’ resistance to improving the water system is impacting the recovery effort now.

“We are in a reactive mode where we’re trying to fix the bike while we’re riding it,” he said.

Lumumba recently called the crisis an “act of God” and defended his administration’s handling of the ongoing water shortage on Monday. Reeves, meanwhile, said Jackson would be provided with tankers of nonpotable water to “jumpstart the system.”

Last Tuesday, Reeves dispatched the National Guard to Jackson, saying troops would “complete the mission” to restore clean water in the city. In the past week, Reeves also floated the possibility that his administration could take the controversial step of giving Mississippi state control over Jackson’s water system.","Rogelio V.

23,1 month ago,Connect FM,"Jackson, Mississippi has an ongoing water crisis. Here’s how it’s impacting its citizens.","turk_stock_photographer/iStock

(JACKSON, Miss.) — When winter storms swept throughout the South in mid-February, millions of people lost power and water for days. One of the cities hit hardest was Jackson, Mississippi.

The capital city of Mississippi went without clean water for nearly a month. Some Jackson residents who spoke with ABC News said they have had no running water in their homes for up to three weeks.

This is not the first time there has been a water problem in Jackson. Aging infrastructure of the city’s water pipes, changes in weather patterns and lack of resources, have contributed to inconsistent access to clean water for decades.

“They said … you experienced the water crisis recently. I would actually argue that we’re still in the midst of a water crisis,” Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said. “It’s not a matter of, if it’s a matter of when it will fail again, until we get the adequate resources to address it.”

After the storms, Lumumba submitted a $47 million proposal to the state to receive funding to repair infrastructure. In 2014, the citizens of Jackson also voted to enforce a 1% sales tax to provide more money for infrastructure, which Lumumba says brings in around $13 million a year.

However, Lumumba told ABC News, “this is just a starting point.” He said repairing all of Jackson’s infrastructure would cost nearly $2 billion.

President Joe Biden addressed the nation’s infrastructure needs and proposed a “once-in-a-generation” $2 trillion infrastructure plan that would fix several looming infrastructure issues across the country. Among them would be replacing all lead pipes carrying drinking water.

“I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years, people are going to look back and say, ‘This was the moment that America won the future,’” Biden said.

Jackson has an over 82% Black population, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Lumumba said environmental racism, divestment and white flight all play a part in the city’s infrastructure crisis.

“I think that you find less willingness from the state to support a city like Jackson, because they don’t necessarily feel that the demographics of Jackson, or even the politics of Jackson resemble the majority opinion,” Lumumba said. “We have to understand that these aren’t Democratic or Republican issues. These are our human issues.”

Four citizens of Jackson spoke with ABC News’s Good Morning America about the impact of the city’s water crisis.

Coach Rod McKee

Rod McKee has been a teacher and football coach at Wingfield High School in south Jackson, Mississippi for four years. He said water problems not only impacted his students during this year’s winter storms — but have impacted them every year he has taught in the school..

“All four years we’ve experienced kids having to be out of school due to a water outage caused by the school pipes bursting from being too old,” McKee said. “The school extends school hours from eight to four to make up hours and days in case we have a water crisis, which I feel like is unfair to the students.”

McKee said when the water goes out at school meals are replaced by sack lunches. With extended hours, students may have only having eaten one sack lunch, he said.

While there have been recurring problems throughout the years with water and education, the winter storm that swept Jackson, brought the most severe problems McKee said he has seen in the city.

“I had students that went a month without water,” McKee said. “On top of being home quarantined, and have to learn virtually, that’s the last thing I want to do is put pressure on them about a class…It was a lot.”

McKee said the school hosted water drives that turned into food drives during this winter’s crisis. Many businesses around the area stepped up to deliver hot plates to people who couldn’t cook or wash their dishes, he said.

McKee said that he and his family had their own struggles. He had to place a trashcan in his driveway to catch ice so enough water would melt for his family to be able to flush their toilets, he told ABC News.

“It should’ve never gotten to this point. There’s enough resources. This is America,” McKee said.

Danyelle Holmes

Danyelle Holmes, a Jackson resident since 1991 and a national organizer with the Poor People’s Campaign, was on the ground helping out her fellow Jackson residents after the storm this winter.

Holmes told ABC News that her group focused on not only handing out clean water, but also giving a stipend to Jackson residents for the work they were doing in the community.

“We gave out over 100,000 cases of water over the state of Mississippi,” Holmes said. “Just in the city of Jackson we gave out close to $100,000. Our assistance is still going on.”

While this water crisis was amplified by the winter storm, Holmes said there have always been water issues in Jackson. In the 30 years she has lived in the city, she said she has never drunk water out of the tap.

“It’s always brown. Even at my home having brown water is normal,” Holmes said. “I’ve always relied on bottled or filtered water.”

Holmes said the water issues come from years of infrastructure issues in Jackson and she hopes the magnitude of the water outages caused by this year’s winter storm will bring light to the improvements the city needs.

“It took the negligence on our leadership on just not really investing into the capital. The very city they have to come to to handle their business has been neglected for years,” Holmes said. “This winter storm had to happen in order to expose … what’s actually going on what’s still going on in the state of Mississippi.”

Willie William

Willie William has lived in Jackson, Mississippi, since 2000 and three years ago started his own local business — a food truck called Scherria’s Chicken Coop.

During the water crisis, William was hired by World Central Kitchen to make hot plates for many in the community who didn’t have food. Each week for three weeks, William made 2,000 to 3,000 hot meals to deliver to people in the community.

William was more than happy to help, but after a year of dealing with the pandemic, the water crisis made business harder for him.

“It makes the work ten times harder. You have to boil the water when you’re doing everything,” William said. “I buy five-gallon water jugs to cook out because the water is still not safe. It makes it difficult for your customer base too because you have to change a lot of the menu items … When the pandemic came the numbers for food weren’t up so we had to change the prices on our menu.”

While the water crisis impacted William as a small business owner, as a Jackson citizen water issues have become a part of life.

“There’s been numerous times the water has been low pressure or sometimes the rusted water,” William said. “The water system is very old here. It needs to be replaced and that’s something that’s understood. But that’s going to take a lot of funding, something we probably don’t have in the budget.”

William hopes that this winter’s crisis and awareness of the problem inspires change, but until then, he said, the members of the Jackson community will each do their part to help.

“Jackson is a violent city right now but there’s a lot of people here that still care and just try to give back and do what we can,” William said. “We’re one tight-knit community.”

Pastor Arthur Sutton

Arthur Sutton, a pastor at Progressive M.B. Church, has lived in Jackson for 52 years. When the water ran dry after the winter storms on Feb. 16, he said he had never seen anything like that before.

“I have never seen it like this before,” Sutton said. “I was without water, no pressure, nothing for 17 days. When the water came back on we had to wait a minute because of the different types of debris and substances inside the water ..when you boiled your water the stuff was still there.”

As a pastor, Sutton wasn’t just worried for himself but for all the members of his church. When other Baptists churches across the country heard about the water crisis in Jackson, they began reaching out to Sutton to send his church water.

“We’ve probably given out close to 100 of more pallets of water. Most pallets come with 60 to 84 cases of water,” Sutton said. “That’s a lot of water.”

Sutton said many members of his church were elderly and unable to pick up water for themselves, so they set up a delivery service.

“It was bad, I’m going to be honest with you,” Sutton said. “It hurts when everybody else starts getting water and you’re the last to get water.”

Sutton says officials need to communicate and assure the citizens of Jackson that they will not have to deal with a crisis like this in the future.

“What they need to do is they need to get together and talk and communicate where this does not happen again,” Sutton says. “Whatever funding that we need, we need to get it and we can go ahead and repair our infrastructure…to where if something happens that these people can still get water.”

Government and the environment

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says that while over 93% of Americans have water from community water systems that meet all health standards, there are improvements to be made.

“EPA understands that more work needs to be done so that everyone in the United States has access to safe water that meets EPA’s standards – no matter the color of their skin, money on their pocket, or zip code,” EPA Senior Public Affairs Specialist Cathy Milbourn said in a statement.

According to the EPA, over $743 billion is needed for water infrastructure improvements in the Untied States.

To date, EPA’s State Revolving Funds have provided more than $189 billion in assistance for nearly 43,000 water quality infrastructure projects and 16,500 drinking water projects. In the past two years, these State Revolving Funds have also created over 300,000 jobs.

President Biden has proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure overhaul, the American Jobs Plan. Part of the plan proposes eliminating “all lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems, improving the health of our country’s children and communities of color,” the plan states on the White House website.

Many Republicans have signaled they don’t support the proposal but Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said on ABC’s This Week that the GOP is willing to negotiate on a smaller package.

While cities like Jackson continue to fight for funding at both the state and federal levels, Jackson Mayor Lumumba encourages people who want to help their community to donate money to philanthropic causes set up to help with the water crisis.

“In the midst of people being without running water in their homes we had a number of good Samaritans from not only across the city but across the country,” Lumumba said.

Lumumba hopes that an awareness of the issue in Jackson will bring about the changes necessary to build a more sustainable water system.

“We need to continue to lift up the need for infrastructure. At this point, what is the success and failure of our economy?” Lumumba said. “It needs to be less about the stock market and more about sustainable development goals, whether people have access to sustainable infrastructure. Those are the metrics we need to evaluate this nation.”

Since Wednesday, residents across the city have been left with little to no water pressure due to issues with the city's water distribution system. The entire city remains under a boil water notice.

In light of the crisis, the city plans to distribute bottled water and non-potable water to residents at fire stations and city facilities as early as Thursday afternoon, although a specific time was unavailable.

""I owe you honesty. I owe you truth,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said at a news conference Thursday at the city's Real Time Command Center. ""We do not have a definitive timeline on water restoration.""

Public Works Director Charles Williams said it is possible water will be restored by this weekend, but cautioned it is not a certainty given the cold snap.

""The weather system has created havoc on the water distribution system and also on our plants,"" Williams said. ""We knew cold temperatures were coming in but didn't factor the length of time it would be here.

""We're working through different scenarios and hopefully by this weekend it'll be restored. Unfortunately, It's difficult to give a time line.""

Transportation issues have delayed the delivery of chemicals to treat the water and the supply is getting low, officials added. Another factor tied to the shortage is that residents are staying at home during the cold snap and using more water than usual.

The mayor's office in a Wednesday night press release said it has been overwhelmed with calls from residents.

The office is asking for patience and to reserve calls to the following numbers for visible water leaks or urgent needs for assistance: 601-960-1777, 601-960-1781, 601-960-1778, 601-960-0379 or 601-960-1779.

Water distribution sites

Constituent Services Manager Keisha Sanders, who is heading up the bottled water distribution effort, said the city is finalizing delivery of the water with a vendor. Transportation to Jackson has been the biggest hitch holding the delivery up, she said.

When it is available, water will be distributed from the following locations:

Smith-Wills Stadium on Lakeland Drive

Metrocenter Mall

JPD Precinct One, 810 Cooper Rd.

Virgie P. Middleton Community Center, Flag Chapel Road

Jackson Police Officers Training Academy, 3000 St. Charles Road

Willowwood Community Center, 229 Lake Cove Dr.

City of Byram Fire Station

Non-potable water, which is unsafe to drink, will be distributed at fire stations across the city except for Station 20 on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Station 10 on Woodrow Wilson Avenue and Station 22 on Lakeshore Drive.

Entergy crews are currently cutting trees and working to restore the outages which occurred in pockets across the city, Lumumba said.

The mayor clarified there have been no rolling blackouts in Jackson as there have been in other cities, despite some claims on social media.

25,"Mar 9, 2021",PBS,"Water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi highlights ‘dire state’ of city’s infrastructure","Chokwe Antar Lumumba:

Well, I think something that it is not often talked about, but is a reality, is that there are equity questions in terms of how infrastructure is supported, in terms of how cities are supported.

And we need to be able to build equitable models of what it means to build and support cities. In fact, as we look at the success of our state economy, it should be more based on a dignity economy, which expresses the inherent dignity of every community, and not looked so based on issues of race.

It is not surprising. It has been the history of the city of Jackson to not have support which is commensurate with the support that the city of Jackson provides to the state of Mississippi. What I mean by that is that we're the largest city by a factor of three, meaning we provide the overwhelming contribution to the state's taxes.

We are the capital city, which means that many of our properties are not taxable. And we provide services to the state, such as give them water, with no payment for water bills. Where other cities, other capital cities in the nation get payment, in lieu of taxes, we don't receive that.

And so these are questions that have needed to be answered for a long time. So, most certainly, city leadership has a responsibility to make certain that we're in a better place than in which how we receive the city. The state has a responsibility as well.

And we will never solve a problem with the same level of thinking that created it. It is that kind of thinking that created the problem in the first place.","And we need to be able to build equitable models of what it means to build and support cities.

27,"Feb 25, 2021",Christian Science Monitor,Water problems across the South: Blame it on decades-old pipes,"The sunshine is back and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their citizens.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region's water mains, froze equipment, and left millions without service, it’s clear just how much work needs to be done.

Families stood for hours in lines to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

“You don’t realize how much you use water until you don’t have it,” said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the United States Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described “chronic, long-term and insufficient investment.” The report warned that the “nation’s public health and the economy will be at risk.""

Actually, it's already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, Tennessee, residents in the city of 650,000 have been told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they plan to use it for drinking, cooking, or brushing their teeth. More than 40,000 Louisianans still had water outages Wednesday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are “non-operational,” affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation's fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already-struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi’s majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson’s water problem a public health crisis.

“The wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,” the retired public works department employee said. “It’s not their concern because they don’t live here no more.”

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

“These pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,” he said. “They’ll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they’ll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.”

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets, and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, while collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

“The vulnerable are left behind,” she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to “old, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.”

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins’ bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants was being done, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city’s 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.

Jackson, Mississippi, has been experiencing water issues since winter storms in mid-February.

The city was under a boil notice as a result. Residents experienced low pressure in faucets and in the wake of the boil notice water distribution centers cropped up in the city.

Jackson went without clean water for nearly a month, according to Good Morning America.

According to Public Works Director Charles William, water main breaks that occurred complicated the process of getting water to residents, reported Good Morning America.

Gov. Tate Reeves suggested a state takeover of Jackson's water system and tweeted that he secured tankers to provide non potable water to residents. The Mississippi National Guard was activated as well to assist Jackson during the crisis.

According to a water sample taken Feb. 23, 2021, the water showed turbidity levels greater than 1.0 turbidity units, which is above the standard of 0.30 turbidity units, according to the city’s website.

According to Williams, the water system was still stabilizing and pressure was near ideal levels Feb. 28, but those levels had fallen. This was short-lived and the city once more began to experience low water pressure, with more than 10,000 water customers not having any water, reported USA Today.

Aging infrastructure was the main reason for failure, added Williams.

The Water System Business Administration announced it would offer Jackson residents a chance to have their bills adjusted if storm damage caused a lack of water or broken pipes, reported USA Today.

Additionally, The Department of Health and the EPA inspected the city’s two water treatment plants, O.B. Curtis and J.H. Fewell, on Feb. 3, 2020 and found numerous violations of federal regulations governing clean drinking water.

Federal officials will address the Jackson City Council at a May 11 meeting concerning Jackson’s water system, reported The Northside Sun.

Many Jackson residents and businesses remain with little to no water Monday as a water shortage for much of the city stretches to its sixth day.

Water customers in the city have been dealing with a water shortage since at least Wednesday, according to city officials. Some are seeing water trickle from their faucets while others have no water at all.

The crisis is becoming more dire as convenience and grocery stores across the city are also running out of bottled water following a surge in demand.

City officials are not giving a specific timeline for restoration of the water supply, except to say they are ""continuing to see progress.""

Due to demand, the city quickly ran out of water at seven distribution sites as soon as the sites opened Friday. City spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the city handed out over 26,500 bottles of water and nearly 7,000 gallons of non-potable water.

The city is now just delivering water to elderly and homebound residents.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba will hold a press conference at 1 p.m. Monday to address the water shortage.

The city says pressure is gradually increasing at its water treatment plants, but not enough to be at full functioning capacity.

Jackson water crisis: 'No definitive timeline' for restoring water in Jackson, mayor says

The mayor's office in a Sunday evening email said the city's goal is to reach an adequate level of water pressure at its water treatment plants, which will allow water to flow to its about 43,000 customers.

Meanwhile, customers calling about the shortage have overwhelmed the city's 311 hotline. They are asked to call the following numbers for assistance:

601-960-1111

601-960-1777

601-960-1781

601-960-1778

601-960-0379

601-960-1779

The city is also confronting another issue that could affect the city's water supply as the weather warms up from record lows last week. As the ground begins to shift, it's likely there will be a surge in the number of water line breaks, which could delay the restoration of water even further.

The city reported a total of 20 water line breaks over the weekend.

32,"Feb 23, 2021",WJTV,Jackson mayor responds to water outage criticism,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba held a news conference on Tuesday to give an update on the city’s response to low water pressure after last week’s winter storms.

The mayor said the water crisis was an “act of God” and not a failure of his administration or any individual. Lumumba also spoke out against what he called misinformation from Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes.

“We’ve done everything we could to secure tankers and was doing that before his rant. He talked about the tanker that was in South Jackson but failed to mention that it was the administration that is paying for that tanker. It is the administration that had the agreement with the tanker,” said Lumumba. “We’re leaving from council meetings distributing water to everybody across the city.”

Stokes is expected to address the mayor’s remarks during a news conference on Wednesday.

Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3. The tanker is located at 3200 Bailey Avenue, and it will be available from 11:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. on Tuesday, February 23.

Public Works Director Dr. Charles Williams said there were up to 28 water main breaks in the city. So far, 10 breaks have been repaired. He expects the water issues to be resolved by the end of the week.

Neighbors in South Jackson tend to get hit the hardest when the city has water issues. On TV Road, there is a booster station that used to be filled with water from 2014 to 2017. Now, it’s empty. Dr. Williams said it cannot be used until it reaches health standards.

“Not right now. We’re still in a compliance issue with the State Health Department, and until we can satisfy those compliance issues, we will not be able to use that booster station,” he stated.

There’s no timeframe on when the compliance issues at the booster station will be fixed.

Leaders said the volume of calls to 311 continues to overwhelm the system. They’re asking neighbors to reserve calls for visible water leaks and urgent needs for assistance. In addition to 311, neighbors can also call 601-960-1111 or 601-960-1778.

The Water Sewer Business Administration lobby will be temporarily closed starting February 23 until water is restored to the building. Customers will have multiple options to be able to pay bills.","Leaders announced a water tanker was made available in Ward 3.

The city announced additional distribution sites for water in an update on the city's water water shortage that has now stretched into an eighth day.

Officials say a majority of the city will see their water restored by the end of the week, but cautioned that could be delayed by water main breaks.

Jackson remains under a citywide boil-water notice.

Updated distribution sites

The city released an updated list of additional distribution sites for non-potable water on Wednesday.

It has purchased 45 pallets of bottled water and is continuing efforts to source more.

City officials said bottled water will be distributed at VA Field, located at 4400 Ofc. Thomas Catchings Drive, beginning at 3 p.m. Wednesday. The location will continue providing water to residents until supplies are exhausted.

Michelle Atoa, director of communications for Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, said more distribution sites could come in the near future and city leaders will notify residents when water is available.

In a tweet Tuesday, Gov. Tate Reeves said the state has acquired more tanker trucks of non-potable water to be delivered to the city. In addition, resources from the Mississippi National Guard have also been deployed in Jackson to assist residents.

Non-potable water from both the city of Jackson and the Mississippi National Guard will be available at the following locations from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. through Friday:

Forest Hill High School — 2607 Raymond Road

Raines Elementary School — 156 N. Flag Chapel Road

Garbage pickup

Waste Management has resumed regularly scheduled collection services, but is experiencing high volumes of garbage and trash along all routes, which may cause some delays in service. Any routes not completed on schedule will become first priority the next morning, the mayor's office said.

Waste Management said it anticipates all routes, including residential, commercial and roll-off, to be recovered by the end of the week.

The city is asking residents to only place household garbage out for both collection days this week in an effort to prevent heavy loads. It asks for residents to hold bulk items and yard debris for next week.

Waste Management will begin removing tree limbs and debris beginning next week.

Residents are asked to call the city's solid waste department at 601-960-1193 for more information.

Numbers to call

The city says it is still overwhelmed by calls to 311. It advises residents to reserve calls to the city hotline for water main breaks.

All water meter issues should be directed to 601-960-0762 and 601-960-0761.

34,"Feb 24, 2021",ABC News,"Tanker trucks, National Guard dispatched to Jackson, Mississippi, water crisis","The water is not expected to be completely restored until the end of the week.

The governor of Mississippi said he's dispatching the National Guard and more tanker trucks to the state's capital city to help bring an end to a water crisis that emerged following severe winter storms that crippled the community's aging infrastructure.

Many residents of Jackson, a city of more than 160,000 people, have been struggling for over a week to secure enough water to handle basic needs, officials said.

As he waited in line at a local high school to get water from a tanker truck, Alfred Anderson Jr. summed up the feelings that he said many Jackson taxpayers have: ""This is pitiful and a shame.""

""We pay all this money ... and we have got to come out here, most of these people, and wait on to try to get stuff to flush your toilets and, you know, do your hygiene stuff and whatever,"" Anderson told ABC affiliate station WAPT in Jackson.

Casandra Woody, another Jackson resident waiting in the same line for water, said the situation ""is sad.""

""I'm just fed up,"" Woody told WAPT as she watched residents fill up as many containers that could fit in their vehicles.

Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

""We secured tankers tonight to provide non-potable water for Jackson to jumpstart the system and accelerate the fix,"" Reeves said in a Tuesday night Twitter post. ""I have also activated the National Guard to complete the mission, and they will arrive early tomorrow (Wednesday). We will restore clean water for the people of Jackson!""

Reeves noted that Jackson is one of many Mississippi cities still recovering from electrical and water emergencies.

Charles Williams, the city's director of public works, told the Jackson City Council on Tuesday that water should be fully restored by the end of this week. But Williams said that as water pressure has been gradually increased a new problem has arisen -- busted water mains across the community. He said in recent days, city work crews have responded to fix at least 20 water main breaks.

""We had to buy some equipment in order to get where we are right now,"" Williams said. ""A lot of our equipment froze up because we could not get above 32 (degrees).""

The city's water treatment plant was knocked offline when back-to-back winter storms swept through the South last week bringing snow and below-freezing temperatures causing widespread power outages.

Williams said that at one point last week, pressure in the city's water system fell to 32 pounds per square inch. On Tuesday, he said the water pressure in the system was up to 67 PSI and that he hopes workers can get the pressure up to 80 to 85 PSI by the end of Wednesday.

Residents have been asked to boil their water before drinking and the city is establishing more locations where residents can go to get clean water.

Jackson Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba has been the target of criticism from his constituents and city council members for his handling of the water crisis and for not getting the state moving fast enough to help fix the situation.

But Lumumba said the crisis was an ""act of God"" that exposed the city's crumbling infrastructure that he said has been neglected for decades.

Reeves agreed, saying at a news conference on Tuesday that the challenges to Jackson's water system ""were born over literally 30, 40, 50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.""

""That 50 years of deferred maintenance is not something that we're going to fix in the next six to eight hours,"" Reeves said.","Tate Reeves said help is on the way to the struggling residents of Jackson, where Reeves happens to live.

35,"Mar 16, 2021",Mississippi Today,Hyde-Smith proposes federal funding to address Jackson water crisis,"In response to the ongoing water crisis in Jackson, U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced legislation Tuesday that would authorize federal funding for water infrastructure upgrades.

The Emergency Water Infrastructure Improvements Act taps three federal agencies to provide the city with a combination of loans, loan forgiveness and grants for water infrastructure projects. This federal response comes as state lawmakers weigh their options for addressing the crisis in the final weeks of the 2021 legislative session.

“Providing safe and reliable drinking water is a local responsibility, but there are federal programs and funds available that can be used to address these types of problems. I cannot sit back and watch Jackson schools, businesses and residents go without water,” Hyde-Smith said in a press release announcing the bill.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, and tens of thousands of residents — mostly Black — were without water for nearly three weeks. Today, city officials say “most” residents have had water service restored, though the entire city is still under a boil water notice.

Jxn's water woes became a crisis with the Feb. ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglect. I’ve introduced legislation to authorize a federal approach to help the @CityOfJxnMS work toward fixing the problem… — U.S. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (@SenHydeSmith) March 16, 2021

In her announcement, Hyde-Smith joined the chorus of elected officials misrepresenting the current crisis as solely a failure of local leadership.

“The weeks of hardship on Jackson residents is upsetting and completely unacceptable. Jackson’s water woes became a crisis with the February ice storm, but the hard truth is that the crisis was just waiting to happen after decades of neglecting necessary repairs and maintenance,” Hyde-Smith said. “It’s time to put that neglect behind us and work toward fixing the problem.”

Under Hyde-Smith’s bill, different levels and types of funding would come through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Economic Development Administration (EDA). Here’s what each of them would provide:

An additional $22 million in funding will be authorized for Jackson under the Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program.

The Corps would be able to use these additional funds to assist in the design and construction of environmental infrastructure projects.

An additional $150 million in funding will be added to the EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (DWSRF). With these funds, the EPA makes grants to States, which in turn issues loans to municipalities for drinking water improvements.

It is unclear how much of this funding would be directed to Mississippi, much less Jackson. The entire state of Mississippi received just $26,315,000 of the $2.7 billion in DWSRF funding made available in 2020.

Public water systems deemed eligible for this additional funding will be designated as “disadvantaged communities,” which qualifies them for loan subsidization and principal forgiveness. Eligible systems are also required to be located within states that had at least five major disasters in 2020 and suffered damages to water systems in recent winter storms.

The bill also stipulates that a maximum of 15% of these DWSRF funds can be used to purchase and install new water meters and modernize water billing systems. The city is currently running at a deficit of around $2 million each month in water collections revenue after a failed contract with the company Siemens left the city with more faulty water meters and billing issues than the city had before hiring them to overhaul these systems.

The bill directs the Secretary of Commerce to direct no less than $25 million in EDA Economic Adjustment Assistance(EAA) grant funds to “eligible systems.”

This funding would come from EAA grant funding from the CARES Act that has yet to be appropriated.

Other Mississippi lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to sign on to Hyde-Smith’s proposal. In her announcement, Hyde-Smith emphasized a need for bipartisan support to get the legislation passed.

“It is a responsible and worthwhile plan that will require the support of the Democrats in Congress and the administration to get it done, and I look forward to their cooperation,” Hyde-Smith said.

Eddie Staten pushed a grocery cart nearly a mile to the Mississippi College School of Law on Sunday for one reason — to find clean water.

Staten is one of the thousands of people in Jackson who were affected by the massive water outage after two winter storms swept through Mississippi in mid-February. Nearly three weeks later, pockets of the city still have no service.

He's one of the luckier ones — his water has returned. But Staten said his pressure is low and his toilet still doesn't flush. Andsometimes when he turns the faucet on, the water comes out brown.

""We don't drink (tap water) because we don't trust it,"" Staten said. ""Everybody said it's contaminated and not to drink it.""

Staten and others like him are the reason Jeffery Land, a Memphis, Tennessee, attorney, organized members of the Leo Bearman, Sr. American Inn of Courts — an organization of lawyers, judges and other legal professionals — to come together to bring more than 1,900 cases of bottled water to Jackson.

When the storms hit, Land said he was also under a boil water advisory, but his problems resolved after a few days. He said he's never heard of an outage lasting nearly as long as the one in Jackson and felt compelled to help.

""I saw the news story and figured I needed to do something,"" he said.

Land said after talking with others in the organization, he spoke with his father, Jeff Land, and began coordinating how to bring water to the Charles Clark American Inn of Courts in Jackson.

Jeff Land said the organization acquired the water in a matter of days and a local trucking company — Milan Supply Chain Solutions — offered to transport it.

""I sent a text to the CEO, Michael McLarty, ... and he called me three minutes later and said it's a done deal,"" he said.

Land was able to set up a distribution site in the parking lot of the Mississippi College School of Law on East Griffith Street because the college hosts the Jackson branch. Only 30 minutes after distribution started, organizers estimated 50 cars had already come through to get water.

Land isn't the only person to bring outside help to Jackson.The New Orleans Pelicans basketball team donated two truckloads of water on Monday, which were distributed by the city. The athletics department at the University of Mississippi, in partnership with the Mississippi Food Network, also hosted a water drive during its recent series of baseball games against Belmont to contribute to the cause.

District 4 Chancery Court Judge Crystal Wise Martin, who was at the site Sunday with her family to help with distribution, said it felt good to see people willing to come together to help Jackson when it needed it the most.

""I'm just so warm that people are coming out ... to help people,"" she said. ""That's what life is really all about.""

Dig Deeper: Jackson mayor pens letter to officials requesting millions in relief as water crisis unfolds

During a news conference Friday, Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said pressure at the plant was improving and only pockets in south Jackson were still without service. Testing of the city's well water system to see if the boil advisory can be lifted began Friday. The surface water system will be tested when pressure levels stay stable for at least 48 hours, officials said.

Jackson residents are among those in this country who have experienced firsthand the suffering caused when water infrastructure fails.

More than 100 water main breaks recently forced tens of thousands of Jackson residents to go without running water for weeks in February and March – the third collapse of our water infrastructure since 2010.

Last May, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River. Many in our community still rely on lead pipes that pose serious health hazards.

All of these problems require serious investments to fix. But solutions to the gaps in Jackson’s water system require more than stopgap measures; they need sustained and thoughtful investment from all levels of government, the private sector and our residents. The American Jobs Plan may just be what our city has been crying out for, and it’s time we communicate loud and clear about what we need to fix what is broken.

Until now, the city of Jackson and its residents have been forced to tackle the bulk of the estimated $2 billion water infrastructure spending gap we face alone. Even with a proposed one percent sales tax hike to raise revenue for the city’s water and sewer system, we won’t come close to raising the funding we need.

The $47 million that Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba called for in a letter to our state and federal representatives would throw us a critical lifeline — but it won’t be a substitute for the overhaul we actually need.

Let’s be clear. Many in our community are struggling to make ends meet, facing expensive water bills while also having to manage the impacts of failing infrastructure. These burdens are an especially pressing threat to the livelihoods of already vulnerable populations and people of color.

If we are serious about investing in infrastructure in Jackson, then we need to start by taking a long and hard look at how we equitably appropriate resources.

Jackson is also not unique. Communities across the country are facing their own structural challenges when it comes to water infrastructure: lead pipes, outdated equipment, lack of resources for backup generators, and a host of other issues keep us from being able to deliver clean and safe water to all of our residents.

Mississippi’s congressional delegation needs to stand up for the residents of Jackson. The Senate recently passed the Drinking Water and Wastewater Infrastructure Act with overwhelming bipartisan support, which gives all of us hope. We now need that spirit of bipartisanship and compromise to carry us through.

Our systems are failing us, and without immediate and holistic support from the federal government, they will continue to crumble around us and put lives at risk.

We can’t afford any delay in passing an infrastructure package that is going to deliver the resources necessary to tackle these issues from the ground up, repairing what we can and replacing what we must to make sure that the outages we saw in February never happen again.

Aaron Banks is the president of the Jackson City Council.

38,1 month ago,,"The Water Crisis In Jackson, Mississippi And The Remnants Of Housing Discrimination","Intense winter storms hit the southern region of the United States this winter. Areas of Texas were most severely hit, with millions left without power for over a month. Many of the southern states involved experienced unprecedented low temperatures and heavy snowfalls. The winter storms in Jackson, Mississippi, caused the water screens at the city’s water treatment plants to freeze, preventing water from passing through. According to WLBT News, the director of Jackson’s Public Works Department, Charles Williams, stated that once the city had gotten the water screens running again, there was an issue with the raw water pumps. The water pumps were responsible for pumping in natural water from Ross Barnett Reservoir and subsequently passing through the water screens to be filtered and placed in a settling tank.

The malfunctioning of equipment at the treatment plants caused water production in the city to slow significantly. Thousands of homes were affected by the water outage. Many citizens experienced low water pressure from faucets in their homes and unsafe water that was not properly filtered and disinfected. On February 16, the city issued a boil-water notice, meaning all Jackson residents were asked to boil their water before use. This notice continued for weeks, up until the city received clearance to lift it on March 17, over a month after the water outage. However, many in the community continue to experience water pressure issues.

Most recently, the Mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, wrote an email to Mississippi governor Tate Reeves requesting $47 million to fund repairs for the city’s water system. Jackson was only granted $3 million in funding, solely allocated to one water plant in the city. This is 3 million out of a total $356 million project budget.

Many Jackson residents have criticized the state’s response to the water crisis, including representative Chris Bell. According to Mississippi Today, Bell issues a statement in which he says, “Unfortunately, our requests have fallen on deaf ears with regard to our quality of water issues.”

African-Americans predominantly inhabit Jackson. According to a 2019 census, Black/African Americans make up approximately 82.2% of Jackson’s population. The city’s water system has been a longstanding issue that many believe was bound to escalate to a critical point.

Water issues can be traced back as early as 2016, when the city issued a warning on rising levels of lead in the water, resulting from negligent water treatment methods. A Detailed Facility Report on Jackson reveals that the city has had multiple Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) treatment technique violations over the course of 5 years, many of them unaddressed. Another Civil Enforcement Case Report reveals that on March 27, 2020, an emergency administrative order was issued in Jackson over traces of E.Coli found in the water. In addition, many winters in Jackson have lead to malfunctions in the water system in the past.

What’s most concerning is that the situation in Jackson is not an isolated one. Other predominantly black/African American communities in the U.S have experienced some form of negligence in regard to public health and city infrastructure. The people of Flint, Michigan (approximately 54.1% Black/African American according to 2019 census) went without safe drinking water for over four years after their water was contaminated with lead and legionella bacteria.

America’s history with racism is no secret, along with its history with discrimination. In the past, the practice of redlining allowed many banks in the U.S to deny mortgage loans to African Americans and other ethnic groups. Historically, mortgage lenders would draw a line on a map of the city in red ink that separated areas considered “high risk.” These areas were inhabited by predominantly African Americans and Latinos. On the other side would be the lower risk areas and more preferable to live in, mostly settled by whites.

The practice has since been outlawed. However, we can still see the after-effects of redlining to this day. When we see areas that are predominantly inhabited by minorities such as Jackson, Baltimore, Detroit and Flint, they are often areas that deal with major infrastructure issues and a lack of funding.

State leaders need to better address the clear economic and racial disparities within the country in a transparent way. These issues extend far beyond just race but also human rights. Everyone should have the right to clean and safe drinking water, and local government should not be able to ignore these issues with no repercussions. Ultimately, we must agree to tackle these disparities head-on and speak out against unethical practices.","The winter storms in Jackson, Mississippi, caused the water screens at the city’s water treatment plants to freeze, preventing water from passing through.

40,1 month ago,WJTV,Jackson leaders look for long term fix to prevent another water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Lawmakers slashed the amount of money the City of Jackson asked for to replace the city’s aging water system. But other routes for financial help are still open.

Jackson public works Director Dr. Charles Williams told me he has detailed plans on how to build back and replace the city water plants and its distribution system. He’s confident the funding will become available.

The city asked lawmakers for $47 million to address “immediate needs”. Lawmakers agreed to give $3 million for the project.

“If we were able to utilize $3 million then obviously that would assist us to upgrade the system at the treatment facilities,” Dr. Williams explained. “But also, an opportunity to maybe do an investment within the distribution system itself.”

Jackson state Representatives and Senators are optimistic $6 billion from the American Rescue Plan coming to Mississippi can be broken up to help fund permanent repairs. This on top of $47 million from Mississippi U.S Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith.

“We’re hoping that the United State’s Senator will come through and help the City of Jackson,” Councilman Kenneth Stokes of Ward three said Tuesday. “To help us in our water crisis. A sincere effort would be a new water plant.”

For Public Works Director Dr. Williams the priorities will be to get the plants weatherized and install larger distribution lines that will allow water to flow strongly into South Jackson.

“The plant itself needs equipment to properly operate,” Dr. Williams said. “It needs staffing so you need an annual budget that can provide funding in place to keep those mechanical and electrical systems operating.”

In its current status, Dr. Williams emphasized Jackson’s water treatment system is still vulnerable and could crash again if major repairs do not begin by next winter.

Going forward all eyes will be on how Mississippi legislators distribute the American Rescue Plan funds allocated to the state and when, and if, groundbreaking begins on these projects. The price tag for a complete fix of Jackson’s water system is estimated to be over $1 billion.

The city requested $47 million in state money. According to Mississippi Today, only $3 million dollars is being earmarked for Jackson. The funds would go to the city’s oldest water treatment plant.

Lawmakers expect federal dollars from the American Rescue Plan to provide funds for a longer-term water fix in Jackson.","(WJTV) – Lawmakers slashed the amount of money the City of Jackson asked for to replace the city’s aging water system.

41,1 month ago,Brookings Institution,"In Jackson, Miss., a water crisis has revealed the racial costs of legacy infrastructure","For nearly five weeks beginning in mid-February, parts of Jackson, Miss.—the state’s capital and most populous city—faced a water crisis. Two consecutive storms hit the city and led to prolonged freezing temperatures, causing pipes to burst. Thousands of residents were under a boil-water advisory, which was finally lifted on March 18.

Even before the storms hit, Jackson’s water system was a crisis in the making. “The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped,” said Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba on the structural challenges of paying for deferred infrastructure maintenance and legacy costs. “This is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson…we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state.”

Jackson’s crisis is tied to its inability to proactively invest in infrastructure upgrades. This inability stems from its ongoing economic and fiscal difficulties—a challenge that many other localities and water utilities face. In addition to a declining population, Jackson’s high percentage of low-income residents—in one of the poorest states in the country—limits steady and predictable revenues for public services, including drinking water and wastewater. Simply charging more for these services isn’t easy either, given widespread affordability issues. Mayor Lumumba has attempted to address these issues through new revenue sources—building off efforts of his predecessor and father Chokwe Lumumba, who died in office in 2014—but significant hurdles remain in addressing the estimated $2 billion backlog in needed water repairs.

This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs. Overlooking the impacts of uneven infrastructure on different types of households, especially by race and income, is a big part of that failure.

Jackson is a city with one of the largest shares of Black people in America, in the Blackest state in the union. Ideally, infrastructure serves as a shared foundation for economic, environmental, and public health between different neighborhoods and municipalities; however, infrastructure is often poorly maintained or intentionally overlooked in particular places, leading to a lack of access, affordability, and safety for many communities of color. Forward-looking infrastructure plans and projects designed to reduce risks, manage costs, and provide long-lasting benefits require different jurisdictions to work across economic and racial lines—something Mississippi has historically struggled to do. And since infrastructure is designed to be long-lived, these inequitable systems are also long-lived.

In the case of Jackson, legacy infrastructure goes hand-in-hand with a legacy of racism. The costs of legacy infrastructure parallel long-standing economic and racial disparities in the region. Without steady economic growth and shared economic opportunity—in jobs, wages, and other activity—municipalities and water utilities struggle to predictably and equitably generate enough revenue to cover their infrastructure needs. According to Brookings’s Metro Monitor, the Jackson metro area has only increased jobs by 6.6% and gross metropolitan product by 12.4% from 2009 to 2019—ranking 46th and 44th, respectively, out of the country’s 57 large metro areas with at least 500,000 residents. Over the same period, median wages in Jackson declined by 7.6%, the worst of all large metro areas. And while Jackson is closing the employment gap between people of color and white residents, it still ranks 55th out of 57 when it comes to closing the employment gap between the most advantaged and least advantaged neighborhoods.

Jackson’s water crisis was only the latest in a series of acute and chronic challenges. Past winters have seen broken water mains and business closures, while concerns over water quality, access, and affordability have persisted as well. Last year, half a billion gallons of raw sewage leaked into the Pearl River, in addition to 6 billion gallons of minimally treated sewage. And similar to cities such as Flint, Mich., lead pollution has been a concern. In 2016, Jackson warned citizens to take precautions about lead levels in water, but instead of replacing all pipes—a move that could cost billions of dollars that the city does not have—it moved forward with a lower-cost corrosion control contract. In turn, homeowners are continuing to bear responsibility for lead pipes and other health risks even while some are unable to pay for existing bills; in 2019, the city announced it would turn off water for 20,000 residents in an attempt to collect $45 million in back bills.

As the graphic below shows, water-related expenditures in Jackson have become increasingly untethered to revenues. Because the city has not made long-term and continued investments in its infrastructure, sporadic crises have led to increasingly expensive repairs.

Rising costs and declining revenues—combined with a lack of proactive infrastructure planning and investment in particular neighborhoods of need—have put Jackson in a difficult position. Present and past infrastructure decisions—not only around drinking water and wastewater, but also roadways, mass transit, electricity, and broadband—can lock in structural inequities. Black-majority places such as Jackson, Baltimore, Detroit, and Flint are burdened by both a legacy of infrastructure and racism, setting the stage for future tragedies.

But just as infrastructure can lead to long-lasting costs, it can also be a foundation for long-lasting benefits. Better defining and addressing Jackson’s legacy infrastructure challenges can chart a new path. That requires public and private leaders at the state, regional, and city level—including water utilities—to talk about future and existing infrastructure needs in terms of the most vulnerable households, engage with a greater variety of residents, and test new projects and ideas. For instance, more coordinated “One Water” planning efforts can bridge policy and investment gaps among municipal leaders while involving community-based organizations, workforce development bodies, and other groups that have long been ignored. Better measuring water affordability needs and launching more robust customer assistance programs can make a difference too. And seeking more resilient solutions, including green infrastructure upgrades, can lead to lasting economic and environmental returns.

It looks like President Joe Biden’s next policy priority will be infrastructure. The administration would be wise to acknowledge that simply spending more money is not necessarily the solution. Instead, they should ensure that money is spent to maintain and rebuild the legacy infrastructure that has historically failed Black communities like those in Jackson.","This enormous price tag—and the human suffering that accompanies it—represents a failure of state and regional leaders to measure, plan, and coordinate action around infrastructure needs.

Thousands get back water after going without for a week or so as boil-water advisories start to evaporate across the South

Water supply has been returned to many who lost it during last week's snow and ice storms across the South, officials reported.

And boil-water advisories are starting to evaporate across southwestern Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi, the officials said.

But a water-fueled political spat in capitol city Jackson, Mississippi, grew in intensity as the mayor and a council member traded accusations in dueling press conferences.

Here's a look across the region:

Memphis:

Water pressure readings in this southwestern Tennessee city improved throughout the day Wednesday, sparking optimism that a citywide boil-water advisory would be lifted soon.

""This is probably the most optimistic I've been all week,"" Memphis Light, Gas and Water CEO J.T. Young said Wednesday afternoon at a press conference.

The utility issued a boil water advisory last Thursday after extreme cold temperatures gripped much of the Mid-South.

The combination of customers leaving their faucets running to prevent them from freezing, dozens of broken water mains, and frozen reservoirs led to low water pressure across the city.

Mississippi:

Thousands of Jackson residents continued to have little or no water pressure Wednesday, but officials said they hoped to have full service restored by Friday.

Meanwhile, the water shortage sparked a growing political spat between the mayor and a council member.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba unloaded a slew of grievances against Ward 3 Councilman Kenneth Stokes at a press conference Tuesday. The mayor accused Stokes of spreading misinformation — about the water shortage and other issues — for years.

Stokes was expected to respond with his own press conference Wednesday afternoon.

Asked whether it was right to go after a councilman during a water crisis, the mayor said Tuesday he had remained silent for too long and was ""speaking out of passion.""

Jackson, Mississippi, is finally on its way out of a nightmare water crisis.

Freezing winter storms wreaked havoc on Jackson’s old and crumbling water infrastructure. In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water. But while the Texas blackouts dominated the news cycle, Jackson’s water crises received far less attention, even as it extended into its fourth week. Jackson’s residents, 80 percent of whom are Black and nearly 30 percent of whom live below the poverty line, have been forced to boil water to drink, bathe, and use the bathroom. They’ve collected rainwater to flush their toilets and bought bottled water to brush their teeth. In the middle of a pandemic, residents of Jackson haven’t had reliable access to clean water to wash their hands.

This water crisis was years in the making. For the past 50 years the Republican-led state government has been cutting taxes and neglecting to invest in infrastructure repairs. Jackson’s shrinking tax base has been exacerbated by white flight and the fact that, unlike other capital cities, Jackson doesn’t make money off property taxes for state-owned buildings. The city of Jackson has a $300 million budget. According to Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, Jackson’s wastewater and drinking water systems require at least $2 billion of repairs.

“It isn’t a matter of if these systems will fail, it’s a matter of when these systems will fail,” Lumumba tells Nathalie Baptiste on the Mother Jones Podcast. “Pipes were bursting throughout the system because they are over 100 years. They’re like peanut brittle.”

On March 17, the city of Jackson Mississippi finally lifted its boil water notice. But Jackson’s water crisis laid bare the budget, infrastructure, and equity issues that leave cities like Jackson vulnerable to future extreme weather events.

“Climate change is significantly impacting the pressure on our infrastructure. We have hotter summers, colder winters, and more rain in the rainy season,” say’s Mayor Lumumba. “They’re becoming our new normal.”","In mid-February the city experienced over 80 water main breaks, leaving tens of thousands of residents without running water.

A combination of bad weather and failed infrastructure meant thousands of people in the mostly Black city of Jackson spent weeks without the essential resource in February and early March. Residents had to rely on donated water for everyday tasks. While it seems like Jackson’s immediate water crisis is getting resolved, many Black communities in the rural South and elsewhere struggle to get access to clean water every day. It’s a complicated problem that doesn’t get the same national attention as other racial justice priorities.

On Friday’s episode of A Word, I spoke with Catherine Coleman Flowers, who is working to change that. She’s the author of Waste: One Woman’s Fight Against America’s Dirty Secret and a winner of a 2020 MacArthur “Genius Grant.” Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Jason Johnson: What are some of the issues with infrastructure, communication, and government that led to this happening in Jackson, Mississippi, which is actually a state capital?

Catherine Coleman Flowers: What’s happening in Jackson is not unusual. I believe that what we will find in a lot of these areas, especially in the South, is the type of benign neglect of these cities. Benign neglect means there’s an intentional avoidance of putting the type of dollars in infrastructure—in these Southern communities, it’s not coming from the tax base because the tax base is not there. A lot of it comes from the federal government, but it’s those cities that have lobbyists or political connections that get the money over and over again. We have to change that paradigm.

Advertisement

One of the things that I’ve read about Jackson was the mayor was quoted and he talks about how brittle the pipes were. The infrastructure that was probably put in Jackson was put in there when Jackson was white predominantly. It probably has not been replaced, and the local community cannot afford to replace it. But we have to do something about this because Jackson’s not the only one. It’s like with Flint and the lead problem. Flint was just the canary in the coal mine. There’s lead issues throughout the United States that have not been addressed. And likewise, there are infrastructure water issues throughout the United States. When you look at Jackson, Jackson was also the convergence of poor infrastructure and climate change. We’re going to see more climate events, but these extreme weather patterns are going to expose, like COVID did, all of these disparities as it relates to infrastructure issues.

Have you seen climate change make clean water access even harder for rural Black communities?

Yes, in California, Allensworth in the Central Valley, because of the water being used by the farming industry there. There’s a Black community that historically was the first Black community in California funded by Black folk, and now, they can’t drink the water because the water is full of arsenic that’s naturally forming. The parts of the arsenic is greater than the parts of the water, so therefore, they can’t drink it.

So when it comes to this kind of activism, we always hear about famous white women. They get movies. We have Silkwood. We’ve got Erin Brockovich. But we don’t hear often about the Black women who are on the ground doing this kind of work. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself, what you saw in Lowndes County, Alabama, and how your activism began on environmental justice issues?

Advertisement

Well, my activism began on environmental justice issues because I came from activist parents. When I moved back to Lowndes County in 2000, I ran into the fact that there were Black people that were being arrested because they could not afford an on-site septic system. A lot of the people that are in rural communities are not in incorporated areas. All the laws are written to support municipalities, but in a rural community, generally, there’s no wastewater treatment, no decentralized system. I live in Montgomery, Alabama, and we have a decentralized system, and all I had to do when I bought a house was just move into the house and pay to have my water turned on. Or if I was building a house in Montgomery, it would just connect to the decentralized system.

“When infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities.” — Catherine Coleman Flowers

However, in rural communities like Lowndes County, the homeowner is responsible for their own decentralized system. These systems in Lowndes County are very, very expensive, especially if you’re a poor family. To give you an example, last year we were trying to work with a family prior to COVID to get a septic system for them. They built down 25 inches, in this case, and struck water. The system that she would have needed would have cost $28,000. You don’t go to the bank and borrow that. Even if it’s $6,000 for a septic system, there’s no financing for it. A mobile home can come with the plumbing, the indoor plumbing, the toilets. You can connect it to a straight pipe or PVC pipe and have it protruding from the home. When they flush the toilet, it goes out on top of the ground. That’s one of the things, and they have criminalized that here in the state of Alabama and in a lot of states. Then the second problem is people that have septic systems that have failed. When they fail, they can also be criminalized for that. I got involved back in 2002. I had gone to visit a husband and wife who had been arrested because they had a failing septic system. And then later, we found out that there were lots of people in the county that either had already been arrested or were facing arrest because they did not have a working septic system. So I got involved by stopping the criminalization, at least in Lowndes County, of poor people who could not afford on-site sanitation.

It would seem to me also that this is a structural issue. Because as Black folk were segregated or kept out of certain neighborhoods in certain places in the South, they weren’t able to live in places that were incorporated that had plumbing systems. So you’re not only being punished through white supremacy and segregation forcing you out, but you’re then being fined and criminalized again when you have to provide resources for yourself that other people are getting through tax money.

Yes, Montgomery at one point was one of the top slave trading places in this country. That is why the lynching memorial, the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, is located in Montgomery. When you walk from the river in Montgomery and walk down Commerce Street, those buildings, a lot of them, were slaveholding pens. People were auctioned off at Court Square, which is not far from the Rosa Parks Museum.

Those of us that are part of that heritage, our families ended up in places like Lowndes County. When I go back and look at the census records, I see that our families have been there since the early 1800s, in some cases. So these rural communities, there’s a legacy and traditions where there are churches and schools and graveyards where people have been there forever. But when infrastructure came in, I think there was neglect of these communities, and the communities that were left out were those communities of color. That is a major problem that we see in the South around infrastructure and environmental justice.

Catherine, you’ve worked with Democrats and Republicans. I mean, on all sides. You’ve worked with Bernie Sanders. You worked with [former Alabama Senator] Jeff Sessions, who’s the last person on the planet who I would ever think would care anything about the struggles of rural Black people. I got to ask you, when you’re dealing with these powerful political leaders in and out of office, when they come to you and say, “What can I do to help?,” what’s the first thing that you tell them?

With Jeff Sessions, the way it happened, I just happened to be at a town hall meeting. I was the economic development coordinator for the county. He was a U.S. senator, and he talked about the type of grants that were available. And then I asked the question, “You mentioned these grants, but how do poor communities get access to them if they have to pay a match?” He came to me afterward and said, “I’ve always wanted to know the answer to that. I’m from Wilcox County, Alabama. I grew up poor. We didn’t have a television in our house until I was 10 years of age.” That’s how we started our conversation. We had to be human first. And from that point, he was very helpful. Hyundai had decided it was going to locate in Alabama, in Montgomery. At that time, when they decided to locate there, the state officials weren’t taking them to Lowndes County at all. When they had the groundbreaking ceremony, everybody was from Eastern Alabama, and there was nobody with a shovel that was Black. All the Black people kind of huddled together and everybody was saying, “Lowndes County’s right over there. Why is there nobody here from Lowndes County with a shovel?” Ultimately, I was able to help recruit tier 1 suppliers to Hyundai to Lowndes County. But we needed the infrastructure. We didn’t have industrial development parks or anything like that. Sen. Sessions was very helpful in that.

In terms of Bernie Sanders, he actually came to visit Lowndes County. He went to the home of Pamela Rush, who I write about in my book. I felt that you cannot understand inequality unless you see it for yourself. So to come into her home and see how she was living in a dilapidated mobile home that she still owed money on, that did not appreciate in value—living with two children, one child sleeping on a CPAP machine—Bernie Sanders said to me, “Catherine, now I understand when you talk about the intersection of climate change and environmental justice and racial justice.” Because I told his people, “I have to plan this trip because I want to make sure it’s not going to be a photo-op. He’s going to actually go and see people and see the situation so that he can know what kind of policies we need to have in place to address this.” I didn’t have an ask other than for him to come and see. And then once he saw and he was looking at what resources or what ways he could potentially help, and it has led to a shift in government policy that I could not have even imagined when I made that request for him to come and see.

45,1 month ago,Jackson Free Press,Jackson Free Press,"David Martin, a 29-year-old engineer at Hunter Engineering Company's Raymond office, says that a boosted Jackson economy is on his wish list for Jackson's next mayor. The Jacksonian packed his red car at Raceway gas station on Highway 18 to fill up on gas on March 20 and spoke with the reporter there to interview Jackson residents on what they want from the winning mayoral candidate in the coming election.

Seven people are running against Mayor Chokwe A. Lumumba to wrest the city's leadership from his grasp after his first term ends in early July. Two Democrats are running against him: fireman Kenneth Wilson and west Jackson native Patty Patterson; two Republicans: Jason Wells and Ponto Downing; and three independent candidates: Shafeqah Lodree, Charlotte Reeves and Les Tannehill.

The April 6 primary election only includes candidates running as Democrats or Republicans. The three independent candidates will join the two parties' primary election winners as contestants in the June 8 municipal general election.

Martin said he believes that the city is full of potential awaiting exploration. Rather than see degradation, he sees possibilities and wants an emphasis on management, refusing to buy into the narrative that Jackson has a shortage of resources.

""I want more concern with how money is being spent in Jackson,"" Martin said. ""Jackson is not—I guess you could say—a poor city; we have a lot of resources that are mismanaged basically."" He did not provide any data to back this claim.

""You have a lot of (calls for) help that goes unanswered like they don't—I guess—try, they don't try all the things that they could be trying to make this city better than what it could be,"" Martin added. ""You got a lot of rundown areas of town that could be used, we can boost the economy, we've got the space, and we've got the people, so we've got the workforce, but there are no jobs for the workforce we have.""

Martin says more opportunities for young people will go a long way. ""But if there aren't nobody hiring, what else (are) they going to do?"" he asked. ""I just want to see (a) better direction for the city.""

Carrie Jones, also at the gas station, expressed concern about the city's water situation, still reeling from the February winter storm that resulted in water outages and a month-long citywide boil-water notice. She wants repairs to be a priority, including low water pressure. Even after the city lifted the boil-water notice one month after the water crisis started, ""people are still afraid to drink the water,"" Jones said. ""People (are) still kind of leery of it.""

City of Jackson Election Commission Chairwoman Linda Sanders said her team is preparing for the 138,000 people on the voter roll, but projected based on past numbers that far fewer will turn up to vote.

""We have ordered equipment, and we also ordered ballots for everybody, and we're prepared and ready for them,"" she told the Jackson Free Press on March 18. ""We don't even get 50,000 voters for the municipal, but of course we prepare for them, and we are ready for them.""

The capital city's population is currently about 160,000 people, down from a historic high of 200,000.

Chokwe A. Lumumba, Incumbent Democrat

In statements provided to the Jackson Free Press, Lumumba referenced his popularity in the 2017 municipal election that ushered in his first term, saying he won the large Democratic primary field convincingly without a runoff and claimed numerous achievements. On why he is seeking reelection, he touts his experience of the last four years.

""Jackson needs a mayor who has been tested, who has shown up for our city, who understands the process and, in spite of the challenges, knows how to collaborate and get things done,"" he said in the statement.

Lumumba's reelection website contains a video of him addressing the increased rate of homicide—128 in 2020—in the city under his watch and what he plans to do about it.

""Most important aspect of this job is the work that we do to protect the lives of our residents,"" he said. ""The violence we have experienced in our city has revealed the deep crisis in which too many of our families find themselves and the need to challenge ourselves to meet these new realities with much more.""

Lumumba mentioned more officers' recruitment and adjustment of entry-level salaries for JPD, provision of body cameras and improved street lighting as parts of his efforts. He said that the pandemic had aggravated societal problems. He also noted that state and federal governments should do more for mental health and other supports.

""Our vision of Jackson will be a city that seeks to solve problems of crime holistically as symptoms of much deeper issues,"" Lumumba said in the video presentation. ""A city with commitment and compassion for all of our residents, a holistic approach to addressing the root causes of crime is important because it works.""

Patty Patterson, Democrat

Patterson provided information to the Jackson Free Press revealing her work as an entrepreneur and on community-engagement initiatives. She said she is running for mayor to get Jackson back on the right track.

""With the understanding of municipal government, I can start on Day One with a plan of action to improve our essential qualities,"" she stated. ""Improving our water quality, crime-fighting abilities, infrastructure, and public education system will allow our city to build strong economic base.""

The first thing on her vision on her campaign website is ""Crime and Public Safety,"" a common concern.

""Jackson's Police and Fire Departments must be equipped with modern technology and adequate resources in order to serve and protect the citizens of Jackson,"" she stated. ""It is equally important that our first responders safely return homes to their families.""

""Programs will be initiated to create a stable workforce and reduce crime,"" she added. ""We can also get a stronger grip on crime when we remove guns from the hands of irresponsible citizens.""

She mentioned mental health as linked to crime and said she will take a stronger approach toward addressing it and also join forces with other law enforcement agencies.

Kenneth Wilson, Democrat

Kenneth Wilson, Ridgewood Park Neighborhood Association president and former City of Jackson firefighter, is campaigning on five issues, as noted on his campaign website: public safety, infrastructure, community improvement, education and economic improvement.

In a YouTube video, Wilson mentioned the impact of high homicide rates on families and said that businesses are leaving because of crime. ""Good businesses that have been burglarized multiple times, and absolutely nothing has been done about it,"" he said.

Wilson mentioned that his solution to the safety concern starts with appointing another police chief, replacing James Davis. However, Lumumba has stated that Davis has his confidence.

""The first thing we have to do, we have to appoint a (police) chief that the men and women will support. I think that's very essential if we intend to improve the city of Jackson,"" Wilson said. His solution also includes providing youth-based programs. His background information he sent to Jackson Free Press detailed his involvement in the life of young people in the city.

He said he is running for mayor to put in place creative leadership.

""Crime has spread across our city so much that our elders will not commute after dark,"" he stated. ""My crime plan requires implementing community policing, which makes Jackson Police Department a proactive Police Department versus what we currently have is a reactive Police Department.""

Jason Wells, Republican

Thirty-eight-year-old Republican Jason Wells, a Lexington, Miss., police officer who stays in Jackson, said in a statement to the Jackson Free Press that crime is first among his priorities if he becomes mayor. He promises a focus on law enforcement and to give pay raises to those not included in the Lumumba administration's pay raise. ""Combating crime is multi-faceted,"" he stated. ""Law enforcement officers along with community members have a considerable part to play."" He decries the number of police officers in the city compared to the population.

""Community members can't go silent or intentionally mislead police when questioned about crimes and those who commit them, family or not,"" he added. ""Gotta change the culture, JPD and community members. Zero tolerance ... from littering to capital murder. True accountability-Zero Tolerance culture.""

Ponto Downing, Republican

Seventy-six-year-old Ponto Downing joins Wells on the ballot on April 6 for the city-wide Republican primary election. He described himself as walking history in a written statement to the Jackson Free Press. Downing told this reporter that he distances himself from the internet but will have to use it if he becomes mayor. ""I'm running for mayor out of desperation,"" he stated. ""Someone has to do something--soon!""

""If elected all of Jackson's problems will be solved quickly!"" he added. ""But I know my odds of being Mayor are 100-1! But hopefully, Gov. Tate Reeves will intervene (and) rescue the capitol.""

At a mayoral debate presented by Women for Progress, Downing said he does not actually want to be mayor, but feels like he has to run. He also claimed without evidence that there is a ""war on white people"" in Jackson. (He is white.)

All Voters Can Vote in Primary

Jackson Election Commission Chairwoman Sanders told the Jackson Free Press that the two parties have contracted with the municipal election body to conduct the April 6 primary election after absentee voting ends on April 3. Any registered voter in the city can participate at any of the 82 precincts in the primary election without identifying as a registered Republican or Democrat, Sanders said.

""In Mississippi, a primary candidate must win a majority of the votes cast for the office he or she is seeking in order to secure the nomination,"" Ballotpedia, dubbed the digital encyclopedia of American politics and elections, stated. ""If no candidate for an office wins a majority of votes cast in the primary, a runoff election between the top two vote-getters is held.""

Any possible runoff in the election will be between the two candidates with the highest votes on a ballot. The three-way Democratic party primary may lead to a runoff if none of the candidates wins more than 50% of the cast votes. Based on this requirement, the Republican primary, which is between two people, will not go into a runoff; one of the two will get more than half.

""If you are a registered voter, and you are a registered voter within 30 days before the date of the election, you can vote, either Republican or Democrat,"" Sanders said. ""You can vote (but) you can't vote for both of them.""

Each precinct will have a Democratic Party area and a Republican Party area, and the voters will choose one of the two to vote under but not both. Election Commissioner Sanders said each precinct on primary election day will have separate tables for the two parties. ""The Democrats will have their own table, and the Republicans on the other side will have (their) own table. And you go to the one that you choose to vote in,"" Sanders said.

There is the option of write-ins to vote for someone else other than the candidates listed for the mayor and ward positions. The Republican party's primary ballot has only the mayoral position listed. It is the only position with more than one Republican candidate.

The three independent mayoral candidates will join the Democratic and Republican primary elections winners on the ballot on June 8 for the general election.

Les Tannehill, Independent

Independent candidate Tannehill, former Jackson Police Department and former Hinds County Sheriff's Department officer and business owner, said on his campaign website that rebuilding the city to ""be a safe and prosperous city is going to take partnerships.""

""I have developed many contacts and formed many relationships on the federal, state and local levels,"" he stated. ""All of which would be glad to participate in making the City of Jackson a better place for all of us and our families to live, work, play and worship.""

In a statement on his plan for the city, Tannehill said that he is running for mayor because he feels the pain of the capital city. ""In the streets of Jackson, MS I have felt the pain of dying young men, who had been shot, as I knelt beside them trying to stop the bleeding until paramedics arrived,"" he said.

""As a law enforcement officer, I felt the pain of being underpaid, under-appreciated, under-staffed and overworked,"" he added. ""I've felt the pain of the Jackson Fire Department, who worked hand-in-hand with us, face the same difficulties working tirelessly, responding to call after call.""

Shafeqah ""BigMama"" Lodree, Independent

Lodree, who runs a bail bonding business, wants to fight crime, according to a statement she provided to the Jackson Free Press on her background.

""Once elected, one of her primary focuses will be reducing crime,"" the statement said. ""Having worked in the bail industry for over a decade, she's had a bird's eye view of the plethora of flaws in the system.""

""She acknowledges the need for what she calls 'Jail Reform' and has a plan to Bail Jackson out! Appointing a competent and engaged Chief that understands the importance of maintaining a great morale in the department can drastically reduce crime in Jackson.""

She stated that she wants to reach out to registered voters who have not been turning up at the polls. ""The population of Jackson is over 150,000, and I haven't seen 50,000 people vote in municipal elections in years,"" she said. ""That lets me know that at least another 50,000 people have given up.""

Charlotte Reeves, Independent

Businesswoman Charlotte Reeves also addressed insecurity in her statement of purpose she sent to the Jackson Free Press.

""Under the Reeves leadership, the depressed, doomed and gloomy crime infested city will be revitalized,"" the past mayoral candidate stated. ""As Mayor, citizens will not have to wait another year, another term, or another 3 decades to see a positive improvement in Jackson.""

She indicated that her political relationships will help the city. ""Over her lifetime, she has watched the city fall apart. Reeves refused to give up on Jackson—a city she loves,"" the document says.

More than a Job

Forty-seven-year-old Roymon Gathrite told the Jackson Free Press at the Raceway gas station that he desires that the mayor of Jackson, after the June 8 election, will display the highest commitment.

""I expect for the next mayor of Jackson to have some concern for the city and the citizens of Jackson, not just have a position or a job,"" Gathrite told the Jackson Free Press. ""(I expect the person) to bring the city back to life, not just talk about it, but to be about it.""

""I would like to see businesses coming back to Jackson. You got less jobs in Jackson, and they're just not putting forth the effort to just get things done and put them in the right perspective,"" he added.

Painter Jake Walters, 40, said he wants a focus on the infrastructure and tighter budgeting from the mayor, while reflecting on the winter storm that exposed the city's aging water infrastructure.

""We need some help as far as the water supply goes, and some of the outlying cities around Jackson have newer infrastructure than Jackson by at least 75 years,"" Walters said. ""So we need more of our budget (going towards) fixing the pipes and making sure that we have generally quicker response time as it relates to when the power goes out or when the water goes out.""

""I'd like for the people's voice to be considered before actions are taken just on a basic level,"" he added.

46,1 week ago,The Clarion-Ledger,"EPA to Jackson, Mississippi: Water safe to drink despite numerous problems with system","CLOSE James and Jean Brooks won't even drink Jackson city water. As residents for decades, the recent city water crisis was nothing new. Mississippi Clarion Ledger

Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday spelled out significant concerns with the city's water system, including necessary fixes to maintain safe drinking water, following the worst water crisis Jackson has seen in recent history.

EPA administrators in their first public appearance with city officials said it will take both short-term and long-term fixes to remedy the system, a prospect that will require millions of dollars of funding.

The visit follows an inspection by the federal agency, along with the state Department of Health, in February of last year that found several severe violations at the city's two water treatment plants, the O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Facility and the J.H. Fewell Water Treatment Facility.

(Photo: Barbara Gauntt/Clarion Ledger)

The health department, which oversees water quality across the state, later referred the inspection findings back to the EPA to take the lead on enforcement, and the EPA sent the city a list of required fixes, although no time table was cited.

The deficiencies at the plant, which ranged from a shortage of operators to malfunctioning equipment, raised immediate concerns about the reliability of the system to provide safe drinking water, said Carol Kemker, the director of the Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Division of the agency.

City unveils water billing plan: Plan to overhaul Jackson's water billing system two months away, consultant says

The concerns prompted an emergency order under the Safe Drinking Water Act, she warned the council, which is meant to stem ""an impending dangerous condition from materializing or reduce or eliminate a dangerous situation.""

The city will be under the order until the EPA determines all violations have been rectified. Neither Kemker nor city officials said when they expect that to happen. The city will likely have to address the order in both the short-term and long-term, meaning it could be years before Jackson gets a clean bill of health from the agency, she said.

""It will take several years to complete work necessary to repair and rehabilitate the drinking water system here,"" she said.

While most of the violations cited the city's treatment plants, Kemker said the EPA was concerned with the city's water quality, in particular the level of turbidity, or cloudiness, and sediment in the water system that can contain or conceal bacteria and viruses.

But when asked, she said the water in Jackson is safe to drink.

""The water is safe to drink in the immediate time frame. We'd like to try and minimize the boil water notices,"" she said.

Kemker said the city has notified the EPA of its progress on fixing the system, as required by federal law, and the two parties meet twice weekly to determine the steps to fix the city's system.

The city's sewage system is under a close to billion dollar consent decree from the EPA for violations of the Clean Water Act.

The mayor's administration requested $47 million worth of funding from the state to address the specific deficiencies listed by the EPA in the midst of the water crisis. It has also applied for federal grants. The city was recently awarded over $43 million in coronavirus-related funds from the federal government as part of the American Rescue Plan. The funds can be used toward water infrastructure, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.

The inspection and subsequent warning preceded the water crisis leading to questions of whether it could have been prevented.

Public Works Director Charles Williams maintains the system was bound to crash given the scale of the issues and the lack of funding to address them.

Freezing temperatures crippled the city's water treatment plants leading to the worst water crisis in recent history. While other cities suffered similar problems with their water systems, some Jackson residents remained without water for weeks, and a citywide boil water notice extended for nearly a month.

48,"Mar 24, 2021",Mississippi Today,Legislative leaders kill key proposal to address Jackson water crisis,"A bill to allow Jackson to raise its citywide sales tax by 1 cent for water and sewer system repairs is dead in the final days of the 2021 legislative session.

A historic winter storm in mid-February froze water plant equipment and burst many pipes in the capital city, leaving at least 40,000 residents — mostly Black — without water for nearly three weeks. City leaders, who have neglected funding the system for decades, say they need major investment from the state and federal government to repair the system, which is estimated to cost at least $1 billion.

The Jackson City Council attempted to take matters into its own hands, passing a proposal in early March to raise the city’s sales tax by 1 cent. That new revenue — an estimated $14 million per year — would be used to back large bonds for repairing and replacing the city’s water and sewer system. But state law requires approval from lawmakers before the local sales tax increase could be placed on a citywide ballot. State Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, filed a bill on behalf of the city to acquire legislative sign-off on the 1-cent proposal.

That bill will die without committee consideration, House Local and Private Chairman Manly Barton, R-Moss Point, told Mississippi Today — a blow to the capital city’s main legislative ask as it struggles to afford water system repairs.

Barton said killing the bill is based on precedent — with the 2013 exception of allowing a previous 1-cent sales tax increase for Jackson — of not allowing cities to add on to the state’s sales tax.

“We have been very hesitant to do general sales tax increases for other cities. In fact, we turn them down every year,” Barton said. “We had four or five requests this year. A lot of times the bills don’t even get filed. We work with them on local food-and-beverage, hotel-motel taxes, but there’s just no appetite to do general sales taxes. We’ve been pretty consistent … Of course there was the one for Jackson some years ago — there were conditions set on that and a committee — but we have otherwise been pretty consistent.”

Barton continued: “I think the 1-cent tax would generate about $14 million for Jackson, but it’s a really big hole they’re trying to fill with infrastructure. What I did say is I would do everything I could to help find revenue somewhere else if we possibly can.”

City leaders all along have said the intended purpose of that $14 million a year in new revenue would be to back large bonds, possibly giving the city hundreds of millions they could use in the short-term for infrastructure upgrades.

“This bill, which includes a one percent tax, will support repairing infrastructure after decades of neglect,” Bell told Mississippi Today. “We’ll still need additional support, but this is a first step at a time of urgent need. Sadly, our plan hasn’t been accepted by those in leadership, which further makes our road to recovery difficult.”

READ MORE: “A profound betrayal of trust”: Why Jackson’s water system is broken

Earlier this month in private meetings with both House Speaker Philip Gunn and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba asked for support of Bell’s bill. The 1-cent sales tax increase was the mayor’s main ask of the Republican leaders, along with state bonds that could help the city make emergency repairs on its water distribution system.

Local and private legislation like Bell’s bill traditionally requires support from all or most lawmakers of the locality in question — an unwritten but decades long-standing rule inside the Capitol. In this case, not all of Jackson’s House and Senate delegates were on board with the measure.

After his meeting with Lumumba, Gunn publicly expressed concern about allowing Jackson to raise its sales tax, prompting questions about whether Bell’s bill ever stood a chance of passing out of the House chamber.

“It creates a precedent, if you will, that may be a dangerous area to go to as far as other cities around the state wanting to do the same thing,” Gunn told Scott Simmons at WAPT earlier this month. “And we may get in a situation where the tax burden (on Jackson residents) is just too great.”

Even had the bill passed the House, it faced a difficult road in the Senate. Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, met privately on March 12 with four of the five state senators representing the city of Jackson. None of those senators — Democratic Sens. Sollie Norwood, Hillman Frazier, John Horhn and David Blount — told the lieutenant governor they supported the sales tax increase, according to several of the meeting’s attendees. Sen. Walter Michel, R-Ridgeland, could not attend the meeting but is said to oppose the sales tax increase.

“I am not in favor of (the 1-cent increase),” Horhn told Mississippi Today. “I think it will place too much of a burden on the city’s taxpayers. I believe it inhibits businesses from coming into the city. And it also hurts the efforts to retain and to expand businesses already here.”

Norwood told Mississippi Today he was “open-minded,” but that many of his constituents “have expressed disdain for (the sales tax increase), but I am still not done surveying it.”

Frazier told Mississippi Today he was still studying the possibility of the sales tax increase, “but I have not heard many positive comments about it from the folks in my district. They say it is regressive, and they already are paying an extra 1 cent for infrastructure.”

When asked if he supported the sales tax increase, Blount would not commit. “We are discussing all options, state and federal sources,” he said.

In another indication that the senators opposed the proposal: No one filed a Senate bill similar to Bell’s House bill that would garner legislative approval of the tax increase.

Lawmakers are working to end the current legislative session soon after this coming weekend, and it is unclear what funds, if any, they will appropriate to the city of Jackson. Republican leaders have remained tight-lipped as they are in closed-door meetings this week hammering out the state’s general fund budget.

The closing days of any legislative session are usually when lawmakers pass large packages that send state bonds to local governments. Neither Hosemann nor Gunn have publicly said they wouldn’t support a modest bond package for Jackson, and every lawmaker representing the city of Jackson in both the House and Senate support that effort.

Most residents of Jackson, Mississippi—the state's capital and largest city—have now gone an entire month without access to clean water in their homes, as a citywide boil water advisory remains in place after a historic winter storm last month, which crippled a water system Jackson officials said had been neglected for decades.

Key Facts

Boil water advisories first went out in Jackson on Feb. 16 after a massive winter storm and record-breaking cold took a major toll on infrastructure across the South. While other major water and power systems have managed to come back online across the region, testing in Jackson has continued to show the system isn't clear of potentially having dangerous organisms, leading to the boil water advisory remaining in place. Many residents went without access to running water at all or dealt with low water pressure after the winter storm, leading to distribution centers being set up for residents to retrieve water to bathe with or flush their toilets. Running water has been restored to nearly all residents, but a small number have continued to go without, according to the Clarion-Ledger. Officials hope to lift the boil water advisory in the coming days, the newspaper reported.

Big Number

43,000. That's how many households use the city's surface water system, all of whom have been asked to boil water before use. Those households—many of which having multiple people living under the same roof—represent much of the city's approximately 160,000 residents. A well-based water system serving about 16,000 customers in the southern part of Jackson and neighboring Byram, Mississippi, was cleared of the boil water advisory last week.

What To Watch For

City officials, including Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D), have blamed years of neglect and a declining tax base over the years caused by white flight as contributing to a water system that was ill-prepared for the winter weather. On March 3, Lumumba reportedly sent a letter to Gov. Tate Reeves (R) requesting $47 million to improve the city's water system.

Surprising Fact

Reeves has not yet put in a request for a federal disaster declaration, according to the Clarion-Ledger. He has until Sunday to do so.

Key Background

February brought a rare series of winter storms across the South and a deep freeze during the middle of the month which broke some record lows that had stood for more than a century. The record cold would take a heavy toll on infrastructure systems ill-prepared for those conditions. One of the clearest examples came from Texas, where the state's electrical grid was pushed to the brink of complete failure, leading to rolling blackouts for millions. The aftermath has seen political battles over the state's electrical grid, lawsuits over excessive electric bills and major electric companies filing for bankruptcy.

50,1 month ago,WBUR,"The Jackson, Mississippi Water Crisis And America's Crumbling Water System","""And the city itself, because, like so many cities in the U.S., because of flight, and disinvestment and losing the tax base. And in this case, losing 40,000 residents, taking us from 200,000 to 160,000. But we still have a huge land mass of city with these outdated pipes under them. So we can't pay, we can't afford to keep it up. ... It's a systemic breakdown of federal, state and local municipal areas being able to work together to solve problems together on basic things like infrastructure.""

Donna Ladd : “To use words that my reporter Nick Judin used, it's a complex system collapse. And when we say that, it's not just the technological part of the system. It's the fact that we've known this for years, it's coming in one way or another. I mean, we know it. There was a big 2013 study that warned about all of these things. So we know the conditions of them. But there's a systemic breakdown in the willingness to actually do something about it.

For a month, residents of Jackson, Mississippi went without clean running water. The city's mayor says the problem's decades in the making. That makes Jackson a lesson for the entire country. We talk America's crumbling water system.

What has the city of Jackson done over the past couple of decades to attend to this known problem?

Donna Ladd: “I think the best way to break it down is to say staunching the bleeding, Band-Aid approach as far as the city itself is concerned. I mean, I can't ... sit here and blame a city that is as beleaguered as our city has been for not having the resources to be able to overhaul the water system.

""Some of the numbers that we've come up with, the least amount that they need is $600 million. And then, as you said earlier, it keeps climbing from there. I mean, if the money's not here, the money's not here. So what that means is that the state should be at the same table with the city, side by side. This is the capital city.

“You know, the state is no stronger than its capital city. That's absurd. And so they should be side by side with the city saying, OK, how are we going to work together to get federal help? What is it that we can do? How can we help? But the opposite happens. You know, one of the things our governor said just recently was, Well, you know, Jackson residents should pay their water bill, so they should go collect the water bill.

""Well, there's a whole issue around faulty billing that we've been through. But beyond that, it's like the city tried to get the state, and the state legislature passed legislation to allow payment plans for the water bill. And the governor vetoed it last year. And so that's like working against us, and so the money doesn't come in. But the water billing money is not enough to pay for what we're talking about here.

""And we have to work with the federal government, as we've discovered. A lot of the disinvestment and helping municipal areas across the country came during the '80s and particularly the Reagan era. Which was kind of pulling back on financial assistance, for environmental improvements, those kinds of things. And that is one of those perfect storm moments where it got so much worse afterwards as far as not being able to pay for things. And so when you've got everybody working against each other, or ignoring each other, then it's a terrible situation.""

We keep using this phrase 'crumbling.' Is that a fair description of some of these water systems?

Aaron Packman: ""Most of the infrastructure we have in the eastern half of the United States is quite old. Just for point of comparison, I live in Chicago. We're still using the water intakes from Lake Michigan that were built in the 1960s. And in places like Philadelphia, the water infrastructure goes back 300 years. So clearly infrastructure that age needs a lot of maintenance to work properly. And it's very hard to do, because most of the pipes are underground and inaccessible. So we definitely have an issue with its aging, deteriorating water infrastructure in a lot of the country.”

Where should early targets be for the federal government if it's going to pump a whole lot of money into infrastructure?

Catherine Coleman-Flowers: “First of all, those people that never got the infrastructure should get it first. So, I mean, in this conversation we were talking about municipalities when most of the United States is rural. And most of them are not in municipalities. So should they still be denied access to infrastructure, especially water and wastewater infrastructure? And we're seeing in some places, I'm actually doing a project right now with The Guardian where we are documenting wastewater problems throughout the United States, it's not just a one situation. It's not just Jackson, Mississippi. It's not just even Detroit, which is having a lot of issues and water shut offs.

""And if we shut off the water, you shut off sanitation. And I think the other thing that we have to do is make sure that the policy makers, if we're going to have solutions, we cannot separate wastewater from water. Because a lot of people in their mind, because they can flush the toilets, they assume that everybody else in the U.S. can do the same thing. That's the reason why we were able to do a study to show that there was hookworm in Lowndes County. And it's probably in other areas, too. We just haven't looked for it yet. So that's the first thing we need to do, give it to places that don't have it.

""We also need to identify where those places are. There are no accurate numbers on how many people do not have wastewater sanitation, because that was taken off the census in the 1990s. So if we're going to make decisions based on what numbers we have, we're still going to leave a lot of people behind. And a lot of these people are in rural communities, or they are poor people or people of color. And we have to unpack and unfold that.

""And I think we can't talk about infrastructure, and where the dollars are going or where they have gone, unless we deal with the social justice issues around those decisions. Because to people who are not like me, they see it just as simply a political decision. But socially, it has an impact on people that look like me. And we need to make sure that our voices are heard and that part of the solution is getting those dollars to those communities that have been left behind.”

Aaron Packman: ""This is a rare opportunity, because you don't usually have these problems get elevated to the presidential level and a commitment to make an investment. So I would advocate for modernization of our wastewater treatment facilities, a lot of which used 50-year-old plus technology. And also fixing some of the hard problems with the water distribution system and also the wastewater system, the things that are less accessible, that often get ignored and are not fully maintained. So this will be expensive, but it will make a big difference.""

“All you’re trying to do is take the credit. Your people deserve more than that, the City deserves more than that. For 30 years, the City deserves more than that.”

Councilman Stokes fired back stating, “Is the mayor soft on crime because of his relationship with dope boys and or dope?”

But in the middle of the war of words lies the people of Jackson who have been dealing with a water crisis for 8 days.

“We got elderly people. We don’t have nothing. We aren’t worried about that bickering it’s nonsense. We need some help, that’s all we need.”

There were all smiles on the field during Jackson State's 53-0 win over Edward Waters on Sunday.

A COVID-limited sold out crowd of 11,000 fans showed up. The Tigers' defense anchored the program's first shutout since 2014. Even Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman showed up on the sidelines to support former Dallas Cowboys teammate Deion Sanders as he coached his first college football game.

There was just one noticeable issue inside of Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium - there was no running water.

The City of Jackson and surrounding areas have been without water or have experienced extremely low pressure for the greater part of the last two weeks since last week's winter storm rocked the state.

Jackson State's football stadium was no exception to the city's water crisis, as all attendees, media, players, coaches, fans and stadium workers alike had to use portable toilets. Aikman was seen carrying a jug of water into the stadium upon arrival.

The reality didn't hit Sanders until he received his Gatorade bath in the closing seconds of the win.

""(It was) cold, and sticky,"" Sanders said. ""The first thing that came to my mind is, 'We don't have a shower. We don't have water. We have a shower, but we don't have water.' That's the first thing that came to my mind.""

The Pro Football Hall of Famer said he expected the bath to come, so he prepared for the moment by bringing a fresh change of clothes.

""It was good though,"" Sanders said. ""Especially my kids enjoyed it the most. I think they enjoyed it the most. Just to share that first moment with your sons is incredible.""

As far as the actual game goes, Sanders said the stadium's water situation didn't bother his focus.

The coach said he was unsure if running water returned to the stadium on Tuesday afternoon.

56,"Feb 27, 2021",The Daily Beast,Frustrated Jackson Locals Are Nearing Two Weeks With No Water,"For nearly two weeks now, tens of thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi, have gone without running water in their homes, leaving them with no clean drinking water and unable to bathe, cook, wash clothes, or flush toilets.

For professional chef Enrika Williams, who lives in south Jackson with four other family members, it was a scramble when news began circulating around Valentine’s Day of an unexpected cold front where temperatures dropped into the teens.

Worried her pipes might freeze, quick-thinking Williams filled up her bathtub in case of such an event. Unfortunately for her and thousands of others, the unseasonably frigid weather caused the city’s outdated water equipment­–which can’t handle wintery conditions–to freeze and water lines to burst.

The result was dire, leading the city to issue a boil-water advisory and set up distribution sites for flushing water and bottled drinking water, with hundreds waiting in line with empty buckets for hours.

Williams would go the next 10 days with no running water in her home. She bought water wherever she could, shelling out $100 on bottled water to cook and clean with.

Nearby family members who happened to have water opened up their home so Williams, her mother, two siblings, and niece could wash their clothes and take a shower.

For flushable water, Williams had the idea to catch the melting snow from her home into waiting pails, as the weather soon turned a sunny 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

While Williams finally has water again, albeit trickling, she voiced her dissatisfaction with the city’s everchanging timeframe of when the water would be running again.

“The thing that became frustrating was the tone of accountability just wasn’t there,” Williams told The Daily Beast. “There was no plan that we could see. The press conferences were redundant. If you don’t know when it’s coming back, what is being done to help us?”

“There wasn’t anyone at the forefront who gave a damn, so to speak,” she added. “It makes you feel a lot of things. You just expect better.”

In Jackson, which has lost over 10 percent of its population since 2000, water problems are nothing new. Six years ago the city approved a 1 percent sales tax increase with the goal of updating all of its aging infrastructure, but the $15 million it generates annually is only a fraction of the $2 billion Mayor Chokwe Lumumba said the city will need. Long before the current crisis hit, one popular local t-shirt read “Welcome to Boil Water Alert, Mississippi.”

What’s different this time, residents say, is the sheer scale—the entire city is either without water or under a boil water alert.

“ It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives. ” — Laurie Bertram Roberts

More than a few residents have noted that the crisis has hit south and west Jackson hardest while leaving northeast Jackson, the one predominantly white corner of this 80 percent Black capital city, relatively unscathed. Over the past several days, Laurie Bertram Roberts, who runs the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, has used the fund to distribute more than 130 cases of water to residents, with plans to deliver another 80 tomorrow.

“Part of the problem is that it’s everywhere,” Roberts said. “Usually when we have an outage it’s in one neighborhood, so people are used to running over to their friends’ house or their auntie’s house to take a shower or fill up some jugs. Usually, you can grab your buckets and find some place to fill them, whatever. But when it’s the whole damn city? Where are the Black people supposed to go? It’s not like this is everywhere. It’s where the mostly Black population in Jackson lives.”

Jackson, which has a population of around 160,000, has a 26.9 percent poverty rate. Williams explained that a lot of people don’t have the resources to go out and buy additional water to cook and bathe with.

“People can’t afford that,” she said. “Water is a basic necessity and it just brought a lot of frustration, anger, and disappointment.”

“We aren’t out of the woods yet. There’s still a lot of people without water.”

While Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday night that he would “restore clean water” and send in the National Guard and tanker trucks with non-potable water in effort to relieve the issue, conditions still hadn’t improved by Saturday.

Fed-up locals flooded the city’s Facebook page to demand answers.

“Day 12 and not even a drip at my house,” Dwight Pugh wrote. “NEVER have we had disrupted this long.”

“It’s clear that the city government doesn’t have the resources or the ability to manage things, and they’re getting worse, rather than better,” John Zer added.

“It’s been two weeks and I know families with infants who don’t have water. The city needs help,” Jamario Townsend chimed in. “I’m thankful my water is trickling out enough to flush my toilet but dang. This just needs to be fixed at this point. It just needs to be fixed.”

Many directed their anger towards Democratic Mayor Chokwe Lumumba, who had pleaded with his constituents to have “patience” while admitting there was “no definitive timeline as to when the water will be restored within the tanks.”

“ This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents. ” — Mayor Chokwe Lumumba

Accused of being too slow to reach out to Reeves for assistance, Lumumba claimed the Republican governor wouldn’t return any of his phone calls. Reeves’ camp quickly fired back that the governor had no missed calls from Lumumba.

In a statement to The Daily Beast, Mayor Lumumba said, “The challenges of aging infrastructure are not new to Jackson, but this is different. This was an act of God that sent old systems into havoc resulting in severe water outages and trauma for our residents.”

“Our systems were never meant to endure days of ice storms and sub-zero temperatures coupled by road conditions that prevented the delivery of critical supplies,” he added. “It has been a difficult few weeks. Our recovery efforts continue. We are not there yet, but we are doing everything we can to restore water to Jackson residents.”

Reeves seems to agree, saying earlier in the week that Jackson’s water systems problems date back to “50 years of negligence and ignoring the challenges of the pipes and the system.”

57,1 month ago,WJTV,Jackson firefighters battle water problems during apartment fire,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Six families are out of their homes tonight after a fire ripped through their apartment building in Jackson. One boy is being hailed a hero for warning families. But concerns over poor city infrastructure center may have impacted how fire crews responded.

Witnesses described the fire breaking out a little after 10:00 a.m. on the first floor of a building at the West Ridge apartments off O’ferrel Ave. Thanks to neighbors working together everyone got out in time with little injuries.

Nine-year-old Kadarious Brown found himself in a dangerous situation as flames spread throughout the side of the complex he lived on. But it didn’t stop him from helping neighbors.

“When I knocked on the door there were just two people there,” Kadarious Brown said. “But the other two rooms no one was in. They’re all gone.”

In the aftermath, the whole building sat in ruins after flames spread from the center first-floor apartment to the second floor. Families lost everything.

“TVs, my bed clothes, lamps, basically everything was in that apartment,” Debbie Barnes told us.

To notify firefighters one person from the complex chose to run down to the fire station next to the zoo. When crews arrived people noticed they had problems getting enough water to come out of the closest fire hydrant.

“They did have to go to multiple fire hydrants to try to find water to get what they need,” Latoya Moore stated. “But they did what they needed to do to tend to the fire. It would have been very good for that fire hydrant to work but it didn’t because we all know how Jackson is right now.”

The Assistant Fire Chief told us only one main water line runs down O’ferrel Ave. Which was operating as usual, but between four different hoses, including the ladder hose, the water volume couldn’t keep up.

“That hydrant is not going to supply that,” Assistant Chief Patrick Armon said. “Actually that main is not going to supply that. When you catch two hydrants that are on the same line it’s basically like you’re catching one hydrant because it’s the same like that’s underground.”

The ladder hose alone requires up to 500 gallons of water per minute to power it fully. Breaking down their response firefighters believe it wouldn’t have made a difference if they set it up differently.

At the end of the day, authorities and renters are grateful no one was hurt and commend all those for helping with what resources they had. Mississippi red cross is working to help those with nowhere to go. The landlord hopes to rebuild.","(WJTV) – Six families are out of their homes tonight after a fire ripped through their apartment building in Jackson.

65,1 month ago,BuzzFeed News,"In Jackson, Mississippi, You Can Go Into Debt Trying To Take A Shower","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative. They avoided using the bathroom as much as possible, and when they couldn’t hold it anymore, they stretched black trash bags across the toilet to capture waste and then poured in bleach. They boiled bottled water to cook, and they used baby wipes to clean their bodies. But on day five, Robinson, a single mother, faced the inevitable: She needed to shower to go to work, and that meant overdrafting her bank account by $500 to cover six nights in a hotel outside of town.

In February, freezing temperatures knocked out power and water across the Southeast, leaving millions of people scrambling to stay warm and unable to access basic supplies for days. But in Jackson, most of the city’s 160,000 residents, 82% of whom are Black, were without safe, reliable water for more than a month. It marked the latest chapter in years of issues with a brittle and decaying water system, and highlights the deep vulnerability of aging infrastructure — a problem from Flint, Michigan, to Sandbranch, Texas, and Newark, New Jersey — as extreme weather becomes more routine with climate change.

The recent water crisis has been especially devastating for Black women like Robinson, who is the sole provider for her family. People working in shops and restaurants lost entire paychecks when their workplaces closed due to lack of water. Kids couldn’t go to school or daycare, so parents had to shell out extra money for food and babysitters. They had to divert money away from rent or other bills to buy bottled water and cover the costs associated with being unable to bathe, do laundry, or cook in their own homes.

“It’s everyday life to me. I don’t know how else to describe it because I am so used to surviving that way,” Robinson said. “As far as our Black culture, it’s our culture, what people say is resilience, it’s just us.”

The water is flowing again in Jackson. But for Robinson and others who are barely getting by, the empty taps left debt and new worries about the future. Years of neglect of the water system had already brought poor service and outrageous bills. In the face of a changing climate, the problems can only get worse, and so far, residents have had to pay the price.

Jackson, the capital of the poorest, Blackest state in the nation, has been flailing for a long time. Decades of white flight and mismanagement, coupled with broken, antiquated infrastructure, have hampered its growth and thus its ability to revitalize itself. City leaders have estimated it would cost around $2 billion, though they recently asked the state for $47 million, to fix its water systems, which, due to a meager pool of public funds, it just can’t do. And the state has historically refused to step in and help, with Gov. Tate Reeves last month calling on the city to collect overdue bills from locals before seeking state support. The governor’s office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News. City officials, and experts who advise them, have argued that the water system’s ratepayers simply cannot shoulder those massive costs.

“What is on the line is really overwhelming,” Dominika Parry, a climate economist who lives in Jackson and founded 2CMississippi, a nonprofit climate change action group, explained to BuzzFeed News. “It’s a failure of lack of support from the state. And when you have a concentration of Black families who are low-income…and a state that refuses to acknowledge climate change, it’s not a sustainable situation, and we are seeing the consequences.”

It’s people like Robinson who have to “take it,” the climate economist said. This time, that meant a hefty hotel bill and overdraft fees. The next disaster could be worse, she added.

“When we have floods, hurricanes, and heat, those who can’t afford to leave die.”

Robinson has lived in Jackson for 22 years, and she and thousands of other residents have grown used to their pipes bursting or sputtering out dark liquid, as well as random shutoffs, while still getting hit with high and inconsistent bills. They’ve grown accustomed to having to boil their water, knowing that the lead in their corroded systems might still poison them, and watching sewage bubble up in their backyards.

Officials have for years warned pregnant residents and children under 5 not to drink the tap water. The city sends boil water notices about five times a year and shuts taps off entirely when a water main busts. On top of that, residents have to bear the brunt of a broken billing system that became even more of a debacle after former mayor Harvey Johnson signed a contract with Siemens Inc. and several subcontractors in 2012 who, according to a lawsuit later filed by the city, manipulated the rules to jack up prices and further gouge Jackson for water.

City officials reached a $89.8 million settlement last March, but residents are still dealing with sporadic and spiked bills. After not getting a bill for about a year, Ronnie Crudup Jr., a state representative who was born and raised in Jackson, went to the department in person to see what was going on and found that he owed $2,500 for water, he told BuzzFeed News.

“Water bills are all over the place. $1,500 up to $10,000. We don’t fully know the true costs,” he said. “People are suing the city because they don’t believe their water bills are accurate. People are not getting bills and people can’t pay the percentage of the bill they need to. As a result, we’re not collecting.”

Then came February’s storms, a new crisis that no one had expected would leave the city waterless for so long, nor the financial ramifications it would continue to have for residents who were already struggling.

Robinson makes $16,800 a year as a teacher’s assistant for students with special needs in the Lincoln County School District, about $21,000 less than the state’s median income. It’s her purpose, she said, to nurture the students “so many people sweep under the rug,” but that small paycheck makes supporting her own kids a constant, stressful calculation.

If she “budgets right,” Robinson can manage to feed her family of three for just $100 a week and then sets aside $180 for electricity, $80 for gas, and $1,000 for rent each month. And for all the years she’s lived in Jackson, water has always been an issue, so she’s factored that in. Despite having a filtration system and setting aside about $120 to pay a chunk of her bill, she still spends about $40 to $50 on bottled water monthly.","When the water in Jackson, Mississippi, shut off, Gwen Robinson and her daughters tried to cope by getting creative.

Is water back on in Jackson?

All Jackson water customers now have water running through their faucets although some areas of the city are still experiencing low water pressure, Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday.

Williams said he determined residents are getting water from checking with residents in areas where shortages were occurring and gauging the water pressure in nearby fire hydrants.

Jackson is still under a boil notice

A majority of Jackson's water customers remain under a citywide boil water notice, meaning the water is still unsafe to drink or use for other common activities such as brushing teeth unless it is boiled first.

The about 43,000 customers on the surface water system might see the boil water notice lifted this week, provided the city is able to sample the water supply on two consecutive days.

The city last week lifted a notice on the 16,000 customers who receive their water from the city's well system. Those customers live in parts of south Jackson and Byram.

There is still no federal disaster declaration in Mississippi as the city of Jackson enters the fourth week of its water crisis.

Gov. Tate Reeves has until to submit Sunday a declaration to the White House and FEMA.

Several southern states have been approved for emergency declarations that open the door for federal assistance amid recovery from brutal winter storms that knocked out power and water services to millions in February.

The pipe broke during freezing temperatures brought by last week's winter weather.

JACKSON, MS (AP) — The sunshine is back, and the ice has melted. But more than a week after a deep freeze across the South, many communities are still grappling with getting clean water to their residents.

Families stood in lines for hours to get drinking water. They boiled it to make it safe to drink or brush their teeth. They scooped up snow and melted it in their bathtubs. Hospitals collected buckets of water to flush toilets.

“You don’t realize how much you use water until you don’t have it,” said Brian Crawford, chief administrative officer for the Willis-Knighton Health System in the northwestern Louisiana city of Shreveport, where water pressure at one hospital only started returning to normal Wednesday. Tanker trucks had supplied it with water since last week.

For years, experts have warned of the need to upgrade aging and often-neglected waterworks. Now, after icy weather cracked the region’s water mains, froze equipment and left millions without service, it’s clear just how much work needs to be done.

The still-unfolding problems have exposed extensive vulnerabilities. Many water systems have decades-old pipes, now fragile and susceptible to breaking. White flight dropped tax revenue in some cities, and a lack of investment has caused problems to become even costlier to fix. Many systems in the South were not built with such low temperatures in mind. But with climate change projected to bring more extreme weather, problems like those seen last week could return.

A 2018 survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure. In a 2020 report, the American Society of Civil Engineers said a water main breaks every two minutes on average in the U.S., and described “chronic, long-term and insufficient investment.” The report warned that the “nation’s public health and the economy will be at risk.""

Actually, it's already happening.

The Mississippi capital of Jackson struggled to fix its damaged water grid, with thousands still facing outages. In Memphis, residents in the city of 650,000 were told for nearly a week to boil water for three minutes if they planned to use it for drinking, cooking or brushing their teeth. The boil-water advisory was lifted Thursday. Nearly 25,000 Louisianans still had water outages Thursday, and hundreds of thousands more were under boil advisories.

In Texas, more than 2 million remained under boil water notices Wednesday and 40 public water systems are “nonoperational,” affecting 25,000 people, state officials said. At the height of the problems last week, at least 7 million Texans were told to boil their water. The order was finally lifted Sunday for Houston, where millions had endured power and water outages in the nation's fourth-largest city that is more accustomed to hurricanes than winter storms.

As temperatures fell below freezing across the South, residents kept their faucets open to prevent pipes from freezing. But the increased demand taxed the already struggling systems, and the low water pressure meant that boil advisories were needed until safety tests could be completed.

Charles Williams, director of public works for the city of Jackson, said that as frozen machinery at the water plant began to thaw with rising temperatures, dozens of water mains broke.

Old pipes in the city have a history of breaking after cold weather, but a declining tax base has Jackson struggling to maintain its infrastructure. Following integration, affluent white families moved to the suburbs, taking their tax dollars with them. Now, more than a quarter of residents in Mississippi’s majority-Black capital live in poverty.

James Williams, 67, went eight days without water at his house and called Jackson’s water problem a public health crisis.

“The wealthy taxpayers left, so they left Jackson to suffer,” the retired public works department employee said. “It’s not their concern because they don’t live here no more.”

Voters in 2014 overwhelmingly approved an extra 1% sales tax for infrastructure repairs, but the $15 million a year raised is only a fraction of what Jackson needs. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said close to $2 billion is required to modernize its water system.

“These pipes are, described by the people who jump in the holes to repair them, like peanut brittle,” he said. “They’ll repair a pipe in one area and just sit back and wait, and sometimes they’ll see a break happen almost immediately a few yards away.”

Monday was the first time in a week that residents could line up for water outside of Madonna Manor, a 13-floor apartment complex for seniors and people with disabilities. People brought laundry pails, bowls, buckets and wastebaskets.

Helen Scott, 68, collecting water in a pink trash can, said people with cars can leave to get water, but those who have the least are struggling the most.

“The vulnerable are left behind,” she said.

In Shreveport, where about 200,000 people were being told to boil their water, Mayor Adrian Perkins pointed to “old, aging infrastructure, just like most American cities.”

Voters in 2019 rejected Perkins’ bond proposal to raise $186 million for infrastructure, including water system repairs and upgrades.

In Tennessee, Memphis Light, Gas & Water said the cold led to problems at pumping stations and ruptures in water mains and service lines. Crews were making repairs and testing for contaminants, but no timetable has been set for a return to normal service.

Problems arose at some of the city’s 140 wells that deliver water to reservoirs at eight main pumping stations. Wells failed, several reservoirs froze and engines and motors at pumping stations overheated. The persistent freezing temperatures exposed problems at pumping stations and other parts of the system, some of which dates to the 1930s.

The utility is in the second year of a five-year, $105 million plan to update and strengthen infrastructure. At a news conference Tuesday, utility President and CEO J.T. Young said the plan will be reassessed in light of the recent freeze to make sure it matches the needs that have arisen.","A 2018 survey by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated $473 billion was needed over 20 years to maintain and improve water infrastructure.

69,1 month ago,WJTV,Mississippi Moment: Jackson’s Water Crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – On Tuesday, we asked your opinion about whether the state should help the City of Jackson solve its water problems. The overwhelming response was ‘no.’

Years ago, I was interviewing former Governor William Winter on the occasion of his law firm moving into new quarters in Downtown Jackson. Now, this was at a time when the fashionable business trend was to relocate to places like somewhere along Highland Colony in Madison County and out of the city.

So I asked Mr. Winter why they chose to stay put in Jackson. He said that in their opinion, the Capital City is the preeminent city of the state, and their law firm was affirming its long time commitment to Jackson firstly. In doing so, it was affirming their commitment to the State of Mississippi by supporting its Capital City.

As goes Jackson, so goes the state.

We have some very progressive metropolitan areas in Mississippi: Tupelo, Hattiesburg, the Coast and Oxford. In the end, their ultimate success will be dictated by the success of the Capital City, to one degree or another.

Now, realizing that Mississippi can no more afford to fix Jackson’s infrastructure than the city itself. At the same time, the image of the entire state is tied to Jackson, because the rest of the state exists in the shadow of the Capital City.

I don’t have any solutions here, but I do want to point out that while there a great temptation to say, ‘Jackson got itself into this situation, let them get themselves out,’ the problems in Jackson are state problems. As long as our Capital City has the image of being less than first class, the entire state has to live in the shadow of that.

So let’s set aside assigning blame and start finding and embracing solutions to the water issue and all of the other issues holding us back.","(WJTV) – On Tuesday, we asked your opinion about whether the state should help the City of Jackson solve its water problems.

73,1 month ago,WJTV,12 News Investigates: Former Mayor Yarber on Jackson’s water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – In 2017, Jackson was met with pipe problems. The city had to repair a 48 inch pipe in Northwest Jackson.

“When we had to fix the big water main out on 220, and it was a situation where we had to shut the city down for about a period of about 72 hours. It was really challenging, but we saw people pull together during that time and make things happen for us,” said former Jackson Mayor Tony Yarber.

He said during his time as mayor from 2014 to 2017, there were troubles with not only the underground piping, but issues with the distribution systems at times, the plant itself and lead leaching. In 2017, he played a role in an opportunity with the state.

“They would become contributors to the city’s infrastructure through the Capitol Complex, a bill that was passed. So the city should be getting about $11 to $13 million per year of work being invested in the city based on that,” said Yarber.

He said fixing the infrastructure will take time because after years, the problems have exacerbated.

“There was no investment in the 1980s, the 1970s into infrastructure, and so what you see is the cascading effecting on the city’s leadership and the city’s coffers.”

In 2014 as mayor, Tony Yarber created an infrastructure plan and secured federal funding for State Street and West County Line Road projects. He said the city leadership has to take a real lead on how they’ll reach out to state and federal resources and work together.","(WJTV) – In 2017, Jackson was met with pipe problems.

75,"Mar 17, 2021",Democracy Now!,"Jackson Mayor Demands Help After Month-Long Water Crisis Amid Pandemic, Racism, Broken Infrastructure","This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month. On the pandemic front, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to open up vaccine eligibility to all residents over age 16. Twenty percent of adults in Mississippi has received at least one dose of a vaccine. Public health experts are urging residents to keep wearing masks, even though the state’s Republican governor has lifted the statewide mask mandate, and to regularly wash their hands — something that’s been hard to do for the past month in Jackson, the state’s capital, which has gone five weeks without safe drinking water.

The deadly February winter storm that left most of Texas without power for days also devastated other Southern states. In Jackson, the freezing temperatures burst pipes and water mains, leaving most of Jackson without reliable access to running water. While water delivery has largely been restored, “boil water” orders remain in effect for most residents.

The crisis highlights how climate change threatens much of the nation’s aging infrastructure. For Jackson, there are no easy solutions. The city estimates it could cost $2 billion to fix the city’s water system, but Jackson is a poor city in the poorest state in the country. The city is 82% Black, while the state Legislature is majority white. White politicians have openly suggested Jackson’s problems are because of its Black leadership. Mississippi’s Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann criticized Jackson’s handling of the crisis by saying, quote, “You remember during Kane Ditto’s administration, he did repair work on water and sewer. So what happened since then?” Kane Ditto was Jackson’s last white mayor.

Donna Ladd of the Jackson Free Press recently wrote, quote, “Make no mistake, the fact that low-income Jacksonians are living amid the stench of toilets that won’t flush is a direct legacy of white-supremacist thinking at the state level, not the failure of a few bill collectors in the city to collect on enough delinquent customers.”

We go now to Jackson, Mississippi, where we’re joined by Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba. He has served as mayor since 2017. His father, Chokwe Lumumba, also briefly served as mayor before dying unexpectedly in 2014 eight months into his first term.

Mayor, it’s great to have you back on Democracy Now! Your city is facing a massive crisis — two. Of course, you’re dealing, like the whole country, with the coronavirus pandemic. And at the same time, you haven’t had clean drinking water for a month. Can you explain what’s happening and what needs to be done?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Yes. First, Amy, thank you for having me again, and thank you for lifting up this issue.

What we suffered after the two winter storms — and I need to make certain that I clarify that, that we had two consecutive storms that took place, leaving us in prolonged low temperatures in the city of Jackson, historically low temperatures in the city of Jackson. And what it did was it created complications getting water into our treatment facility. The raw water screens are at the inception point of the water treatment facility, in which they froze. And because we couldn’t get water in, it complicated or made it impossible for us to clean water and get water out, leaving our distribution system compromised. And as consumption was high, it drained many of the tanks across the city. And our PSI — our water treatment facility operates off of hydraulics. The PSI went down to 37. We need our PSI at about 90 in order to distribute water throughout the system.

This is on account of an aged, aging infrastructure of a legacy city, money which has not been contributed over time, while the city of Jackson contributes millions of dollars each and every year, and has done so since Kane Ditto, before Kane Ditto, and continues to do so. What we have not is had a state leadership that identifies this as not just a city of Jackson problem, but a ongoing and shared problem of not only the city, but the state. And I’d like to just emphasize that in a few ways, if I could, Amy.

One, the city of Jackson is the largest city by a factor of three, the highest contributor to revenue to the state. We are the state capital, which means that many of our properties are untaxable. We do not get payment in lieu of taxes. Furthermore, we provide water to state facilities at no cost to the state of Mississippi. So, if they just paid their water bill, the city of Jackson would be in a lot better position.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Mayor, I wanted to ask you — for the brief time that your father was in office, one of the things that he was praised for was attempting to address the infrastructure problem. As I recall, he tried to institute a new tax to provide better infrastructure services. What’s been the problem between the — you mentioned one aspect, the state not paying its water bill — but in terms of being able to implement upgrades of the system?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, I think that you would have to understand the comprehensive infrastructure problem in the city of Jackson. The 1% sales tax generates about $13 million annually. And when I said $2 billion, I didn’t say $2 billion for the water system; I said comprehensively. The way we know that is that the EPA has estimated that our wastewater problem is about a billion dollars, where sewage is coming up in people’s yards and in their backyards and in ditches, and those issues. So, that’s one. That’s before we get to the drinking water, which we see the crisis that we have on our hands after the February storms. That doesn’t get to the drainage. We suffered a 30-year flood just recently, this past — in 2020. So, that doesn’t get to the issue of how drainage is — how people address that. And that doesn’t get to roads and bridges and all of these things, all these parts of our infrastructure that our residents rely on. So, $13 million is just insufficient to meet the need.

The city of Jackson was not ill-prepared based on the winter storms; we were ill-equipped. And so, this is because resources are often stripped from the city of Jackson. Not only are we not met with a consistent plan in order to support the city that supports the state of Mississippi; we don’t enjoy the commensurate support that the city provides the state. But also, we’ve had resources stripped away from us. You referenced the conversation, or you referenced the statements of Lieutenant Governor Delbert Hosemann. As we have lifted up these issues year after year in our legislative agenda, understanding that it’s not a matter of if these infrastructure systems will fail, but when, he redirected the conversation to talk about the state’s effort to take over the city of Jackson’s airport, which is a profitable institution that we rely on year after year.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And how difficult has it been for the residents of your city to deal with the water situation while at the same time contending with the issues around the COVID pandemic?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, as you can imagine, our residents have made every endeavor to be as patient as they could. But the frustrations are high. You know, as you can imagine, when people want to drink water, cook with water, not only bathe but get rid of waste, people being concerned about not only the safety precautions of the pandemic but also taking medications, simple things like that, that they anticipate that water will help serve the need to do those things, it has been extremely difficult.

And so, you know, I do want to lift up the many people across the city, individuals, businesses, people from around the country, who have stood in the gap, rallied around the city of Jackson to distribute water. Each one of us have spent countless hours out making certain that we got water to the elderly, to the immobile, to the disabled. And so, while there has been great frustration around these issues, these are issues that the residents of Jackson have dealt with for quite some time, and so they’re very familiar, they’re intimately familiar, with the history of divestment, the history of a lack of investment from the state, very familiar with the woes and troubles of our water infrastructure and our infrastructure in a comprehensive way, as well.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to go to Calandra Davis, a policy analyst at Hope Policy Institute. She has been delivering bottled water and food to those without water supply.

CALANDRA DAVIS: The communities that was hardest hit by this water crisis are in South and West Jackson, which, again, are the predominantly or majority Black and Brown communities in the city. So, again, it just shows that it wasn’t just another bad weather day for us, that this has been, again, years of neglect to the majority Black and Brown parts of the city, also just another example of how structural racism works.

AMY GOODMAN: So, can you explain how people are getting water? I mean, if people can’t afford to buy water, how do they get to places where water is, or have to go to pick it up? One older woman described the only thing she could get was little bottled water. This is to keep themselves clean. It’s not just for drinking.

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, you know, along with the complication of a water treatment facility essentially crashing during the storm, we also had the challenge for several days because roads were iced over and the transportation or distribution system was interrupted on our highways. And so, it became complicated because the local stores didn’t have water anymore. It became complicated because — it was increasingly challenging because trucks could not come and deliver water. But we were able to manage through that and set up distribution sites across the city. The state National Guard did set up tanks around the city for non-potable water, for people to come with containers and utilize. As I mentioned, you had several businesses, several individuals, that stood in the gap in order to support people in that way.

I do want to lift up the issue that Ms. Davis spoke to: the equity issues. You know, it is not a system where you turn on water from one area of town or another area of town. The system distributes water through the lines that were laid, actually, more than a hundred years ago. The problem is an issue of equity. We just have to understand when the take took place. The take happened, or the issues of people who are in poverty or don’t have the resources not being able to get the water, is because they live in areas that were not valued as high or as more desirable by those who had money. Those who had money built homes near — closest to the resources, closer to the water treatment facilities. Therefore, when water is redistributed through the distribution system, through the lines, they are the ones who get water sooner. When you get to South and West Jackson, those are the areas furthest away from the plant. Those are the areas at higher elevations across the city, which means that the water not only has to travel far, but it has to travel high. It has to go up those high elevation points.

And so, you know, we must lift up not only how we build sustainable infrastructure, but how we do it in an equitable way, looking at these issues and looking at how we address those areas through city planning. And city planning is never neutral. City planning is not by mistake. We have to be able to make sure that we do this in a way that creates dignity for all residents across our city.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Mayor, on this issue of equitable distribution of resources and services, years ago, your father pioneered the Jackson-Kush Plan, an attempt to empower African Americans in the majority area, geographical areas of the South. How do you assess the progress that’s been made, beginning with his administration, but then going through yours, in terms of spreading this idea of the equitable distribution of resources?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, that is a movement that is ongoing. And we have many successes to point to in that regard. What our goal is, is to democratize power, understanding that issues of infrastructure, that we need to be able to connect, pothole to pothole, in community to community, so people in Jackson, Mississippi, understand why there’s a community that looks just like theirs in Jamaica, Queens, New York, in Gary, Indiana, or Detroit, Michigan. In that process of fixing that pothole, in that process of how we repair our infrastructure in terms of water, what we ultimately learn is that the pothole was never your problem in the first place. Your problem is that you don’t control the decision-making process that leads to the pothole being fixed.

And so, we do that by having people’s assemblies where we engage community. We do that by participatory budgeting, understanding that the budget of the city is a moral document, and if we don’t listen to the community, listen to what the community needs and scratch where they may be itching, then it reflects what our values are as a community. We’ve done that through making sure that we extend a model which is just and transparent as we look at the issues of public safety and policing, not only making sure that we have a police ID task force populated by the community, so that they can work alongside the police department and understand how public safety must look. And so, we’ve done that in a number of ways. We’re are looking at that in terms of economic mobility and economic development in the community, understanding that we want to be a business-friendly city, but we also understand that it has to be a reciprocal relationship. And so, we lift up cooperative business models, as well, so that we can learn how we can fill the gaps.

Even as we have this conversation about water and the issue of water over the last month or so, the reality is that every effort in order to support the infrastructure of the city of Jackson has been undertaken by the residents, by the people, more than the state itself. The decision to tax themselves more in order to help the infrastructure was supported over 90% by the residents. The state isn’t filling in the gap or standing in the gap when people decide to tax themselves more. Those are people taking the issue in their own hands, realizing that we are who we’ve been waiting on. And so, we should be met in that way.

AMY GOODMAN: Mayor, very quickly, Mississippi has become the second state in the nation to offer vaccines to everyone above 16. At the same time, the mask mandate has been lifted. The significance of this for your city, for Jackson?

MAYOR CHOKWE ANTAR LUMUMBA: Well, it’s a contradictory message, and I believe that it is dangerous. While we are happy that we can expand the opportunity for people to be vaccinated, every health professional that I have listened to, all the health professionals we listen to nationally, have indicated that it is just too soon in order to lift the mask mandate.

The city of Jackson, we execute our COVID policy based on science, not politics. And so, we will maintain our mask mandate in the city of Jackson. However, the state’s decision to do otherwise still puts us in a compromised position, because we’re not only the capital city, we’re the capital of healthcare. What that means is, is as surrounding cities may not issue the mask mandate, when their residents, unfortunately, fall victim to the virus, they will overburden our hospitals in the city of Jackson, leaving not only our residents in greater danger, but those individuals who seek hospitalization or seek medical attention for a myriad of other issues, even outside of COVID. And so, I think that it is contradictory. I think that it is confusing. And I think that it is ill-timed.

AMY GOODMAN: Chokwe Antar Lumumba, we thank you so much for being with us, mayor of Jackson, Mississippi, longtime activist.

Next up, Deb Haaland is being sworn in as secretary of the interior, becoming the first Native American to serve in a U.S. presidential cabinet. We’ll look at what she faces when it comes to the legacy of uranium mines. Stay with us.","AMY GOODMAN: We begin today’s show in Jackson, Mississippi, where residents are facing two public health crises: the COVID pandemic and almost no clean drinking water for more than a month.

that the people who work on these, who work on these pipes or tanks or, or, you know, what have you, are, not the individuals who installed this system a long time ago, but they're doing everything that they can, uh, to keep an age system running. I want to assure the residents that we are making investments into a better water system. We continue to reiterate that we need help from the state and federal government to meet us. Uh, but just recently we passed a $7 million dollar uh, issuance to generate a new pipe that will serve as South Jackson. Not only is South Jackson challenge in terms of the distance, uh, the height, uh, the elevation of South Jackson, and that challenges that that area of our city, uh, when it, when it pertains to, uh, issues within our distribution line, uh, but also the pipe was not sufficient to service that area. And so we're looking at how we generate more water and more water pressure to the area. And that was a $7 million investment. So, we want people to know that the city is investing right. Uh, the city is investing, that's, that's more than double What the state gave us, uh, in an allocation once we said we needed 47 million. So the city is putting our money where our mouth is. Uh, and we look forward to everyone else continuing to hear what we need and continuing to recognize that when you fail to do this, uh, it isn't based on, you know, we don't have democrat or Republican pipes. Uh, we have pipes that serve mothers and fathers and sons and daughters and businesses. That's the type of water we provide. Uh, and so what you do for the residents of Jackson, you truly do in a more humane and global sense. And so we ask that you join us. Uh huh. Furthermore, there was an issue that took place this weekend. Sometimes things happen that are completely uh un foreseeable. Uh there was a truck that hit a a fire hydrant which also led to some disruption uh in the distribution system. And so uh that was repaired as quickly as it could be. Uh but these are the things that even in the best of circumstances when you prepare as much as you can see, there are some things that happen outside of all of our control additionally, and this will be my last point with respect to these issues uh is that the city is looking at technology uh as we are in the business of replacing our our our water meters we are visiting or contemplating uh the idea of technology that could allow us to potentially be more proactive as it relates to impending leaks, cracks uh long before they become ruptures within our system. Uh But we are doing our homework and due diligence to see whether that is the the direction we need to go uh uh issue of a little bit of a different variety but nonetheless still related. Uh There has been uh some inaccuracy in some reporting uh as it relates to low water pressure uh and affecting our Jackson uh Fire department. Uh and so we want to set the record straight uh you know, and and really speak to the process by which water is actually taken from the hydrant into the truck and the truck then uh you know, issues out the water. Uh but I want to invite someone to the podium that can speak to it a lot more fluently and eloquently than I can. And that is a deputy or assistant chief. Uh Patrick Martin, thank you. Okay afternoon. Oh again, my name is Patrick Long and Assistant chief. And speaking to what the mayor I just said, I want to reiterate, what are you saying about water pressure? Not being the issue here is not as of right now and not in the past. Even when we were at the height of the water crisis, we on the fire Department didn't have any issues with water. And this came up because over the past couple of days or weeks we've had numerous fires to where at the scenes, I'm hearing a lot of people saying, being said that Fire department couldn't actually fight the fire because they didn't have to work person. And and speaking with my guys on the scene, I'm finding out that that's absolutely not the case. And we wanted to make sure that the public is getting uh factual information and we don't want to hide any type of fear in the public, making them think that they are not safe from five.

While the Mississippi city of Jackson works to fully restore water, various community organizations have been filling in the gaps with relief. Mutual aid is a new term for some, but providing it is an old practice in many Black communities.

“As a southern Black girl, who grew up in rural Mississippi, mutual aid has always existed in my life,” Calandra Davis, an organizer with the Jackson chapter of Black Youth Project 100 (BYP 100), told NewsOne. Davis said community institutions have always provided aid in times of need. “The churches [and families] in my community always provided mutual aid,” she added.

Providing support to communities in Jackson and across the state, the Mississippi Rapid Response & Relief Coalition is a statewide coalition, including rural partners. Member organizations include the Mississippi Poor People’s Campaign, the People’s Advocacy Institute, the Milestone Cooperative, Mississippi M.O.V.E., Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition, BYP 100 and Sarah’s Touch.

Davis said the organizations took on various roles in the storm’s aftermath, each finding its own lane.

“Some people were preparing and delivering food,” Davis explained. “Others were helping to find water and get it out to people.”

She said BYP 100 helped get money into the hands and pockets of people who lost income.

“We also secured hotels for folks who were without power and water,” Davis shared.

Members of the coalition were engaged in community outreach work even before the current water crisis.

“We take a holistic approach,” Sharon Brown, founder and executive director of the Council of Sisterhood, a philanthropic organization, said. “[Our] work didn’t shift, it became harder because we couldn’t get the supplies that we needed to provide for the people in the community.”

Brown said she founded the Council of Sisterhood in 2013 with her sister Valerie Brown.

“We started the organization because we saw the needs of our community not being met because of systemic racism,” Brown explained. She said that her organization has provided everything from clothing to food and even money to help pay utility bills.

“The village is only as strong as the members,” said Brown. “And so if you have one family hurting, then the whole community hurts and suffers.”

The current crisis comes as communities continue to deal with COVID-19. Mississippi is one of two states that recently lifted pandemic restrictions put in place to protect public health and safety.

The disregard for Black lives has been clear even before the pandemic, but existing through the layered crisis has been a real eye-opener for some people.

“We’re really just seeing environmental issues and racism paired together,” Davis said. “And [there are] no real systemic solutions are being offered.”

Rukia Lumumba agreed with Davis and framed the current crisis as a part of a larger challenge.

“Over the last few years, we’ve just been seeing the weather changes become more significant,” Lumumba said in an interview with NewsOne. “And it has consistently harmed our communities, more so than any other community.”

Lumumba is the founder and executive director of the People’s Advocacy Institute, an organization she envisioned alongside her father, the late Mayor Chokwe Lumumba. She is also the older sister of Jackson’s current mayor, Chokwe Antar Lumumba. At its core, the People’s Advocacy Institute is a community capacity-building and training organization. Lumumba and her team, along with partner organizations, work to uplift impacted communities.

While the city has set up local distribution sites, Lumumba sees the grassroots relief effort as people stepping up to do what needs to be done. She said once the roads were safe, some people drove as long as two hours to find water.

As a part of the Rapid Response and Relief Coalition, Lumumba and the People’s Advocacy Institute fielded requests for food or hotel assistance, water distribution and even money.

“We’ve seen a decline in people asking for hotels,” Lumumba explained. “But now we’ve seen an increase in people asking for financial assistance to cover everything that they lost.”

From pipe repairs and fixing other related damage to buying groceries, people have incurred additional expenses because of the winter weather and water outage.

She said the groups have provided support in Jackson and the greater Hind County area as well as several rural communities from the Mississippi Delta to communities in central and northern Mississippi.

“The collective effort is critical to our sustainability,” said Lumumba. “Our livelihood [and] our ability to survive is intertwined with our ability to work together.”

Lumumba recounted the first week of the winter storm that left highways closed and services disrupted all over.

“Prior to this, anytime there were any major weather changes, our water system was in jeopardy of shutting down in certain areas of town,” explained Lumumba.

She said this impacted South and West Jackson more than any other areas, noting these are predominantly Black and poor areas of the city.

When asked about the state response, Lumumba described the governor’s attitude and approach as a part of a long-held disregard the state’s white elected officials have for both the city’s Black leadership and residents. At one point late last month, the governor made a comment about the state taking over Jackson’s water system.

“What really needs to be done is major infrastructure investment on the federal and state level,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, co-founder and Executive Director of the Mississippi Reproductive Freedom Fund, said last week on MSNBC show “The Reid Out.” She challenged claims that the governor could not reach Mayor Lumumba, as Jackson is the Mississippi state capitol placing the governor in close proximity to city government officials handling a crisis.

“But that’s how little the priority is,” Roberts continued. “And it’s not just Jackson, the Mississippi Delta is without water right now.”

Looking forward, Lumumba said the coalition is thinking about how to operationalize how they do rapid response.

“What we’re trying to do now is think about how we create these rapid response hubs,” she shared. “We know that there are going to be more and more storms and changing weather conditions that shift how we’re currently living. There is no guarantee that we are not going to be able to live the way [we do].”

Brown said climate change is real and needs to be a factor considered in whatever next steps are taken.

“And this will not be the first crisis, but one of many crises,” she said. “Mississippi is one of the poorest states in the nation, but at the end of the day, it’s a group of folks that really love and care genuinely about what happens with our community…we represent, and we stand in love.”

Davis compared the current moment to other times of awakening that brought people into organizing. She said some people had “an aha moment” after the killing of Trayvon Martin or last summer with the killing of George Floyd.

“For some folks in rural Mississippi and Jackson it is going to be the ice storm and water crisis,” said Davis. “I believe [this crisis] will cause people to collectively come together [and] use their power to make some structural changes to what has been happening in the city for decades now.”

As white snow patches become dirty roadside blotches, the South is still feeling the effects of last week's ice storm.

The melting ice hasn't ended the infrastructure problems that were revealed in the frigid temperatures. For so many residents from Jackson, Mississippi, to Shreveport, Louisiana, to West Tennessee, the broken water mains, drinking water shortages, low faucet pressure and fears of flooding may create problems that last much longer than the week-long deep freeze.

Large swaths of the South have boil water advisories because officials are concerned about the levels of bacteria in the drinking water.

Mississippi Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Kelly Richardson said county officials are reaching out for supplies as they assess the damage the storm left behind.

“The biggest request that we’re getting right now is, as you can imagine, water,” she said.

Officials in 10 counties have reported damage to homes and businesses as of Tuesday, but more reports are expected in the coming days. Bailey Martin, press secretary for Gov. Tate Reeves, said Mississippi must hit a threshold of $4.5 million in damages before it can request a federal disaster declaration.

Thousands of customers across the state also remain under boil water advisories as officials try to get their water systems fully operational. Dozens of systems either froze or lost power during the storms, impacting more than 300,000 customers statewide.

In one sign of progress, an advisory in Canton, Mississippi, one of the largest cities in the Jackson area, was lifted late Monday after its system lost pressure Thursday.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams said Monday that crews, now that temperatures are warmer, are attempting to address several water main breaks across the city. Roughly 43,000 customers still have little to no pressure, and Williams said full service across the city may not be restored until Friday.

Thousands of residents in Shreveport and Bossier are without water so the Louisiana House of Representatives voted to send $150,000 worth of bottled water to the area.

Speaker Clay Schexnayder, R-Gonzales, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Stuart Bishop, R-Lafayette, coordinated the House's effort.

“Members around the state were quick to act once we heard water service in Shreveport was an issue,” Schexnayder said. “In a matter of hours, they had water and transportation provided by businesses around the state. It’s been a real team effort.”

In Memphis, the Light, Gas and Water department averaged finding about 10 water main breaks per day since Feb. 15 with a total of 77 main breaks reported. Twenty-five percent of water wells were not operational.

Around Memphis, the Mallory, Sheahan, Allen and Davis water pumping stations were not operational, according to the MLGW report issued Tuesday.

For the past month, thousands of residents of Jackson, Mississippi simply haven’t had water: not safe water, not reliable water. After winter storms knocked out electricity there, as they did throughout the South, the damage also wreaked havoc on Jackson’s brittle water system. Each issue is connected to the other: the aging pipes that need to be replaced, the lead that can seep into the water when the pipes burst, the condition of the water treatment plants. The faucets are back on in Jackson for now, but the pipes aren’t going to hold up much longer. On Tuesday’s episode of What Next, I spoke with Nick Judin, a reporter at the Mississippi Free Press, about how Jackson became a city without water, and how it could happen again, all too soon. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Mary Harris: Last week, the city’s boil-water order was lifted. Do you feel like the crisis is over?

Nick Judin: The underlying problems behind the crisis have not even begun to be solved. Please don’t look away now, because a permanent solution has to be found, and we haven’t even begun that yet.

The crisis is really a chain reaction that gives us a map of the water infrastructure problems that the city has. In the middle of February comes these two severe freezes, the kind the state is completely unused to. Water comes in from a reservoir northeast of the city that then hits these water screens at the water treatment plants. It’s so cold that it can’t get through the screens that freeze.

It’s ice.

It’s ice. Now, what happens then is the basin that is supplying the city’s pipes with water runs low and the pressure in the system drops. People no longer have water. That’s just the beginning of the problem. That’s why no one had water at the beginning. The problem is, once that system loses pressure and everyone loses water, you have miles of pipes in the system that are over 100 years old. So after they freeze, the act of refilling them is absolutely destructive to these pipes. We had more than 100 water main breaks at the final count over the month.

When you went outside, did you see cones everywhere?

You see breaks in the street. You see water running out. You see work crews everywhere, and you don’t see any water coming out of your faucet. It was this process of slowly refilling, slowly pushing the pressure back up and then repairing every main break. That’s why it took a month.

To get to the root of Jackson’s current crisis, you have to go back more than 50 years and talk about how the city itself has changed. Because this water problem can’t be disentangled from larger changes in the state of Mississippi: the desegregation of schools, white flight.

In 1969, the clock finally runs out on the state of Mississippi segregated school system, with Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education. The 1970 school year in Mississippi was like a lightning bolt. You could just see kids being pulled out of school, and the creation of a lot of segregation academies, many of which are still relatively well-regarded schools in Mississippi today. By the time the dust settles in 1980, Jackson never sees population growth ever again. At its height, I think the city had a little bit more than 200,000 people. Today, the best estimate for that is 160,000.

What does that have to do with the water?

You build a water infrastructure for the people you have at the time. What ends up happening is you build that system and then you have white flight, you have capital flight, you have the suburbanization of many of the metropolitan areas around the country. Then that tax base now lives outside the city limits.

And there’s no commuter tax or bridge and tunnel fare.

To my knowledge, there is not nearly enough support coming from the cities and towns around Jackson to support its burden.

You’re saying Jackson built its system to meet this larger population, which to me says, they must have a really robust system with fewer people using it. How did that become a problem for the city?

Advertisement

In 1972, there was a serious amendment to the Clean Water Act that put the burden of responsibility for a lot of wastewater treatment in the municipalities around the United States on the core of these metropolitan areas. A huge, huge amount of this construction was supported with federal grants. By 1987, in our era of austerity and federal pullback, there’s a transition. We stop paying for a lot of these systems with federal money and it devolves to what’s called the state revolving loan funds. Now, you may notice the problem with that. The issue with the loan is that it’s loan. So when you see an end to the federal money that supports a lot of these systems, there’s then a system that’s made for a certain population and that population is no longer there. That becomes a real problem for any city looking to keep its system afloat.

Because you’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need.

You’re having to maintain something that’s much bigger than you need and you no longer have the federal support that made it possible in the first place.

You’ve said Gov. Tate Reeves has been uniquely resistant to addressing the crisis in Mississippi’s waters. Do you think he doesn’t necessarily feel like he needs to fix this problem?

There doesn’t seem to be any direct communication between the governor and the mayor. I’m not really sure how something like that happens if the governor really, really wants to fix the problem.

You spoke to a representative from Jackson who worried that federal involvement actually might not help the state, because it might mean that state legislators feel like they are off the hook and don’t need to step in and help the city.

Well, let me be very clear: Federal involvement will absolutely help the state. I don’t think there’s any situation in which the state gets out of this problem without federal assistance. I don’t think that should be surprising, because, if you want to go and look back at the last time the city really had a working water system, there was immense federal aid coming in to the Public Works Department to make the entire system whole. So when you want to talk about how to get out of this situation, you need improvement at the level of the city, you need investment at the level of the state, and then you need involvement at the federal level. I don’t think any one of those pieces can be missing. I think his concern is not that federal help might not help, but that, with federal engagement, the state will kind of bow out of the whole situation. The state has to address the relationship it has with its capital city. It’s incredibly cheap and easy for representatives and senators who don’t live in the urban areas of the state to complain about Jackson.

Stainless steel pots, a faded-orange wheelbarrow and a 5-gallon container sitting on Barbara Howard’s back porch brim with rainwater. She’s strategically placed them under the roof, letting the light Monday rain gather and then fall into the vessels more effectively.

She grabs a stock pot by its handles and pours it into a nearby trashcan. From there, she’ll scoop out water with a sauce pot to fill her toilet.

A gallon-and-a-half is needed for a single flush. Her Sunday night and Monday collection are enough to last her for the next two days. For Howard, slugging water back and forth from distribution sites is more time-consuming than her newest method.

Inside her South Jackson home, gallons of distilled water and plastic water bottles line her kitchen counters. It’s for teeth-brushing and for handwashing. More for the few dishes she allows herself to use. She doesn’t dare cook, because dirtying dishes means using more water.

“It’s a challenge,” the Jackson State University professor repeats calmly. “But imagine these routines with little bitty ones or the elderly.”

She’s spent nearly two weeks collecting and distributing water. Living without power for four days. Two hotel stays for a cleansing shower. Her faucets ran dry nearly two weeks ago. They still haven’t sputtered back to life. And she isn’t alone.

About 65% of residents in Ward 6 have no water

While water distribution sites lace the city, and restoration has increased since the winter storm glazed Jackson’s infrastructure with ice, South Jackson remains a pocket of residents who are thrusting buckets outside to collect the drizzle. It was only Saturday that some saw a low-pressure stream lurch from their faucets.

About 65% of Ward Six residents have no water, Councilperson Aaron Banks estimated Monday afternoon. It’s not unusual for South Jackson — the location farthest from the treatment plant on the reservoir — to have their water restored last.

Jackson City Councilman Aaron Banks talks about the water distribution efforts at Forest Hill High School in Jackson, Miss., Monday, March 1, 2021. Some residents in the city are still without water due to the February winter storms. (Photo: Eric Shelton/Clarion Ledger)

He knows it firsthand.

As the steady stream of residents pop their trunks open at Forest Hill High School, Banks loads their cars with a 45-pack of water bottles and a gallon of distilled water. He nods toward the two water tankers in the lot, “When we started out here with these tankers, snow was still on the ground.”

Along with a handful of volunteers, Banks has worked through icy temperatures and pelting rain to help South Jackson residents. Monday is no different. Within 20 minutes, a dozen cars pull up.

“I need to pick up for my elderly neighbor,” several people muffle through face masks.

South Jackson is filled with elderly residents and retirees, many of whom have struggled to make it to the water sites and cannot secure gallons of water in their vehicles as they brace the bumpy roads.

Monday afternoon, Rita Johnson was in the line at Forest Hill. She was picking up water for her family and asked for more to deliver to her elderly neighbors.

Johnson’s a mother of three and a nursing student. And, like Howard, she’s been without water for days.

She uses water bottles from the Forest Hill site to cook, and she bounces between friends’ homes for showering. But the water Johnson said she gets from the distribution site isn’t enough. It’s further complicated her already-busy life, but she’s still finding ways to help vulnerable South Jackson residents.

“If this was your parent, you wouldn’t want them to go out,” she said. “We need to try and help each other.”

Brookleigh Neighborhood Association lends a helping hand

There’s no exact timeline for total restoration. No definite date to lift the citywide water boil advisory. But what is clear is the helping hand from the Brookleigh Homeowner and Neighborhood Association for South Jackson residents.

Emon Thompson has lived in Mississippi for the past 30 years, and he’s been the association’s president for almost four. He’s experienced area flooding and water main breaks that have been slow to fix, but he can’t recall a time there wasn’t water to flush a toilet.

Even now, as some Brookleigh resident’s water trickles from the faucet, it can take toilets minutes to refill.

He and his wife Cynthia Thompson, who coordinates the association's social media, noticed South Jackson’s need for support immediately. The neighborhood, about 450 homes dense, is chock-full of retirees and then there's working-class people, many who work jobs stretching before and beyond the hours water distribution sites offer.

The couple has gone door-to-door providing water and worked a distribution site, alongside Banks, Saturday at Griffith Memorial Baptist Church. They've even scooped water from their swimming pool to deliver.

“It could’ve been worse, but it could’ve been better,” Emon Thompson said.

But it isn’t over.

Although water began flowing into some Brookleigh homes, low-pressure causes comes with a host of problems. People can’t get enough water to wash their clothes, safely cook or do stacks of dishes. Monday, Banks urged businesses that rely on substantial amounts of water, such as car washes, to close their doors until water pressure builds back up to normal.

And same for people with running water. Conserve it, Banks said.

Looking forward, he’s narrowing in on mitigation. South Jackson makes up four wards; 4, 5, 6 and 7, and often times, he said, residents feel left behind.

Jackson water crisis: Crews still working to restore pressure, fix water main breaks

“We kind of feel like we’re the stepchild of Jackson, however, that’s not true but it’s the feeling,” Banks said.

The Thompsons, Banks, Johnson and Howard are wading through uncertainties about when water will fully be restored, but for now, they are sure to do two things: Check on neighbors and deliver water to those most vulnerable.

Help doesn’t have to look as large-scale as the Thompsons fielding resident calls and going door-to-door, or tanker trucks cruising through a neighborhood. It can be systematic, like Howards rainwater collection. Or grabbing an extra case of water bottles for a neighbor, like Johnson.

“I appreciate the tanks. I appreciate the bottled water. But I rather have the pipes fixed,” Howard said. “It’s one thing to put a Band-Aid on the problem and it’s one thing to fix it. A 14-day Band-Aid is long enough.”

84,"Mar 24, 2021",Mississippi Today,Why Jackson’s water system is broken,"Janna Avalon, a 72-year-old retired newspaper editor, lived out the mid-February ice storm and weeks-long water outage just feet from South Jackson’s empty water tower.

The one million-gallon tank, one of several across the city, is meant to store water at a high elevation, utilizing gravity to pressurize the delivery system, especially during service interruptions.

But contingency plans are a myth in a system as chronically broken as Jackson’s.

So for the better part of the last month, Avalon and her husband Billy heaved buckets of water they retrieved from government tankers, kind neighbors or rainfall into their home to flush their toilet or wash dishes.

Most Jacksonians lost running water altogether after back-to-back winter storms the week of Feb. 14 stunned unprepared utilities across the Deep South, and the Avalons were some of the roughly 43,000 people whose taps remained dry for more than two weeks. City officials were still telling most residents, 82% of whom are Black, to boil their water a month later.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government … when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered, it’s a profound betrayal of trust.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

In the Avalons’ spacious backyard — beyond a wooden playset, garden and plum trees, plastic flamingos and decorative stone statues — the water tower adds its own charm. Avalon said it reflects colors in the evening sky, prolonging sunsets.

“It’s got all these great little attributes,” Avalon said, “except water.”

Avalon grew up in Jackson and has lived in her home, where she raised her five children, for 28 years. Despite ongoing utility hiccups, she’s intent on staying. She asks why she should have to move — and contribute to the city’s population decline of 20% since 1980 — to access basic human services. Why city and state government officials can’t or won’t improve conditions where she already lives. Why her water bills are unreliable, why nobody reads her water meter, and why there is a “huge city water tower in our backyard and there’s no water in it.”

The questions seem simple, but the answers are complex, and the dysfunction is causing a rift between Jacksonians and their leaders.

“Water is the most intimate relationship you have with the government,” said Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies. “It comes into your house. You take it into your body. We put our children in it, and we prepare food with it. And when that fails — when the water is of poor quality or, in your case, just not delivered — it’s a profound betrayal of trust. And it shakes you to your core.”

Many Jacksonians lacked access to clean drinking water long before the most recent storm. In fact, on a good day, officials advise pregnant people and children under five not to drink from the tap, a phenomenon that’s been the case for the last five years.

“And most people in Jackson don’t even know,” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund, told Mississippi Today during the recent outage. “The city and the state have done nothing to provide water to those populations. This whole time they should have been providing water for pregnant people and children under five. This whole time.”

And yet, when Jackson water customers do receive a bill (because consistent and accurate billing has also been a problem), they’re sometimes paying exorbitant amounts for water that’s unsafe to drink.

Every city water bill notifies customers of the hazard of high lead levels first found in Jackson’s tap water in 2016, caused by recurring faulty water treatment techniques that remain unaddressed.

Only a year ago, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency issued an emergency order stating that the city’s water system presented “imminent and substantial endangerment” to its customers and could contain E. Coli.

Water outages and the presence of harmful contaminants when the water does reach the tap are two different scenarios with unique sets of threats, but they both stem from decades of underinvestment and deferred maintenance within a dysfunctional and outdated water treatment and delivery system.

And the risks of scarce or dirty water exist more often in the homes of families who are already burdened by the ongoing pandemic, low wages, stagnant wealth, a lack of quality health care and racism.

The city is faced with two colliding but distinct funding problems: One, the city’s infrastructure is only getting older and past administrations did not plan for inevitable future capital investments, as is true in many aging cities. Two, the loss of customer base and pervasive billing troubles have left the water department without a feasible revenue model for regular operations and maintenance.

“This is like a triple or quadruple whammy, what’s going on,” said Alan Mallach, senior fellow at D.C.-based Center for Community Progress. “One layer is the fact that older cities — completely leaving aside race, poverty, all that — are at a disadvantage to young cities.”

“Then you get the second layer,” Mallach continued. “You have this whole phenomenon which has been going on really since the 1950s, where older cities, central cities, have essentially been abandoned by large parts of the middle class, especially the white middle class, for the suburbs.”

Winter storms in past years — 1989, 1994, 2010, 2014 and most recently 2018 — have tested the city’s outdated water delivery system and caused widespread water main breaks and outages. Each time, the city has scrambled to make band-aid repairs, only to wait until the next catastrophe. Jackson isn’t alone in taking this approach, said Teodoro, the Wisconsin professor.

“The nature of local politics is that city governments will tend to neglect utilities until they break because they’re literally buried,” he said. “One of the things that is a perennial challenge for governments that operate water systems is that the quality of the water system is very hard for people to observe. But the price is very easy for them to observe.”

Not even EPA orders — including a decade-old consent decree over the city’s wastewater system that continues to release raw sewage into the Pearl River — have resulted in much meaningful action. City water and sewer systems are not like corporations, Teodoro said; the authorities can’t just take their license away. And imposing large fines only punishes the taxpayers they are supposed to be protecting. “In the end, there’s very little you can do,” Teodoro said of regulators.

“They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.” Laurie Bertram Roberts, a longtime reproductive rights activist in Jackson and director of Alabama-based Yellowhammer Fund

This year, Jackson officials said, issues were particularly pronounced at the water treatment plants, which are not enclosed and protected from the elements like plants typically are up north.

Jackson Public Works Director Charles Williams told the media that the screens through which water from the reservoir is filtered had frozen, rendering the plant incapable of taking in water, causing pressure to drop across the system. Operators didn’t discover the issue until the weekend after the storms. They also encountered malfunctioning raw water pumps.

Also, the 10 million gallon basins where filtered reservoir water is stored before it is chemically treated contained two feet of sludge due to an overdose in chemicals that occured over time when water wasn’t coming in — a possible human error, Williams said. The city took two basins offline to clean them the week after the storm and cleaned the third a couple weeks later.

In addition to needed equipment upgrades, the city is sorely lacking the personnel needed to operate the plant in its current condition. City officials rely on these operators to notify them of an event, such as sludge build up, that they need to address. Jackson employs three high-level operators at each of its water treatment plants, when each facility really needs six of these top officials, Williams told Mississippi Today. In 2018, there were 60 unfilled positions in Public Works, Clarion Ledger reported.

“You have to maintain what you have until you’re able to make improvements,” Williams said. “But once again, you have to have funding.”

Two generations of white and wealth flight out of Jackson has reduced the built-in revenue that officials say the water system needs just to maintain full operations, including hiring personnel — let alone to make a dent in an estimated $1 billion worth of needed upgrades.

The city’s bungled attempt to revamp its water meter and billing system through a $90 million contract with German-based manufacturer Siemens only worsened the water department’s cash flow — not to mention public confidence — while any outside investment in the capital city has come at a crawl.

“And we all know why,” Roberts, the activist, said. “Nobody wants to invest in Jackson because of who runs Jackson and who lives in Jackson. Because white folks don’t dominate here anymore. They just want to keep on letting stuff break until we break and go away. That’s what it feels like.”

With a population that’s 82% African American, Jackson is the single Blackest large city in the nation. Roughly 1-in-4 residents live in poverty, and in some west and south Jackson communities, the hardest hit by water outages, the average household pulls an income of $25,000 and as low as $15,000 in some pockets.

The capital city has lost roughly 40,000 residents since the population peaked at about 200,000 in 1980, after an initial wave of white residents left to avoid putting their children in integrated schools. Half of the decline occurred in the last two decades as more middle-class Black families moved, and the city’s white population continued to drop from 52% in 1980 to 28% in 2000 to 17% in 2019, according to U.S. Census data.

As the customer base declines, the system might clean and pump out less water, but the same infrastructure remains under the surface of Jackson’s 111 square miles, an area geographically larger than Seattle, Baltimore or Cincinnati. Parts of Jackson’s 1,500 miles of water mains are over 100 years old.

Of course, pipes under streets in front of abandoned properties — about 4,000 by one 2019 count — still require maintenance.

At the same time, family resources are diminishing with inflation. Household buying power fell just slightly in the 1980s and was relatively stable through the 1990s. But since 2000, the annual median household income in Jackson has dropped about $6,500 in inflation-adjusted dollars, a roughly 15% decrease, according to a Mississippi Today analysis of Census data.

“We are a city with very high levels of poverty, and it’s difficult for us to raise the rates enough to do large scale replacement type projects and not make it unaffordable to live in the city of Jackson,” said former city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

Yet the cost of Jackson’s poor quality water is still passed on to families who don’t trust the tap and purchase bottled water — which can cost a family of four $50-$100 a month — to drink instead.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.” Manuel Teodoro, an associate professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison’s La Follette School of Public Affairs and Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies

The city raised water rates in 2013, but the Siemens deal penned the same year came with an onslaught of problems, including the installation of faulty water meters and meters that measured water in gallons instead of the correct cubic feet. This made any benefits of the rate increase virtually impossible to see.

The results have been nonsensical. Over the past several years, the city has mailed exorbitant bills to some customers and none to others. Sometimes, the charges weren’t based on how much water a household used and other times, city officials advised residents to “pay what they think they owe.” Past officials said the city lacked the manpower and expertise in the billing department to manually rectify the account issues with any speed.

In trying to protect people during the persistent billing blunders, the city has at times instituted no-shutoff policies, which demonstrate compassion but haven’t helped to compel payment.

Today, more than 8,000 customers, or nearly one-sixth of the city’s customer base, still aren’t receiving bills. Nearly 16,000 customers owe more than $100 or are more than 90 days past due, a city spokesperson told Mississippi Today. Jackson water customers owe a total of $90.3 million.

As a result, the city continues to miss out on tens of millions of water revenues. In 2016, when officials first uncovered the issue, the city’s actual water sewer collections during the previous year was a startling 32% less than projected — a roughly $26 million shortfall.

It’s a vicious cycle: revenue shortfalls make it harder for the city to purchase upgrades or hire the personnel needed to properly manage the billing system; the billing inaccuracies and sloppy accounting encourage a culture of nonpayment; the unpaid bills just further tank the revenue.

Frustration only grows as residents are expected to pay for subpar service within a utility that’s already largely taken for granted.

The city received just under $60 million out of last year’s $90 million Siemens settlement, about $33 million of which is restricted in reserves or bond covenants. Another $12.6 million went to repay the general fund, leaving about $14 million for emergency sewer repairs and a new billing system.

Lawyers got the rest — a little more than $30 million.

The story of Jackson’s failing infrastructure, national experts say, could just as easily describe the scenario in other major cities like Detroit, Toledo or Kansas City, whose leaders have had to look outside their own budgets to solve major crises.

A city rests within a state, after all, and decisions made at the state level and the impact those decisions have on the economy and public services affect what a city is able to accomplish.

“It’s really disingenuous to look at the politics and policies of any one American city in isolation from the state context in which it exists,” Teodoro said.

The residents who left Jackson in the late 20th century fled to surrounding suburbs such as Rankin County, the wealthier Republican bastion that produced many of Mississippi’s most powerful politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves.

Less than a year ago, Reeves vetoed bipartisan legislation that would have provided relief to poor Jacksonians with past due water bills and propped up the city’s bond rating, a proposal he suggested perpetuated a “‘free money’ concept,” Clarion Ledger reported.

A similar bill, which would apply to all municipalities, is making its way through the Legislature this session. Lawmakers also killed a bill to assist Jackson with infrastructure bonds, but it still has a chance to pass legislation that would allow the city to propose its own sales tax increase to pay for water system improvements.

Meanwhile, Speaker Philip Gunn, another top lawmaker who lives in a Jackson suburb, spent the session trying to pass tax reform that would have actually increased the tax burden on the bottom 60% of the state’s income earners, according to one study, while significantly cutting the taxes of the richest residents.

The city is also still fighting the state’s 2016 attempt to wrest control of Jackson’s airport. Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said during a recent mayoral debate that during a conversation with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, the state Senate leader who lives in the white pocket of northeast Jackson, the lieutenant governor asked the mayor to “give me my airport” in exchange for infrastructure funding.

This ongoing tension is the backdrop for the city’s current crisis.

Academics who have studied government water systems recommend they regionalize in order to spread costs among struggling cities and more affluent suburbs. There’s just one recurring hitch to securing such an agreement: “Racism makes all of this so much harder,” Teodoro said.

“These would be hard problems, but we could solve them if it wasn’t for racism.”

The history of racial conflict, Teodoro explained, creates a scenario where Black residents of the city fear losing control of their services to the same people who have systematically oppressed them. And white residents of the suburbs, who chalk the city’s problems up to incompetence, don’t feel responsible to help.

In the Jackson metro, not only is regionalization a tough sell, there are examples of the opposite happening. West Rankin Utility Authority recently splintered off to build its own wastewater treatment facility to become independent from Jackson’s Savannah Street Wastewater Treatment Plant.

It’s twofold: Systemic racism is an unmistakable underlying cause for Jackson’s stripped resources, and while it may be clouded by a mutual distrust today, racism continues to prevent future investment.

For Avalon, a white woman, understanding the decline of her majority-Black community is as easy as pointing to the state’s refusal to fully fund education or expand Medicaid.

“Racism is everywhere,” Avalon said. “We need to recognize what we’re talking about. If my kid goes to public school that’s not up to par, why? We’re all paying taxes.”

The storage tank on Avalon’s street wasn’t full of water, Williams explained, because as the system loses pressure on an ongoing basis, not just during storms, the tower is constantly drained to make up for the deficiencies. He said he didn’t know if that tank had ever been full.

South Jackson often bears the brunt of water crises because the area is one of the furthest away from the treatment plant, so water takes longer to travel there. What little water would have been inside the tower at the time of the storm was used up immediately by some of the roughly 70,000 people who live in South Jackson.

That’s a convenient explanation for Avalon, who says her community is always last to receive attention on a variety of issues. “We’ve been putting up with that stuff all my life in south Jackson,” she said.

Jackson City Councilman De’Keither Stamps pushed the council to ask the state for $60 million, in addition to an initial $47 million proposal, to build new water storage towers in South Jackson and Byram to build up capacity in those areas.

“You shouldn’t have to live your life in fear of the plant going down,” Stamps said. “You should have enough capacity within a short distance from your house to maintain yourself.”

On March 1, just as water was starting to trickle out of her tap, Avalon stood on her back porch as it rained and looked out at the empty water reservoir that engulfs the skyline. City contractors had just come out a few years ago to repaint its dingy exterior, she recalled. Some 100 feet up, a large black fowl crouched on top of the massive steel structure stamped with the City of Jackson seal.

“If they’re vultures, gosh, that’s a terrible omen,” she said with a chuckle.

Water pressure in the Avalon home fell again in the following days as city officials discovered the facility’s intake filters were clogged with clams, mussels, tree branches and other items and had to take the systems offline. The Avalons had to shut off their water again the following weekend because of a broken pipe on their property. They’ll expect outages to continue.

“It keeps coming back and slapping us in the face, and we can’t do anything about it,” Avalon said.

Jackson is getting millions of dollars from the state to help fix its water system. After a lot of debate, the Mississippi Legislature approved $3 million, much less than the $47 million the mayor wanted.February’s water crisis crippled one of Jackson’s water treatment plants and left much of the city without running water for a month. After that unprecedented infrastructure failure, Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba sent a letter to state and federal leaders asking for $47 million to pay for overdue repairs. The Republican-controlled legislature approved only $3 million to pay for repairs to the Fewell Water Plant at the Waterworks curve on I-55.“The $3 million that we received (Thursday) is nowhere near what we want, but it’s a start. Three-million-dollars is better than $0,” said State Rep. Chris Bell, a Democrat from Jackson.None of that money can be spent on the O.B. Curtis plant, which was a source of the initial water system shut down.“They came with a lot of rounded numbers, like, ‘We need $1 million. We need $2 million.’ So, we gave them $3 million to fix up the water plant, or at least get started on that,” said Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann.The legislature also approved a bill to help Jackson fix water billing problems. Sometimes customers go months without getting a water bill, and when they do, they may be charged thousands of dollars.“To allow the city to resolve all those disputed and delinquent claims, that’s going to clean up the books,” said Sen. David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson.Blount said he’s hopeful Gov. Tate Reeves will sign the bill. The governor vetoed similar legislation last year.“At the very beginning of these negotiations, I sat down with the governor’s staff person and we went to this bill again and again, line by line, because our intention was to help Jackson and get him a bill that he can agree to,” Blount said.“I’m confident this bill is going to give us some bonding capacity, so we will be able to make sure that our water treatment plants and other things are taken care of,” Bell said.Both bills approved by the legislature will have to be signed by the governor.Jackson is expected to receive $44 million under the new federal American Rescue Plan and they could get more federal dollars through the state to upgrade infrastructure, according to state leaders.","BUT THE REPUBLICAN CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE APPROVED ONLY $3 MILLION TO PAY FOR REPAIRS TO THE FEWELL WATER PLANT AT THE WATERWORKS CURVE ON I-55.

Former NFL wide receiver Vincent Jackson was found dead Monday at a Florida hotel room, days after authorities spoke with him as part of a welfare check, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office.

A housekeeper discovered the 38-year-old’s body at around 11:30 a.m. Monday, an official said.

There were no signs of trauma and the medical examiner’s office was looking into a cause of death at the Homewood Suites in Brandon, near Tampa.

Sheriff’s officials said his family initially reported Jackson missing on Wednesday. Deputies tracked him down to the hotel two days later, spoke with him and canceled the missing person’s case.

Sheriff Chad Chronister said his department has opened an investigation.

“My heart aches for the many loved ones Vincent Jackson leaves behind, from his wife and children to the Buccaneers nation that adored him,” Chronister said in a statement posted on social media.

“Mr. Jackson was a devoted man who put his family and community above everything else,” the sheriff said, noting that Jackson was made an honorary deputy.

Jackson played for the Chargers for seven seasons before becoming a free agent because of a contract dispute. He then went on to play five seasons with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before retiring in 2018.

His fans expressed their shock and grief across social media.

“We are all mourning the loss of our beloved VincentTJackson. His wife and family ask that everyone respect their privacy at this time,” tweeted the Jackson In Action 83 Foundation, a nonprofit that Jackson founded to support military families.

More clean water and supplies will be coming to the Jackson area Wednesday to help those who were affected by the winter storms that swept through Mississippi in mid-February.

Members of the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church, based in Stonecrest, Georgia, will give out bottled water, household cleaning supplies and non-perishable food at the Pearl Street African Methodist Episcopal Church, located at 2615 Robinson St. in Jackson, beginning at 4 p.m.

The church has previously helped other areas of the country during disasters such as the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and the New Orleans area following Hurricane Katrina.

They had recently been providing supplies to people in Texas who were also affected by the winter storms, but were later contacted by Jackson residents to ask for help.

""Jackson wasn't even on our radar,"" said Jamal Bryant, senior pastor of the church. ""We had no idea this was happening.""

Bryant said he reached out to former Jackson mayor Tony Yarber to learn more about what was happening in the city and began collecting donations soon after.

""It was dizzying to me how this wasn't a bigger news story,"" Bryant said.

Bryant said he hasn't heard of an event like this happening so close to home before, but is glad his church can offer help to those still in need nearly three weeks later.

91,1 month ago,Mississippi Today,"Policy experts explore Jackson water solutions, highlight void in federal aid","The fragility of Jackson’s water system, plagued by decades of outmigration, deferred maintenance and declining federal support, was on full national display in February after a historic freeze left at least 40,000 without running water for weeks.

City officials are asking for state and federal support to help raise the $1 billion they say is needed to fix the system, which failed to produce safe drinking water for more than a month after the storm.

Mississippi Today spoke with several national policy experts about how other American cities have navigated large-scale water funding shortages and how Jackson could move forward. The experts offered several solutions, chronicled in the article below, but ultimately agreed that the absence of a more involved federal government leaves few answers for Jackson.

“A lot of these systems that are on the brink of falling apart, they’re just one extreme event away from a crisis,” said Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University. “That’s what happened in Jackson. It’s a cumulative effect of not investing in our infrastructure for so many years. Aging infrastructure, all of these extreme events that we’re experiencing, it’s all coming together.”

Some signs of short-term relief have trickled in during the past couple weeks. Jackson is set to receive $47 million from the American Rescue Plan, the name of the new $1.9 trillion stimulus bill President Joe Biden signed last week. Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith introduced a bill in Congress that would steer infrastructure funds towards the city.

But those measures still leave Jackson a long way from the necessary funding to repair and revamp its water system.

Federal water infrastructure support has plummeted since the 1970s, when the U.S. sent funds to cities to help comply with the newly-passed Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts. In 1977, federal support accounted for 31% of governments’ total water utility spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office. By 2017, that share had dropped to 4%.

Now, such spending largely comes in the form of loans rather than grants, mainly through the Environmental Protection Agency’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act that supports specific projects, as well as an annual allotment called the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which last year totaled $2.7 billion for the whole country.

“If Jackson alone has a $1 billion need, and the total EPA State Revolving Fund is $2.7 billion, that starts to give you an order of magnitude of how big the problem is versus how much money is actually available,” said Dr. Martin Doyle, Director for Water Policy at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University.

As for many cities with rupturing infrastructure, the decline in federal support has coincided with Jackson’s sharp decline in population, which has shrunk by 20% since 1980.

Ajami, Doyle, and others discussed with Mississippi Today the ways other cities have tried to boost water infrastructure funding, such as consolidation and privatization, as well as different approaches to water billing.

Consolidation of regional water systems

For many cities, capital improvements such as upgrades to treatment plants and large-scale pipe replacements are simply unaffordable for their tax bases. Those cities instead focus what money is available towards regular operations and maintenance. But as bigger projects get pushed back, their costs only grow.

Dr. Newsha Ajami, director of the Urban Water Policy program at Stanford University

“The cost of recovering from the crisis is much higher than the cost of prevention,” Ajami said.

One successful cost-saving solution is consolidating utilities with neighboring towns and cities, similar to the way school districts merge to save money.

In 2014, after the city of Detroit filed for bankruptcy, a court ordered the creation of a regional authority that assumed the city’s water and sewer services. The Great Lake Water Authority took on $4 billion in debt from the city, and Detroit officials said the change allowed it to make infrastructure upgrades it couldn’t otherwise afford. Similarly, Raleigh, N.C., saw a decrease in maintenance and operation costs after combining utilities with nearby municipalities in the early 2000s.

“That starts to increase the scale of the operation, which means that you’re able to gain some efficiencies,” Doyle said.

In the U.S., there are more than 50,000 water utilities that operate independently, meaning they each have their own management and set of personnel, from engineers to customer service. When places combine utilities, they’re often able to serve the same populations at a lower fixed cost.

Despite the cost-saving potential, some city officials are unsure if Jackson and its neighbors could come to such an agreement, especially considering political and racial differences.

“I think it would be a difficult political thing to put a regional water system together, just because there’s a lack of trust issue,” said Jackson city councilman Ashby Foote. “A lot of the surrounding communities, I don’t think they would let Jackson run it, and I don’t think the city would vote to relinquish control of the systems.”

Foote and Jackson councilman De’Keither Stamps cited disagreements such as control over Jackson’s airport and the recent decision by West Rankin County officials to break off and build its own wastewater facility.

“Now (West Rankin) has to spend all this money to build a new sewer plant because of relationships and politics,” Stamps said. “How does that benefit the end user?”

Privatization of Jackson’s water system

While not as popular, privatization is a similar solution to consolidation, explained Doyle, who explored water-funding solutions for shrinking cities in an article for the American Water Works Association journal. Private water utilities, which serve 15% of Americans, can combine functions just as a regional utility would and can also provide more resources and expertise. Research also shows they are less likely to violate the EPA’s health-related drinking water statutes than public utilities.

The main concern around private utilities is cost. If a company took over Jackson’s water system, it would have to justify any rate increases with the state’s Public Service Commission; however, Doyle’s paper cites that “it is not uncommon for water rates to increase by greater than 10% when public systems are privatized, and in some cases, rates have reportedly almost doubled.”

Doyle said while it’s unclear how much more a private utility would cost Jackson, it should be considered a “tool in the toolkit.” Ajami and others were more skeptical.

“I don’t think privatization is going to solve the water problem for Jackson,” Ajami argued. “It’s probably going to make water more unaffordable. Their system will be upgraded, I’m just not sure that will lead to more affordable water rates for Jackson.”

Former Mayor Harvey Johnson Jr. said he turned down the idea while in office.

“That idea was thrown out, I rejected it,” said Johnson, who was mayor from 1997 to 2005 and again from 2009 and 2013. He asserted that private companies don’t have the same accountability as elected officials, and that cities can get locked into long-term contracts without a way out. “The driving force there is the bottom line, it’s not service.”

Jackson City Council President Aaron Banks said that whether it’s consolidation or privatization, Jackson leadership needs to be open-minded.

“I think we have to explore all those options,” Banks said.

Balancing affordability and water revenue

Despite the city’s long list of needed system improvements, officials know that raising water rates could make the service unaffordable in a place where 1-in-4 residents live below the poverty line.

Even if Jackson leaders had the political will to raise customers’ rates, paying for a $1 billion municipal bond would add $55 to $60 a month in charges to every household, or about a full day’s work on minimum wage, according to associate professor Manuel Teodoro of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies.

In 2017, Philadelphia took an innovative approach to address affordability: its Tiered Assistance Program, the first of its kind in the country, allows low-income residents to make payments based on earnings rather than water usage, and it also provides a path for debt forgiveness. Like in Jackson, many Philadelphia residents had built up water debt and weren’t contributing to the city’s water revenue. Since TAP began, the city simultaneously reduced water bill debt and increased the number of customers paying for the service.

Henrietta Locklear, vice president at financial consultant firm Raftelis, worked on Philadelphia’s assistance program and told Mississippi Today that such a system could work in Jackson should the city decide to increase water rates.

“The role is really more to say, ‘We have to have rate increases, and we know it’s going to affect some of our customers detrimentally, and we’re offering assistance to help customers in need,’” Locklear said.

Adjusting the water billing formula

Another way to stabilize revenue could be to adjust the city’s billing formula. Ajami, the Stanford policy expert, explained that while Jackson’s first priority is addressing emergency repairs to its system, the city should also aim to maximize its future water funding.

Jackson, like many cities, charges residents based on both water usage and tiered pricing, which adds a fee after a certain threshold. Customers are charged $3.21 per hundred cubic feet, and then a $7 flat fee is added after 300 cubic feet, or a little over 2,000 gallons, according to a city spokesperson.

Cities rely heavily on volumetric, or use-based, pricing because the more water a utility treats and delivers, the more strain it puts on the system. Yet volumetric pricing can leave a utility with varying revenue returns, Ajami said.

“If you use a gallon or 10 gallons, I still need to operate the treatment plant, I still need to maintain the pipes, I still need to operate the pumps,” Ajami said. “If people use less (water), they’re paying less, and then I have less money to do all those things.”

She said that Jackson would benefit from some combination of its current system and a “decoupled” rate — a common format for energy bills — which includes a fixed rate that pays for the utility’s routine operating costs.

Doyle added that the varying, volumetric nature of water bills stands out from other government revenue streams.

“A lot of the services we get are not use-based,” he said. Many roads, for instance, are mostly paid for by property taxes, not by how much a person drives. “Same thing for jails, same thing for city governments, same thing for school systems.”

In light of affordability issues, Doyle and Ajami both wondered why the U.S. has no federal safety net for water bills.

“You can get money from the federal government to assist you in being able to pay for household food and energy,” Doyle said. “You can’t get that for water, and that’s kind of weird.”

Ajami agreed, pointing to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program that helps pay for energy bills, and the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program that helps with phone bills.

“In a way you’re all subsidizing access to communication, which is important,” she said, “but if we have something like that, why can’t we have something similar for water?”

A “barometer” of segregation

Jackson leaders in the past few weeks have asked state and federal officials to provide the city with money to begin repairing its water and sewer system.

Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba met with newly-appointed EPA Administrator Michael Regan to discuss funding avenues, and U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson pledged to support any request for federal help.

Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann told Mississippi Today that state legislators “want to help.” Yet Hosemann, as well as Gov. Tate Reeves and Sen. Hyde-Smith, have criticized the city’s management of its past funding without mentioning other systemic causes that led to the crisis.

Mississippi Today reported on Wednesday that legislative leaders killed the city’s main ask to improve its water system: allow the Jackson City Council’s proposal to increase the city’s sales tax by 1 cent to be placed on to a citywide ballot.

“If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.” Harvey Johnson Jr., former Jackson mayor

Activists and academics who spoke with Mississippi Today described the way racism has fueled the inability of the 82% Black-city to address infrastructure needs, from white flight to a lack of state support.

Yet even with more state-led enthusiasm, Mississippi alone can’t afford Jackson’s funding needs, said former Jackson city councilman Melvin Priester Jr.

“While we always talk about, ‘We want more help from the state,’ the state doesn’t really have a big pool of money available to flow down to municipalities for this,” Priester said.

Priester and Johnson, Jackson’s former mayor, emphasized that the federal government’s deflated water funding has only inflated the city’s need. For instance, Jackson is struggling to fight its way out of an EPA consent decree for violations under the Clean Water Act, and last year received a $500,000 fine for violations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.

“There’s no resources coming from the federal government to help local governments to meet those standards,” Johnson said. “If you talk to a city councillor in Memphis, in New Orleans, in Birmingham, in Newark, they’ll tell you the same thing: the federal government has deserted local governments when it comes to infrastructure improvement, and we’re witnessing that now.”

Ajami agrees that political willingness is part of the issue, adding that the disconnect between Americans and how they receive water may be why there’s a lack of political pressure.

“Because it’s easy to access water for a majority of Americans, people don’t think about the complexity of the system that brings water to us,” she said. “You drive on the road, so if there are potholes, you experience them. You don’t see water pipes. It’s a hidden infrastructure that we don’t value as much, while it’s the most essential resource we depend on in our daily life.”

Ajami also underscored the impacts of funding shortages on a city’s poorer and disadvantaged citizens: they can’t afford to rely on bottled water or a filtration system, and they’re left with an aging infrastructure that their local government can’t afford to fix.

“We’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities.” Dr. Martin Doyle

Cities have fallen into a cycle where the inability to afford repairs compounds the effects of the broken system, which is largely what created the desperation Jackson felt this past month. That’s why, Doyle explained, water utilities have become a good indicator of disparities across the country.

“Paying for water in a rich city is, on a per population basis, very cheap,” he said. “Paying for water in a poorer city on a per population basis is really expensive. So we’re getting this segregation not just between households and not just between neighborhoods, we’re getting this segregation between cities. That’s why I think one of the best barometers of how that big sorting in America is actually taking place is in the water utilities.”

But those measures still leave Jackson a long way from the necessary funding to repair and revamp its water system.
Federal water infrastructure support has plummeted since the 1970s, when the U.S. sent funds to cities to help comply with the newly-passed Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water Acts.
In 1977, federal support accounted for 31% of governments’ total water utility spending, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

92,"Mar 11, 2021",Bustle,How To Help Those Affected By The Water Crisis In Mississippi,"A few weeks ago, the dangerous winter weather conditions that hit the southern U.S. made headlines across the country, with much of the attention placed on Texas. But those in neighboring areas were just as impacted by the extreme winter storm. Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst. Weeks later and many residents are still without any drinking or flushing water.

The city — and roughly 5,000 of its residents, the majority of which are low-income Black families — is experiencing a water crisis. Cassandra Welchlin, the state organizer for the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable, a network that pushes for equitable public policy for Black women and girls, tells Bustle that many people in Jackson are unable to afford food because they can’t get to work. Others are forced to stay home from their jobs because they can’t perform simple everyday tasks like taking a shower or brushing their teeth.

Weeks after the winter storm, Jackson, Mississippi is experiencing a water crisis.

She puts the blame on the state’s weak infrastructure. “This has been a long-standing problem,” says Welchlin. Politicians don’t always put resources where they need to be, she explains, which is why organizations like hers join together to provide support for the community. Through donations, the Mississippi Black Women’s Roundtable has organized water drives, provided gift cards for hotel stays and groceries, and provided outreach to find water to use from neighboring towns. “We’ve worked with a legislature from the Mississippi Gulf Coast to get truckloads of water brought into the city,” Welchlin says. She was then able to partner with local schools and community leaders to distribute the water to those in need.

Welchlin is now mobilizing community members to help those hardest hit groups like the elderly and single moms, and is urging residents who have cars to take water to the homes of the elderly so they can simply flush their toilets. She’s also been collecting donations like diapers and baby food to help single mothers who abruptly lost work and didn’t qualify for paid leave.

More than anything, Welchlin says residents and the organizations helping to restore these families are still in need of donations because people are still without water and struggling to get essential household and personal items. If you’re looking to help, you can donate to these local organizations that support families across Mississippi:","Take Jackson, Mississippi, where the city’s water supply froze and burst.

96,1 month ago,WJTV,US West prepares for possible 1st water shortage declaration,"CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) — The man-made lakes that store water supplying millions of people in the U.S. West and Mexico are projected to shrink to historic lows in the coming months, dropping to levels that could trigger the federal government’s first-ever official shortage declaration and prompt cuts in Arizona and Nevada.

The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released 24-month projections this week forecasting that less Colorado River water will cascade down from the Rocky Mountains through Lake Powell and Lake Mead and into the arid deserts of the U.S. Southwest and the Gulf of California. Water levels in the two lakes are expected to plummet low enough for the agency to declare an official shortage for the first time, threatening the supply of Colorado River water that growing cities and farms rely on.

It comes as climate change means less snowpack flows into the river and its tributaries, and hotter temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the drought-plagued American West.

The agency’s models project Lake Mead will fall below 1,075 feet (328 meters) for the first time in June 2021. That’s the level that prompts a shortage declaration under agreements negotiated by seven states that rely on Colorado River water: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.

The April projections, however, will not have binding impact. Federal officials regularly issue long-term projections but use those released each August to make decisions about how to allocate river water. If projections don’t improve by then, the Bureau of Reclamation will declare a Level 1 shortage condition. The cuts would be implemented in January.

Arizona, Nevada and Mexico have voluntarily given up water under a drought contingency plan for the river signed in 2019. A shortage declaration would subject the two U.S. states to their first mandatory reductions. Both rely on the Colorado River more than any other water source, and Arizona stands to lose roughly one-third of its supply.

Water agency officials say they’re confident their preparation measures, including conservation and seeking out alternative sources, would allow them to withstand cuts if the drought lingers as expected.

“The study, while significant, is not a surprise. It reflects the impacts of the dry and warm conditions across the Colorado River Basin this year, as well as the effects of a prolonged drought that has impacted the Colorado River water supply,” officials from the Arizona Department of Water Resources and Central Arizona Project said in a joint statement.","Water levels in the two lakes are expected to plummet low enough for the agency to declare an official shortage for the first time, threatening the supply of Colorado River water that growing cities and farms rely on.

As residents for decades, the recent city water crisis was nothing new. Mississippi Clarion Ledger

Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba is walking back statements he made alleging state-owned properties in Jackson were not paying for water.

Lumumba made the comments to the New York Times and in at least one press conference locally amid the city's water crisis in an apparent effort to show the city doesn't receive its fair share of revenue from the state.

Lumumba said he sent a retraction to the Times after an unnamed official in his administration pointed out the error. The correction came about a week after the March 12 article was published, according to the Times.

Buy Photo Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba gives an update on the city's water situation during the weekly press conference at city hall in Jackson, Miss., Monday, Feb. 22, 2021. (Photo: Barbara Gauntt/Clarion Ledger)

Lumumba first told the paper the city “provides water for the state of Mississippi, but we don’t get paid for the water we provide to them. If we simply charged the state like any other customer, we’d be in a lot better position.”

When asked to clarify on Monday, the mayor's office released a statement.

“It has come to my attention that I have misspoken with regard to the state of Mississippi paying for water within the city of Jackson,” Lumumba said. “The state does in fact pay for its water. I stand corrected.”

Water billing plan: Plan to overhaul Jackson's water billing system two months away, consultant says

The correction comes after reports surfaced that showed state-owned properties were indeed paying their water bills and have been for years.

Jackson Jambalaya first broke the news and revealed through public record requests that several properties — including the Capitol Complex, Department of Agriculture & Commerce, PERS, and the Health Department — have paid several hundred thousand dollars in water bills in just this fiscal year alone.

The comments have generated their own controversy between the mayor and Gov. Tate Reeves. When asked Monday, Reeves blasted the mayor for the claims.

""Either that was a complete lie or he was informed wrong about what the state pays,"" Reeves said. ""My understanding is the state has spent well in excess of half a million dollars on water alone.""

Reeves also pointed to the city's issues with its water billing system, where thousands of water customers still do not receive a bill. That has resulted in a shortfall of millions of dollars of revenue every year for the city.

The Clarion Ledger has also submitted public records requests for billing information from state-owned properties. It is also examining whether those properties pay property taxes. Lumumba — in his correction — said the state does not pay taxes nor a payment in lieu of taxes. It also does not pay for police and fire services, he said.

The correction comes as Lumumba and other city officials are attempting to secure $47 million in funding from the state to help repair its deficient infrastructure. Consecutive days of freezing temperatures led to a historic shutdown of the water's treatment plants, leading to widespread water shortages and outages, and resulting in a citywide boil-water notice that lasted close to a month.

""That's one of the unfortunate things when we find ourselves in what we all agree is a crisis with Jackson's water system,"" Reeves continued. ""There are enough challenges out there where we all need to work together that nobody needs to go out there and lie and make it seem worse than it really is.""

When the cold temperatures arrived, it knocked the PSI measurement of water going through the plants to 37. The PSI is usually between 80 and 90 in order to properly supply the City of Jackson.

As of Sunday, it is up to 58 psi. That is up from 55 psi Saturday, 51 psi Friday and 37 psi when the cold front came through resulting in water outages throughout the City of Jackson and City of Byram.

There are now 20 confirmed water main breaks within the city and they are continuing to work to assess and coordinate repairs.

On Friday, Dr. Williams urged neighbors to be patient. He doesn’t have a specific timeline of when the water pressure will return to normal. He pointed out there’s a lot the city can learn from this experience and said studies need to be done to see how the city can react better to these conditions.

“I think there’s always room for improvement, and we’re going to need to take a look at this particularly event and also talk to other municipalities.

The sharp criticisms were in sharp contrast to Stokes’ past endorsement of Lumumba for mayor. Stokes was also close to and endorsed the mayor’s father, a former councilman and activist who died during his first term as mayor.

Lumumba gave a press conference Tuesday in an apparent broadside against Stokes’ earlier comments, defending his administration's effort at providing water for residents. He said what happened is an act of God and rejected the allegation of incompetence against him.

""The crisis that we are in the midst of was an act of God, not through incompetence, not through a failure to act from any individual, not from a failure to act from the administration,"" Lumumba said. ""We offer as proof of the fact that this is an act of God is you just simply have to look at all of the places that this weather affected, and the fact that communities are experiencing the same trauma that our residents are experiencing today—Houston, Texas, Austin, Texas Canton, Mississippi, Vicksburg, Shreveport, Louisiana, and many more.""

Stokes: Tankers ‘Not An Act of God’

Stokes, however, said that ""the issue of tankers is not an act of God,” adding, “Let me say that because they tried to merge the cold weather and ice to tankers. Tankers could have been on the streets in Jackson long before.""

In the Wednesday interview, Stokes picked holes in the mayor's claims. He said that if the city had a white mayor, people would have been marching the streets. He claimed that Lumumba initially rejected renting a tanker because he did not like the business person who has the tanker. He did not mention who this person is. He declined to mention his name after the reporter spoke with him on the phone. The mayor’s communication manager Michelle Atoa said she has no information in response to Stokes' comments.

""This mayor had an opportunity to do something, and he did not,"" Stokes said. ""They had a businessman who had two tankers, (City Council President and Ward 6) Councilman (Aaron) Banks got one of them up, tried to get the city to pay, the mayor said I don't like him."" Banks, however, declined to respond to questions from the Jackson Free Press concerning Stokes' claims.

""So that way the citizens, the older people especially, can't have water to flush their toilet! So Councilman Banks, at that point, was reaching out to get others to pay for it. At that point, the City said they were going to pay for one tanker.”

In his response, the mayor said Stokes does “things just to give the appearance of work.”

Stokes, a long-time member of the Jackson City Council (interrupted by a stint as a Hinds County supervisor) defended himself against the mayor's accusation that he is incompetent by saying that he has introduced more legislation and passed more resolutions than any other council members.

Lumumba: Political Bickering Not Helping

The mayor on Tuesday said all the political bickering is not helping as the city tries to recover from the weather and water crisis.

""I'm calling up to those individuals that we have to work with—our council people. It isn't helpful (that) we're in the midst of a crisis, and we make it a political discussion, or we make it a fight,” Lumumba said.

The mayor said that he has been in communication with the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency and other agencies for support. He has personally given out 10 pallets of water, he said, adding that his house has also been without water and understands how people feel.

""The failure to have tankers in certain locations was not due to a lack of recognition of the challenge as it was a lack of availability; there were no tankers available to us,"" he said. ""We gave what we had; we gave what we could find.""

Lumumba said that transportation problem caused by the winter storm made it difficult to get their tankers here and that it is very difficult for him to reach the Ward 3 councilman, an allegation Stokes did not deny, saying that he cannot sit and talk with the mayor.

""You do not sit and talk and play with a liar,"" Stokes said and leveled a litany of complaints against the mayor unrelated to the water crisis. The Ward 3 councilman is known for being hard to reach by telephone.

In a statement, Banks said, ""At this time during the crisis of the majority of the city being without water, it is important that we all work together to come to the aid of our citizens.""

“We asked for $60 million at the last meeting, because we wanted to add in transmission lines. So we took the money out that we’re asking for water towers. Byram needs a water tower, at least one.

A consultant with the city said it will take about two months before a comprehensive plan to overhaul Jackson's troubled water billing system will be ready for review.

Mike Secor updated council members on Monday of progress analyzing Jackson's water and sewer billing system, as well as a look at reorganizing the city's Water/Sewer Business Administration.

He said a final report on both will be ready in approximately eight weeks.

A contract signed by Jackson and Siemens in 2012 called for replacing old water meters in the city and the billing system as well as making some capital improvements. (Photo: File photo/The Clarion-Ledger)

The plan will encompass Jackson's longstanding issues with getting water bills out to customers or reliably trusting its water meter system.

It also comes as a backdrop to the city's worst water infrastructure crisis in recent memory, which has put Jackson's water woes back in public view.

""People want to know what the city is doing to stabilize its water system,"" Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay said after the meeting. ""Finally, there's some end in sight.""

One of the problems with the current system is that the city’s meters do not transmit information in a reliable manner, meaning water meter usage is difficult to track.

The new system would have automated meters that can collect and store water billing information remotely. It will also allow customers to review and pay their bill via cellphone, as well as start or transfer service online.

For years, Jackson has lost out on millions in dollars of revenue from water collections due to widespread billing issues. The city should see about $7 million a month in water revenue, said Ward 7 Councilwoman Virgi Lindsay. Instead, it collects about half that.

""And that's been the case for years,"" Lindsay said.

The plan announcement comes almost 10 years after the city signed its $89 million contract with Siemens Industry Inc. and several Jackson subcontractors to overhaul the billing system. That contract guaranteed savings but resulted in widespread issues with the system that persist.

It was revealed in 2018 that nearly one-third of all water customers weren't getting a bill.

""We want to make sure we have the most efficient operation, more people power, more resources and understand where our strengths or weaknesses are,"" Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said.

Sheila Jackson Lee Will Distribute Groceries, Bottled Water to Houstonians in Need","The office of Sheila Jackson Lee has tweeted that the Congresswoman, along with nonprofit organization NACC Disaster Service, will be handing out bottle water and groceries to Houston communities affected by the winter storm, starting at 1 p.m. Thursday at Emancipation Park.

Lee and the NACC, a coalition of Christian churches, will start handing out water and groceries at 3018 Emancipation, before moving to Texas Christian University and later the Greenspoint area. Exact timing and locations for the two later deliveries will be announced later, likely on Twitter.

2/2 Thursday, February 18, 2021 at 1:00 PM. We’ll start at 3018 Emancipation then the truck will go to Texas Southern University and then to Greenspoint in the late afternoon. Delivering groceries and water. We’ll send the other site locations later today. — Sheila Jackson Lee (@JacksonLeeTX18) February 18, 2021

The handouts are meant to provide some relief for Houston residents who have been without water and power, many for more than 24 hours, during the state’s worst winter storm in at least a generation. Residents of the city who do have water have been under a boil water notice for about 24 hours and counting. Grocery stores throughout the city have also had to limit their hours due to a strain on the energy grid as well as supply chain issues leading to empty shelves and long entry lines.

The tweet’s from Lee’s office came about half an hour before a press conference from Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner in which he announced that the city was working on a bottled water distribution plan for residents. The city will be releasing a list of bottled water distribution sites later today.

Third Ward restaurant Turkey Leg Hut will also host a water distribution event on Thursday afternoon, starting at 2 p.m. The restaurant will hand out 14 pallets of bottled water at its location at 4830 Almeda Road thanks to a partnership with U.S. Foods. According to a press release, anyone in need of water is welcome to stop by, and distribution will be limited to one case of bottled water per car.

The move also comes amidst news that another Texas official, Senator Ted Cruz, flew to Cancun for vacation Wednesday afternoon as many of his constituents suffered bitter cold, prolonged power outages, food shortages and lack of running water. The outcry led Cruz to cut his trip short and return to Texas after just a few hours in Mexico.","Residents of the city who do have water have been under a boil water notice for about 24 hours and counting.

120,1 month ago,The Northside Sun,Virtual meeting addresses Jackson’s water issues,"Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba encouraged listeners during a virtual town hall meeting focused on the city’s water issues to contact state and national leaders and ask them to support improvements to the system.

“We need you to lift up your voices,” he said during the March 19 meeting, “From Source to Sewer: The City of Jackson’s Water System,” sponsored by the city of Jackson and the Greater Jackson Chamber Partnership and moderated by Jeff Good, president of the Chamber Partnership and owner of three Jackson restaurants

“Part of the issue is it is posed as Jackson’s problem, and yes, Jackson deals with the brunt of the problem, but when Jackson suffers the state of Mississippi suffers.”

Lumumba said during the meeting that he wants “a coalition of the willing” to work together to solve the problem.

“We don’t care about party or partisanship,” he said. “We care about results.”

About 250 people attended the meeting that also featured Charles Williams, Ph.D., director of the city’s Public Works Department; Jordan Rae Hillman, director of Planning and Development; Carla Dazet, deputy director of Public Works; Safiya R. Omari, Ph.D., chief of staff for the mayor; and Cynthia Buchanan, executive vice president at the Chamber Partnership.

Jackson City Council member Virgi Lindsay was among city, state and representative of Mississippi’s congressional delegation who listened to the meeting.

“I joined to be supportive of the Chamber and to hear the questions and concerns of participants,” she said. “I vote on funding for all of these complex matters and educated myself early on. I understood much of it before I ran for office in 2017. These are among the most challenging issues facing our city.”

The meeting focused on problems brought on by the winter storm in February that caused equipment at the city’s two water treatment plants, which are not accustomed to prolonged freezing temperatures, to malfunction. Numerous water pipes burst across the city as the system began to thaw and water pressure was restored.

Residents who had water had to boil it before drinking it after the system suffered from a drop in water pressure. Others without water had to resort to bottled water to drink and secure water to flush toilets.

The National Guard brought in tankers of non-drinkable water for residents, and many organizations gave away bottled water.

Using a PowerPoint presentation, Williams described how the water distribution system, the sanitary sewer system and the wastewater treatment process work.

Lumumba explained during the meeting that the city is taking steps to build, install and test a new water sewer billing system. Gone will be the days when some residents receive grossly inaccurate water sewer bills and others go months without receiving bills because of faulty water meters and how they communicate data for bills.

Also a factor for Jackson has been a decades-long flight of affluent taxpayers to metro Jackson suburbs, which has reduced the city’s tax base and its ability to maintain its infrastructure. Hillman said during the meeting she’s encouraged by the growth in the number residents who live in downtown Jackson because that’s good for the tax base.

Exactly where funds to overhaul the water system are coming from remains to be determined.

Lumumba requested $47 million from the state Legislature in order to shore up problems with the city’s water treatment plants.

The city could also see an additional $ 44 million from the coronavirus relief bill, which provides funding for city governments, but Lumumba has said much of that money will go to coronavirus-related expenses.

New legislation introduced in Congress could bring millions of dollars to Jackson to help improve its troubled water system.

The Emergency Water Infrastructure Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, would provide the city with assistance through a combination of loans, loan forgiveness, and grants. Funding for the legislation would come from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Economic Development Authority.

Hyde-Smith proposes authorizing $47 million through the Army Corps of Engineers Section 219 program, which would allow the agency to provide assistance for the design and construction of environmental infrastructure projects.

The bill outlines specific stipulations regarding disadvantaged communities and natural disasters, which would provide Jackson with added benefits from the EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Loans programs. Similarly, Jackson would benefit from provisions to use no less than $25 million in unobligated EDA Economic Adjustment Assistance grants funding to “eligible systems.”","Jackson City Council member Virgi Lindsay was among city, state and representative of Mississippi’s congressional delegation who listened to the meeting.

124,"Mar 5, 2021",Voice of America,"Weeks After Winter Storms, Mississippi City Still Grappling With Water Crisis","JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI - Officials in Mississippi's largest city, Jackson, are aiming to have running water largely restored by the weekend, nearly three weeks after devastating winter weather left tens of thousands of residents without service.

The city was again distributing non-potable water Friday at four sites so people can flush their toilets, and residents must still boil any faucet water before using it for food preparation, drinking, washing dishes or brushing teeth.

Charles Williams, the city's public works director, said Thursday that workers should soon be able to sample enough water to lift the boil advisory.

""I see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Williams said at a news conference, sounding more optimistic than he did Wednesday, when problems at the city's treatment plant caused pressure to drop across the entire system. At that time, he estimated that about a quarter of Jackson's 43,000 water connections — most of which serve multiple households — were not operating.

Ben Mitchell and Deon Sanders work at a public water distribution site after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, in Jackson, Mississippi, March 4, 2021.

Officials did not have an updated estimate as of Friday, though city spokeswoman Michelle Atoa said the system was able maintain pressure overnight.

Tamiko Smith, 53, spent several anxiety-filled days scrambling to find clean water to perform the at-home dialysis treatments her husband, Otis, requires four days a week.

She tracked down some packaged water at a dialysis training center. Her husband's uncle, however, who comes to Jackson to receive his own dialysis at a clinic, went three days without treatment because the facility had no access to water.

""It was very stressful,"" said Smith, who compared the situation to living in a ""third-world country.""

The problems stem from the same cold snap that wreaked havoc in Texas last month, shutting down the state's power grid and leaving millions without heat in sub-freezing temperatures.

Jackson, the state capital with a population of more than 160,000 people, has seen more than 100 water main leaks since the storm and has been repairing them as quickly as possible, officials said.

The city's mayor, Chokwe Lumumba, sent a letter to Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves earlier this week requesting $47 million in emergency funding to repair and improve Jackson's water system.

Resident Jennifer Cattenhead, 39, and her three children finally had water service return Thursday after more than two weeks without it. ""I was like, 'Oh Lord,'"" she said with relief.

Jennifer Cattenhead shows a cooler with non-potable water she's had to use for flushing water in her home after a recent bout of cold weather caused large numbers of water outages, in Jackson, Mississippi, March 4, 2021.

Cattenhead had driven miles to find stores with jugs of water in stock, and she melted ice to use for flushing toilets. The first week after the storm, her house also had no power or heat, forcing her family to sleep in their cars for warmth.

The crisis has also shuttered businesses across the city.

Jeff Good, the co-owner of three restaurants, said his pizzeria, Sal & Mookie's New York Pizza & Ice Cream Joint, would open Friday for the first time since February 17 after getting water restored Thursday.

Workers at his Broad Street Bakery & Cafe, meanwhile, were spending all day on Friday baking after the water returned ahead of reopening Saturday morning.

125,"Mar 3, 2021",KPBS,"Ronny Jackson ‘Bullied’ Subordinates And Broke Alcohol Rules, Pentagon Report Finds","Updated at 3 p.m. ET

Rep. Ronny Jackson made sexual and denigrating statements about a female subordinate, smelled of alcohol while on duty and humiliated his staff during his long stint as a White House physician, according to a scathing new report from the Defense Department's inspector general.

In one incident, the report states that when Jackson was on a presidential trip to Manila, Philippines, in 2014, he made inappropriate comments about a female medical subordinate's breasts and buttocks, got drunk with junior staff and banged on the female subordinate's door in the middle of the night, raising a commotion in the hotel.

When the woman woke up and answered the door, Jackson told her, ""I need you,"" according to the Pentagon report. After another staff member came into the hallway, the report adds, Jackson insisted they all go to his hotel room.

Jackson, a 53-year-old retired Navy rear admiral, began his White House tenure during George W. Bush's administration, working as a physician in the White House Medical Unit, which is overseen by the Defense Department. He was later appointed to the post of physician to the president by former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

The inspector general's office says Jackson ""disparaged, belittled, bullied, and humiliated"" his subordinates and fostered a toxic work environment that undermined the unit. It also says he ""engaged in inappropriate conduct involving the use of alcohol"" during two presidential trips — one to Manila and another to Bariloche, Argentina, in 2016.

The word ""alcohol"" appears 56 times in the 37-page report, which draws on initial complaints and interviews with at least 60 witnesses who previously worked in the White House Medical Unit.

Out of 60 former staff members of the White House Medical Unit who had interactions with him and were interviewed, the report states, ""Only four witnesses told us that they did not experience, see, or hear about RDML Jackson yelling, screaming, cursing, or belittling subordinates.""

The Pentagon report was sparked by a raft of allegations that surfaced in 2018, when Trump nominated Jackson to be secretary of veterans affairs. Jackson later abandoned his nomination. The accusations led to Wednesday's Pentagon report — but they did not halt Jackson's political career: The Republican was elected to Congress last November, representing a district in the Texas Panhandle.

Jackson has denied the allegations of misconduct. The Pentagon's inspector general says the former White House physician turned down chances to comment on its findings, but Jackson issued a statement Tuesday night, as news of the report's conclusions began to emerge.

""Three years ago I was the subject of a political hit job because I stood with President Trump,"" Jackson said, according to the Texas Tribune. ""Today, a Department of Defense Inspector General report has resurrected those same false allegations from my years with the Obama Administration because I have refused to turn my back on President Trump.""

As it issued its findings, the Pentagon's inspector general's office cautioned that it had been prevented from handling the case as it normally would, citing interference from the White House that occurred during Trump's presidency. It did not interview current employees at the White House Medical Unit, for instance, citing the ""chilling effect"" on those witnesses after the Office of the White House Counsel insisted on being present for their testimony.

Despite that setback, the inspector general's office says it is confident that the testimony, documents and other evidence it found was enough to make a clear determination. It recommends that the secretary of the Navy ""take appropriate action"" regarding Jackson, without providing details.

While it laid out Jackson's failings, the inspector general's report also says its inquiry found no evidence to support two other potentially damaging allegations against the high-ranking official.

""We found no evidence to support the allegation that RDML Jackson 'got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle,' "" the report states. It also did not find proof that Jackson expected rum to be stocked in his quarters during official travel or that his subordinates feared retribution if they didn't buy alcohol for their boss.

The inspector general's office concludes that on several occasions, Jackson took Ambien to sleep while flying on Air Force One. It adds that the practice prompted concern among his staff that he might not be able to perform his duties if he were called on to care for the president. The report calls for new ""fitness for duty guidance"" around using drugs such as Ambien.

Drawing on witness testimony, the findings relate how during the trip to Manila, Jackson's eyes were bloodshot and he was visibly drunk when he knocked on a female subordinate's hotel room door around 1 or 2 a.m.

The woman told the inspector general's office, ""when a drunk man comes to your room and they say, 'I need you,' your mind goes to the worst. I really felt it was a sexually inappropriate comment.""

A male member of the medical staff said he came to see why Jackson was ""pounding"" on the woman's door — and after he saw the look on his female colleague's face, he told investigators that he tried to divert Jackson back to his own room. But, he said, Jackson insisted: ""No, no. We need her. We need her. Get her. We need her.""

The woman changed out of her pajamas and grabbed her medical bag, because she wasn't sure what was going on. When she arrived in her boss's room, she said, Jackson was evidently intent on eating balut, a Philippine specialty, as a sort of culinary challenge.

As the report states, ""Balut is a fertilized bird egg that is incubated for a period of 14 to 21 days depending on the local culture, and then boiled or steamed. The contents are eaten directly from the shell.""

The female staff member described the scene in Jackson's hotel room in an interview with the inspector general's office.

""Dr. Jackson was in [the room] holding this ... grocery bag of ... balut. [RDML Jackson] said, 'Take my phone. Take my phone. We need to take pictures. I want to film this. I want to film myself eating these eggs.' And he's screaming. I kind of describe this is like frat boy type behavior.""

Jackson's attempt to eat the balut, which is often made with duck eggs, was short-lived.

The physician to the president screamed, "" 'It f***ing stinks. I can feel its f***ing feathers,' "" the woman said. At that point, she recalled thinking, ""I'm done. This is not where I want to be. I don't know what this man was coming to my room for in the first place, but this is clearly not related to my job. I'm going.""

129,"Feb 17, 2021",MLive.com,Michigan water bottling assets part of Nestle $4.3B sale to NY firm,"STANWOOD, MI — Ice Mountain is changing hands.

One Rock Capital Partners, a New York private equity firm, has purchased the bottled water brand as part of a $4.3 billion acquisition of Nestle Waters North America (NWNA), the Swiss food and beverage giant’s U.S. bottled water division.

The deal, announced Wednesday, Feb. 17, includes all of Nestle’s assets in Michigan, including a massive bottling factory in Mecosta County and several high-capacity groundwater extraction wells that have been the focus of intense criticism in recent years.

Nestle cast the sale as an effort to refocus on premium brands such as Perrier, S.Pellegrino and other mineral and bottled water brands with flavoring or other additives.

One Rock has partnered with billionaire investor Dean Metropoulos on the purchase. Metropoulos is known for reviving brands like Hostess and Pabst Brewing. Once the transaction closes, Metropoulos will become CEO and chairman.

“We look forward to working closely with our operating partners to accelerate the growth of NWNA’s extraordinary set of attractive brands, while continuing to create value in the communities in which the company operates,” said One Rock managing partner R. Scott Spielvogel.

The Nestle sale comes amid a slowdown in bottled water market growth following a boom in recent decades as consumers shifted away from soda, as well as increasing concern with the mounting single-use plastic waste created by bottled beverage manufacturing.

In Michigan, Nestle’s business model drew substantial criticism following the Flint water crisis and water shutoffs in Detroit for residents who couldn’t afford their utility bills.

The company does not pay a fee or royalty on groundwater extracted in Michigan. Instead, the company pays a $200 per-facility state paperwork fee. It also pays the standard municipal rate for water in Evart, a small town in Osceola County.

Activists argue the extraction on a controversial well near Evart has harmed the ecosystem. They are suing the state of Michigan in an effort to overturn recent permit approvals.

Sarah Dvoracek, Evart city manager, said staff at the Ice Mountain bottling plant in nearby Stanwood have told her the sale shouldn’t impact the municipal contracts.

“It’s business as usual,” Dvoracek said she was told. “I don’t anticipate it to be any different, but you never know. These people are brand new.”

Nestle put $36 million into expanding the Ice Mountain bottling plant in 2016, anticipating easy regulatory approvals for increasing groundwater extraction in Osceola County, where it operates a well that draws shallow groundwater from the headwaters of two trout streams.

Instead, news of the company’s plans generated substantial backlash that forced the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ, now called EGLE) to backpedal and put the company’s permit request under the microscope. The state granted the permit in 2018, but Nestle has yet to increase its extraction partly for logistical reasons.

State regulators on Wednesday confirmed that Section 17 permit is transferrable from Nestle to One Rock.

The Stanwood bottling plant opened in 2002. It primarily bottles the Ice Mountain spring brand and the Pure Life purified brand. Although the interstate Great Lakes compact prohibits water diversions outside of the basin, a bottling exemption within the law allows water to be sold outside the region if its shipped in bottles smaller than 5.7 gallons.

Peggy Case, president of the Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC) said the activist group is collaborating with peer groups around the country to try and determine how the One Rock acquisition will affect their advocacy efforts in others states and Canada.

The NWNA sale includes Nestle’s Poland Spring brand in Maine, Deer Park brand in Maryland, Ozarka brand in Texas, Arrowhead brand in California and Zephyr Hills brand in Florida. The Connecticut-based Nestle division has 27 production facilities across North America. The company sources water from 38 active springs throughout the country.

Case said group members in Evart have told her that local landowners who lease to Nestle were told they may have to renegotiate lease with the new owners.

Case said the group is reviewing past agreements with Nestle, such as a 2009 settlement that limits the amount of water pumping in Mecosta County, to ensure they remain enforceable.

The group, which is suing the state to overturn its permit approval, sees the One Rock acquisition as a part of a concerning trend toward privatization of water resources, particularly following a December move by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to begin trading in futures contracts for California water.

“It’s pretty obvious this is part of a bigger picture,” Case said. “It’s treating water like oil.”

“This is one more step in that dangerous trend toward commodification of water,” Case said.

DEON SANDERS: When you push this up, water going to come out from right there.

CHATLANI: Sanders is a volunteer at this water drive-through. He says dozens of people have showed up this week, including some of his classmates.

SANDERS: They said their water would cut off. They couldn't flush the toilet or whatever. So they had to come out here and get some water.

CHATLANI: The city of Jackson says that, as of Sunday, there were fewer than 10 water main breaks in the system; less than a thousand residents had no water or little water pressure. The total population is about 160,000. The majority of the city still has boil-water notices. But Charles Williams, city engineer for Jackson, says those should be lifted and other problems solved by the end of this week. He says there are a few next steps.

CHARLES WILLIAMS: Make sure that all of our residents are restored with water, take samples, get our storage tanks filled.

CHATLANI: The areas of Jackson still impacted are predominantly Black and low-income. And some residents say even if their water is on, it comes out dirty. So to get by, people are going to drive-through giveaways and collecting rainwater, staying clean with alcohol wipes or going to a friend's to bathe. And three weeks into this crisis, residents are now dealing with issues that go far beyond the plumbing - for example, Forest Hill High School.

ROCKY KHANNA: Several hundred students were without water.

CHATLANI: Rocky Khanna is a teacher at Forest Hill. He says they were starting to bring students back to the classroom with COVID-19 safety precautions, but during the storm, the school had to close. It still doesn't have water.

KHANNA: And we have to have a certain level of water pressure or water to actually return.

CHATLANI: Khanna says the school has been busing meals to students and making sure they have water. But he's afraid these last few weeks could further slow down students.

KHANNA: Or they may not even have access to the Wi-Fi and Internet.

CHATLANI: Jackson Mayor Chokwe Lumumba says it's important that the city invests in low-income communities, even after the water is turned back on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHOKWE LUMUMBA: What is the poverty rate? What is the quality of education? What is the stability of our infrastructure? Development goals that really should be the metric of success of any economy.

CHATLANI: Lumumba says residents need access to basic resources so they are prepared to weather any storm.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — Veteran receiver DeSean Jackson agreed to a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, returning to his native Southern California after 13 NFL seasons on the East Coast.

Jackson will provide a deep threat for new quarterback Matthew Stafford. The deal also reunites Jackson with Sean McVay, his offensive coordinator for three seasons in Washington.

The 34-year-old Jackson spent his first six NFL seasons and the last two with the Philadelphia Eagles, but he played in just eight games over the last two years due to injuries.

The speedy wideout had the best season of his career in 2013 with 82 catches for 1,332 yards and nine touchdowns for the Eagles, and he followed it with two 1,000-yard seasons for Washington under McVay’s leadership. Jackson then spent two seasons with Tampa Bay before rejoining Philadelphia in 2019.

Jackson has spoken in past offseasons about his interest in reuniting with McVay and in playing back home in California. The Rams were in the market for a speedy deep threat to add contrast to McVay’s short-pass offense, and Jackson appeared to be an ideal fit even before the Rams got the deal done.

When McVay was asked Friday about the possibility of signing another receiver, the coach smiled and replied: “We’re always trying to add some juice.”

Jackson was born in Los Angeles and grew up in the Crenshaw district. After a standout career at prep powerhouse Long Beach Poly, he spurned USC’s interest and moved north to play three collegiate seasons at California.

Jackson will join fellow Los Angeles-area native Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp as the Rams’ top receivers. Josh Reynolds, the Rams’ No. 3 receiver last season, is an unsigned free agent, while Van Jefferson is expected to get much more playing time in 2021 after being used sparingly as a rookie.

Woods, Kupp and Jefferson are all excellent receivers, but all three play a game based on precision, not overwhelming speed.

Jackson has led the NFL in yards per reception four times in his career — and if he’s healthy, he could fit the Rams’ needs perfectly.

McVay had Sammy Watkins as a deep threat in 2017, and he was followed by Brandin Cooks in 2018 and 2019. Los Angeles traded Cooks early last year and didn’t replace his speed.

“When you definitely have skill players with juice, that can threaten the top shelf of the (opponents’) coverage,” general manager Les Snead said Friday when asked about the importance of signing a deep threat.

“The difficult part of the equation is finding those players who can actually threaten NFL defenders, because most players that come into this league are fast,” Snead added. “So there is an element where you have to really go search and identify. We’d all love to identify those guys that can even threaten NFL defenders.”

Now, the village is responding with a plan to fix the issues.

Mayor Linda Jackson spoke to 12 News on Wednesday about the water issues in the village and said that most of them are due to old pipes and water mains that need to be replaced.

Jackson said the cost is too much for the village right now, so they are looking to raise prices on water for residents to cover those expenses, saying that the water department does not take any money from the village's annual budget.

With just one operational well in Endicott, Jackson said that there's more stress on it than there should be. She added that the village has begun sampling different sites to see where they can drill new wells.

Jackson said that this could be a solution that could take years, but added that it needs to start now.","VILLAGE OF ENDICOTT (WBNG) -- Endicott residents recently expressed their concern over brown water coming from their faucets.

137,"Mar 15, 2021",WJTV,Cool Schools: Wingfield High School helps community during water crisis,"JACKSON, Miss. (WJTV) – Wingfield High School came together to help the community during the water crisis.

The thought of students without water kept Wingfield High School Graduation Coach, Fredrick Connors, up at night.

“I could not sleep knowing that our scholars were in that type of situation,” said Connors.

So Connors took initiative. He asked teachers and staff members if they wanted to donate their own money to buy water and food for the students and community members. Together, they raised about $1200.

“We have given away about 20 pallets of water,” said Connors, “Which equates to maybe two thousand cases of water.”

Connors and Wingfield High School staff members held about four events. Not only did they give out water, but food too.

“Because of the outage of electricity most of the food people had perished,” said Connors, “They needed food.”

Parents and students in need were so grateful. They left a mark on Connors.

“It was so rewarding it makes me tear up,” said Connors, “We really care wholeheartedly and that is what we do.”

Wingfield High School Principal, Roderick Smith, said having staff members who care about their students is the key to their success. He also thanked Connor’s for taking the initiative to create the drives.

“I have to give credit where credit is due,” said Smith, “Mister Connors had the vision and he has been working it out ever since.”

Connors said he could not have done it without the other staff members at Wingfield High School.
